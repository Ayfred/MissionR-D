"Nicely designed, has a good selection of workout options, and does a good job tracking my sleep (via a Galaxy Watch 4). I do wish that there was an option to add a note or a journal entry for a sleep session, even if it was something simple. In regards to the watch app, I think there should be more breathing cycles in the ""Stress"" section (you can only add up to 30 cycles / 7 mins)."
"Good but buggy. There also appears to be no way to report bugs. Update: Still 2 stars. Yes, you can contact them (via chat or call), but my experience is they tell you to reset the watch, which, in my experience, helps nothing, and requires you to set your watch back up (manually), because ""backup"" doesn't back up everything. Maybe the other watches aren't any better."
"Mediocre at best. Features frequently don't work. Body composition works maybe 30% of the time and then stops whether the watch isn't tight enough, your arms aren't far enough out, or maybe because it's a Tuesday. Sleep features work about half the time and require special positioning of your connected phone. Generally junk. Samsung should stick with phones. It's the only thing they can do reasonably well"
"ECG is about as reliable as picking a piece of paper out of a hat with the results written on it. Automatic exercise is terribly inaccurate. Their watch app is just an overall terrible user experience since you have to deal with their static ordering of the features. Like counting my water intake, but it is stuck at the bottom of the list, making it very inconvenient, which is kinda the point of apps on your watch. There are a millions things this app could be, but right now ""good"" isn't one."
"I have this synced with another app and used to have no problems with that capability. However, I now frequently experience workouts that are not synced. Somehow this app restarted and the sync worked fine for a couple of days. Unfortunately, now it doesn't- AGAIN! VERY frustrating. Also, the distance is not even close to being accurate if I'm jnside my apartment building, even when I'm walking the halls very near the parameter of the building."
"The app has been slowly losing features for a long time. Logging anything has been a chore for a while but now it is simply tedious. For example, I can't seem to scan food labels anymore. Everything must be manually entered. Strange that Samsung doesn't care about this app since they also try to sell their watches based off this companion app. The app is no good. But it is free... Update: I will contact no one. You read the review."
"It is a good app, but it can be improved, and has downgraded in little ways. For instance, the scheduling for workouts should be customizable to have a daily or weekly routine and set up by the user, and not just be three days automatically. There is now a problem where I would have to download the workout vids every time I use the program, which is just kinda dumb and a waste of time. But overall, it's good for it meassure your steps and distance."
"Work fine with my phone then just stopped, it records about 10% of my steps, found that by using a pedometer. I also don't think the sleep monitoring is very useful, you cannot manually enter data if you get up and then go back to sleep. If you get up and go the bathroom then back to bed no way to account for that. Your app does not allow for interrupted sleep. You can enter start and end, nothing else."
"It seems to do a decent job collecting data from the watch, but the sleep data is messed up. If I sit and read a book whether it's in the kitchen or the living room it records me as sleeping. Many times while I'm relaxing/preparing for bed, it records me as sleeping. When I have difficulty falling asleep it doesn't seem able to tell I'm awake. So, much of my sleep data is messed up. I have had to reset the watch when the battery dies. And it doesn't save or sync the data collected before it died"
"Most of the app is very good. The sleep party is amazing! The step count is very inaccurate unless you are on a long gps-worthy walk around the neighborhood, not great inside the house just walking around. I can't figure out how to turn off the ""together"" challenge once I started it. Otherwise it is great!"
"I use this app everyday to record my daily walk, and when completed check for distance, time and step count. The best feature about it was the fact that you could review your route with the map feature, this worked well up until Tuesday. I did my walk on Wednesday and went to review my route and that feature has now been removed, why? This is really disappointing. This app had everything. Please return the map/route feature."
Every time they update this it gets worse. I no longer get workout notifications. The steps no longer show unless I go into the app and the weekly and monthly bar graphs have vanished. Do me a favor stop updating this and put it back the way it was. If I could give you zero stars I would. As soon as I find another one l like I am deleting this from my phone.
"This app functionality has broken in the past week. I use my galaxy watch to track all of my workouts (strength training, running, walking, jump rope, etc...). It won't load the calendar any longer, so that I can review my workouts. It also used to allow me to track workouts without my watch, say I left it home or forgot to charge it. This is no longer available. Rather than reduce functionality, Samsung really needed to add functionality, like adding custome exercises to watch."
"Update: I already checked what was suggested and turned the notifications for the steps off, then back on again, and restarted my phone. Nothing has fixed this issue. I even have a screenshot to show what it looks like. I typically like using the app. Just did an update, and now my steps are not showing up on my main screen. I've gone through all my settings even though I didn't change anything."
"It's useful when it works. I have trouble sleeping and I wanted to monitor it. Unfortunately for me, the sleep tracker only works about 20% of the time. I thought my watch was the issue, so I retired the one I was wearing and upgraded to the Galaxy Watch 5. No changes. Since then, I've uninstalled and reinstalled the app multiple times, cleared the cache over and over, rebooted my watch, factory reset my watch, reset my phone... I'm at a loss. I just want it to work like it's supposed to."
"Love this app, and have used it ever since I can remember. Recently got my first ever smart watch, Galaxy Watch5 Pro. I use the app on the daily, for sleep, and steps. The sleep feature is fascinating! There's only one thing missing. There are other apps for ahead of this one, when it comes to recording food intake. This app does not have the capability to scan food/drink products. HUGE con. Why can't you add that in? No one wants to have multiple connected apps. Add this, & get the last ‚≠ê"
"I recently upgraded my Samsung watch and can't say I'm super pleased with it. I am finding it absolutely doesn't track my floors properly, even after I've done all tricks suggested. It thinks I'm sleeping if watching a movie & will add to my sleep time. Says we can edit, but also impossible to edit without deleting entire sleep for the night. watch has changed screens several times without my prompting & will also start unknown exercises without prompting. bonus I do get more exercise options"
"Total calories burned removed so now you can only see calories burned from exercising on previous days. This makes it difficult if you're calorie deficit focused. Called support and they just told me to clear my cliche data and turn my phone off for a minute. If the watch is monitoring my heart properly, it would be nice to see the estimated total calories I have burned throughout the day and is where other apps benefit over this one. Disappointed."
"Sleep charts could use work. Doesn't combine sleep when there are multiple segments, by design, it only shows the last one for a day. This makes it useless for trying to compare trends of sleep cycles. EDIT: Developer responded but clearly didn't read feedback. This is a design error. Show it to someone who isn't going to parrot nonsense troubleshooting steps."
"-3 stars because you can't edit workout (distance, time, trim, etc). As I have used this watch more, the lack of this feature has made me go to other apps such as Google Fit that work less well with the watch. This makes the app useless for things like treadmill workouts where the GPS isn't used for finding distance. The watch is useful for stuff like heartrate or step count but completely useless for pace and distance because it always gets the distance completely wrong."
"First it wouldn't let me sign in with Google. So I made an account. Now it keeps saying ""you don't have to do 2FA right now or allow optional permissions, basic functions still work"" but that's a lie. It takes me to screen after screen saying I NEED to allow/do certain things to use the app. All I need is to record the data from my watch which is connected to my phone. I don't need the app to track my steps, that's why I have the watch ffs. Every step it keeps getting worse. Regret downloading."
"I sometimes wake in the middle of the night. I will either read, do morning studying, watch a movie, or look at my phone. It still shows that I'm sleeping. I wish I could edit that time off of the sleep record like I could on iFit. There is an edit option, but the only thing you're allowed to do is delete the entire record of sleeping that night."
"there's a menu to edit sleep but it only lets you delete. when watching movie it detects as sleep, there's no way to delete partial (delete first part or change the time of the sleep record) so when you delete and add manually it just erases all the sleep cycle data. there needs to be an option to just edit the time so that I can modify to actual time I went to bed and woke up. it thinks I was ""sleeping but awake"" when using my phone in bed until I physically get up."
Past two nights it didn't record my exercises but did record heart rate. I sync it with Supernatural VR app and that app recorded my exercise just fine. Tonight the Supernatural app only recorded my heart rate at 85 while Samsung Health showed it in the 150's and didn't record my exercise. Why? Update Now it is randomly not recording my heart rate for hours at a time. And yes the watch is on correctly. I've even rebooted the watch and the phone. This is really frustrating.
"I've always liked this app, but in the last month I for some reason have lost the ability to track speed, steps, and distance on my treadmill. It is one of the few things that I always use. I've done everything I can do make sure it would work. I've tried to figure out where to send screen shots and cannot figure that out. The watch works fine if I reset it, then the next day it don't work again. I've reset it 2 times and the same thing happens."
I like the app. Just wondering when a cup went from 8oz to 8.4oz. This is what is tracked/logged for water intake. As for the food log- it only allows for 6 entries. It would be nice if we had the option to add additional meals/times. It would be a big help if the app would scan bar code and pick up the nutritional information from the item. Having to search and create is time consuming.
"Heart rate recovery data is gone? Up until today's workout, HRR was always shown under the heart rate zones....now it does not appear. Other than that, app is great. Update: The good news is that when I called the number they provided, I was able to speak with a representative within 1 minute so that is great news. The bad news is that this is a known and recent defect that they're working on. Not quite sure why they couldn't have answered that question directly rather than telling me to call."
"Within the last few weeks, the steps counter is wildly inaccurate! The app says I am up all night long walking while I am asleep. I do not wear my watch at night and my phone stays plugged in next to my bed. And other times it doesn't count my steps when I am up and walking. But mostly it says I am walking when I am not. Not sure what changed but this app has become useless."
"Love the app and is great, but is missing some things way basics, Vo2 levels for riding bicycle (is available for running but no for riding), the ability to connect a cadence sensor to my smartwatch ( it allows it only the phone), Now if Samsung wanna take to the next level should incorporate a glucose sensor or at least activate the one on the device already, that would be awesome. Samsung Apple is killing it with apple watch pro, we need to represent, or we gonna be replaced."
"WHY would you include AWAKE time in total sleep time graph?? Awake is the opposite of asleep!!! Useless! Customer service not knowledgeable: Watch didn't synchronize. After update Bluetooth on watch was turned off. They didn't even suggest to check that. (Watch will partially sync with WiFi, but not well.) They just told me I couldn't have airplane mode on, which is false! Synching fine with Bluetooth & airplane mode. (I cannot use cellular, because I get virtually ZERO battery life on watch.)"
"Maximum and average speeds are reversed. It is impossible for your average speed to be higher than your maximum speed, that's just simple math. Distance calculation is off by around 20% when compared to multiple other sources (which all agree to within 1%). But, the app is fairly easy to use. And my wife and I find it useful for monitoring relative progress vs real numbers. App would rate a 5 if the obvious fixes were done."
"Several functions now don't work!!!! I had an old Samsung S10 phone and I could monitor my heart rate, stress level, oxygen, etc.  Now I upgraded to the Samsung S22 Ultra and I can't do any of that.  Why not?  Only part of the app now works. I have un-installed it and reinstalled it several times. This is a great app for older model phones I guess. So now I will have to find another one."
"This is a pretty good app, but there are a few things that it could use. You should, for instance, be able to save a workout program for later use. If you do one that you would like to try again you have to go searching for it. The other thing is the EKG app, Idk why it's separate. They could just as easily be in the same app, and the EKG might also function at that point. I've never gotten that app to simply open correctly."
"The best app for anything fitness hands down! It's free!! It is easy to customize meals, adjust servings, or even add a new food! It gives science-based ""fad-free"" information and new features get added all the time! It needs improvements however, tracking some vitamins are impossible with the app. The food 60% of the time are incorrect calories or missing nutrient info. It needs to add the ability to scan a smart label and import. Best fitness app out there hands down!!!"
"The main function I used the app for, weight loss management, was removed. A few of the features are still there, you can manually set a calorie target and a weight target, but they are no longer integrated. I liked having the calorie target automatically adjust based on my weight loss goals. Also, since Samsung's flagship phones no longer have a pulse oximeter, the oxygen, O2, and stress monitoring functions are useless as well."
"App is very inconsistent. It sometimes records sleep and exercise accurately and oftentimes it is missing or very inaccurate. It is synced with my Galaxy watch but is giving incomplete or no data. It used to work fairly well, but no longer. This was the primary reason for getting the Galaxy phone and watch. It has gotten much worse since the last ""update""."
"I wish I could give this like a 4.5/5 stars. The only problem I have is the Running Coach. As a beginner, I've found this tool to be extremely helpful! I just wish it could do a tad bit more. Couple of things I'd like to see: Ability to change frequently of ""keep this pace"" and ""slow down/speed up"" messages Running Coach to suggest workouts/runs based on goals and experience level (it kind of does this now, but I don't think the current suggestion are helpful) Ability to change the coach voice"
"Everything works fine, but my gosh, please improve the fitness tab! There's barely any programs that require no equipment. Some that claim to be beginner level, particularly the fencing program, are NOT for beginners. Having once been at a point where I could do it with ease, that one is far from beginner. Do you know how bad someone could hurt their hip trying to do the 2nd and 3rd modified lunges without proper stretching practice?? Terrible idea! Fix the labeling, add new beginner courses!"
"They're having major time issues right now. This is especially apparent with my sleep data. It changed my sleep/wake time, and workout times by like 7 hours. Totally unacceptable. Edit: I've already contacted customer service through the Samsung Members app. They said the issue should be fixed in the next update. Edit 2: I gave the app another chance and the issue seems to have been solved. However, the data recorded while the issue was active is still corrupted."
"It's a lightweight yet comprehensive app, so it's easy for someone like me who forgets to input my data to still do a decent job of tracking my activity. The useful features have been automatic activity tracker, sleep reminder, and automatic sleep detection (based on phone inactivity). It does seem like the UI gets a little worse and the features decrease after every update. For example, the decision to remove the stress tracking and heart rate tracking features was silly and inconvenient."
"Finally working again so I'm changing my review. It's the only thing that works really well with my Gear Fit2, but if we're being honest there is a bit that could be updated. Tracking meals is painful as it doesn't tell you what a serving is considered, you can't put in future times, and there's no barcode scanner. It could just be better. I'm also still upset they removed the caffeine tracker. But I do like the water and sleep tracking as well as the exercise tracker."
"I had a Samsung S10, so I was able to benefit from all of the data points. Now that I have the S22 Ultra, most of the data points are useless. I do not wear a watch and do not intend to. I do workout with a heart monitor on my arm, so I can get that data but I might as well use their app as it syncs easier. I am now looking for a new app. I do like the sleep tracking, but it's not worth it enough to keep this app. Plus, now you won't back up my period info? Yeah, I'm out!"
"Latest update removed the identifier of which watch is syncing. For those of us with more than one watch this is a downgrade, and I hope the next update returns this handy feature. Also the blood glucose recording needs a place for notes for each measurement, and the ability to edit the day and time, if it's going to be truly useful. You should be able to note how you're feeling, medications, etc."
"Last several weeks the app doesn't work properly. The fitness data on the phone and both Samsung watches don't match. On phone, I see more than should be calories burned and activity minutes. On the other hand, after synchronization watches show only the correct amount of steps and only a few calories and minutes even though I just finished my fitness exercises."
"Generally, helpful app. But, has a major problem with transitions with Daylight Savings Time. Most recently, my Samsung watch caught my sleep correctly but the Health app interpreted the data incorrectly. Unable to describe how messed up my sleep record is, but suffice it to say the chart bars show 6'42"" but the app says 4'42"". Part of the night recorded sleep shows on app but isn't counted by app. The app total says 3'1"" but manually adding the actual hours calculates to almost 7'."
"I don't use, nor want to use, a smart watch at night so have been manually tracking my sleep with this app for 6 yrs. It's pretty straightforward: you enter the time you slept and rate it. But what's great is when it senses when you're using the phone to estimate your sleep. This is great ... when it works. For some reason, it rarely does and I don't understand why it's so hard to figure this out. If they could fix that, I would give it 5 stars. By the way, the step tracker works great."
"The app is good for logging exercises, but absolutely useless for food logging. I've tracked food on multiple different apps and know very well what makes tacking easy, useful, and intuitive. Samsung health has non of these for food tracking. No barcode scanner, only a horrible dial that takes forever to change quantity, less information on products and their micros/macros, and no way to split food between different times of day."
"Annoying. I turned off notifications, but I'm still getting annoying notifications. It's a decent app, but I'm about to delete it, if it keeps this up. Also, I've used the app for years, but a recent forced upgrade was implemented a few weeks ago. I HATE the new interface and the changes. Not nearly as intuitive, easy to use, functional as it used to be. If it ain't broke, don't fix it. Shame."
"Graphs are horribly arranged, exorcism for setting long term tends. Cannot manually edit the types of workouts after the fact. List of exercises is far too limited. No ability to scan barcodes for calorie logging. Need to go to submenu to add by meal, scroll and tap for entries (to many taps). Decimal places too coarse. Voice during exercise mispronounces words like ""total."""
Edit: i now have a Samsung watch and i hate the app even more. Im going back to fitbit as their app is not insanely complicated. Nothing talks to each other and everything shows something different. I've only had the watch for a day and can't get rid of it fast enough. Missing features. I use to love this app especially the pulse oximeter and it keeps telling me to use the watch. I don't have a Samsung watch.
This is definitely a great app for health. A majority of the time the nutrients are all there and correct. I understand why sugar may not be included within meals but that would definitely help. My only real suggestion is if we were able to make custom meals but like add multiple foods. An example would be a breakfast that consists of multiple things or like a homemade sandwich. Other than that great app üî•
"Okay app overall. I like the variety of workouts you can track as you do different activities. However there needs to be an editing feature that allows for you to change the duration of the workout, intensity of the workout, any additional weight, and anything to help make the calorie count more accurate. Especially when I'm doing any kind of strength training I'd like to track the weight, number of reps, and number of sets I perform as part of my workout."
Overall great app for tracking the basics. Been using it on and off for several years and haven't had any issues. The Nutrient Intake Summary graph is a much better visual representation compared to other apps I've used. Only suggestion I would have is that I'd love to see sugar added to the nutrient info section.
"Good App! The sleep analysis is noteworthy. The app presents the measurement data of the Watch5 clearly. I still wish a few improvements so that I can correlate sleep (REM, low, light, awake) with blood oxygen saturation and pulse in time (e.g. cursors with time marks). Positive-Example: Training Tab - correlation between slope, speed and pulse in one diagram. The display of the ECG is very good in graph paper grid and also exportable, but unfortunately I cannot zoom into it."
"Overall great app for synchronizing the health data from my Galaxy Watch, with one major issue that warrants taking off 3 stars. The connection with my Strava account keeps disconnecting - at least once a month - and it's incredibly frustrating. The only way I know I have to reconnect is my workouts stop showing up in Strava - I'm not notified of this disconnection. Please fix this - it's adding way too much unnecessary friction using this app."
"I love the app but the only critique I have is finding it annoying to have to search when I try to log my meals, i think it could be so much easier if you use the camera function to be able to snap a picture of the barcode of what you eat and it automatically adds all the data from the serving size and you could adjust how much you eat/if you had 1 or 1.5 or 0.75 servings."
"This has has completely stopped tracking my sleep times since November 1st. Before that everything was perfect. I like to track how long I sleep and this app WAS perfect for that. Now it doesn't even do it, you have to enter stuff in manually instead of the app detecting when you're not using fmyour phone for hours throughout the day."
"A step count keeps us aware of days when we don't enough, this is good. I also like the sleep app... While I know it's not scientifically accurate for sleep, it's a reasonable picture of overall sleep patterns. One note, my sleep times were skewed from actual time for a few weeks, I unintentionally let my watch battery die, and after the next charge, the issue corrected itself."
"I can't edit recorded data or am I missing something? My watch 4classic and my S22 ultra are constantly recording wrong sleep data that can't be edited. The data clearly shows that I'm awake, yet still records as sleep so now it says I've slept 8 hours but was awake for 2. I honestly don't know why I'm bothering to leave a review because I will just get a generic cookie-cutter ""contact us"" response just to be told again that there's nothing that can be done to fix it. Last Samsung I'll ever buy."
"Great app, helps me to track a variety of health-related stats depending on my focus at the time. One major issue, though, blood glucose trend for 12 month recently stopped working for no reason I can see. Despite having more than six months of data it now only displays a single month (March 2022) and there doesn't seem to be a way to reset or refresh it."
App is easy to use and integrates great with my watch and phone. But! The data is mediocre. Average speed for snowboarding? Why? We need better data fields. We need to navigate the map easier during and after activities. We need a way to plan routes that is easier to integrate into established apps. We need top speed. Samsung needs to step it up.
Still Buggy on the S10+. The step meter keeps freezing. Sometimes restarting the phone is the only way to make it work again. The food diary is lacking everything. All the things like carbs and vitamin is not always available. It keeps crashing. I have to clean the cache at least twice a week.
"Updated: Uninstalled App 10/29/22, ReInstalled. Still doesn't work. No tenths in Audio distance completed. You need to do a new Update. Since the last update, the audio guide on workouts is dropping the tenths (0.?) On distance completed. 2.5 miles is given audibly as only 2 miles, no tenths are voiced. Whereas speed, mph, are voiced correctly. I have mine set for 0.5 mile audible notification. Only the whole number is given even at the 1/2 mile point."
"I've been using this app for years and have always loved it but on 12/7 there was an update and now my time is off by like 5 hours! For example I went to sleep at 2am and woke up at 11am but the app recorded that I went to sleep at 7am and woke up at 4pm. Same with my step count, at midnight it should reset but it's showing over 2000 steps! Please fix this! Also, blood oxygen during sleep is an option in my phone but not on my galaxy watch. I would love to be able to have that option on my watch"
"Good data, only a few hiccups. I didn't realize that the Health app needs to be actively open on the phone in order for the snore detection to have permissions for the microphone. And here for weeks I believed that my snoring had vastly improved. I accept that this is more of an Android OS issue than the app, but not having mic permissions all the time requires the user to remember to open the app every bedtime before placing it on the charger. (Old dog, new tricks.)"
"Why am I being prompted to enable location and enable weather EVERY time I choose the ""walk"" exercise. I turned these permissions off on purpose. They're turned off on my watch and within the Samsung Health app. I don't want location information turned on, this is my personal choice. I'm so tired of being hassled about it, and I can't find a way to make it stop asking me every time I choose ""walk."" So frustrating."
"Why can't the app figure out that if I've done 2 exercise classes in one day, I've been highly active. I'm tired of the discouraging remarks that I've been ""less active than normal. It's also ridiculous that if I enter ""2 Miles "" walked, the app can't figure out that I've actually used steps to walk 2 miles. So I still get discouraging comments about having been less active than normal. Simple Samsung: edit the settings so the app figures out the steps used in every workout added."
"Awesome app! I've lost more weight and gotten in better shape than I have been in years. It would be nice to be able to copy and paste meals, like if I have dinner and then eat the leftovers for lunch the next day, but don‚Äôt want to make it a custom meal. It would also be cool if the exercise app compared my performance on specific routes. Like ""that's the fastest you've ran that particular route."""
"Just got a new Samsung Smartwatch Galaxy 4, and have enjoyed a lot of the features this app has. There are so many things this can track, looking forward to trying out all the options! My only complaint right now would be that I have to turn on the Dark Mode setting for my entire phone to use this app in Dark Mode. I have many other apps that have their own Dark Mode setting, so it would be so much better if I could just toggle that on for the Samsung Health app by itself."
"I recently got a pixel 7 upgrading from a pixel 6. When I try to start the Samsung health app on the phone it takes me to a startup screen where there is a big green button saying Sign In. No credentials have yet to be entered since there are no fields to enter the credentials. When I click the button, I get four small circles which circles in the center of the screen and nothing happens after that. I have uninstalled installed the app multiple times with no change in the behavior."
"The last update has changed settings, it is no longer on my home screen. I keep getting a message ""location detection has restarted"" where I used to be able to see my steps. The steps don't seem to be counting properly. It was hit and miss before but now it is practically useless and unreliable. I thought updates were supposed to improve performance, not obliterate them!"
"I love using this app! The monthly challenges spur me on, running training programmes have an audio commentary as you go, which is great! I'd love to see a training programme with audio for heart rate training/building aerobic base. I find most features of this app to be useful and accurate, although I would love to see some changes with the Food intake. The nutritional breakdowns are not very accurate, particularly with potassium,iron, and some other vitamins and minerals."
"Used to use this app for everything - exercise, sleep tracking, calorie tracking, water -, but it's super frustrating that syncing doesn't work anymore. Lost all my data from 3+ years. When I contacted customer service, they couldn't help me and told me to go to a physical Samsung store - as if I'd bother to do that for an app. Step counter is also awful now. If I go for a walk with someone, they'll have like triple the amount of steps this app detects."
"In the past, it was a great app, tracked my workouts synced from my Samsung watch wonderfully, recently it hasn't been doing that, it just randomly disconnects at days and misses out on a bunch of workout logs which is frustrating. Came here to see other reviewers having the same issue so I guess they just up and decided to eff up a perfectly functional app. Don't tell me to contact the developers with a dumb automated response, I believe many people have clearly explained the issues already."
"Great app with easy to understand metrics and tips, but... 1. I often forget to end my workout sessions, and wish there was a way to edit the recorded data. That way I could shorten the workout to discard bad data but keep the actual workout data. 2. I wish there was a way to hide the ""fitness for women"" section of the Fitness tab. It is content catered to pre/post pregnancy and period cycles; I don't need or want to see content that's not relevant to my body in the fitness programs."
"This is a great app for measuring any level of exercise and I have been using since 2017. I'd give it a 5 star rating and have recommended it to many of my friends and family. However, I started experiencing problems with inaccurate distance and speed readings and reported twice on the app under settings/contact us but haven't heard from the team. I walked again this evening and experienced the same problem. Please help."
"Ruined a great app. Used to track my walks so I could go back to them. Now instead of showing a map with my walk clearly defined, it shoes a map with straight lines to random locations on my walk as though I flew over the houses in a straight line. Gutted. It's just rubbish now. That's what happens when people try to be too clever."
"I've been using this app to track my weight since Jan 2018. It was really satisfying to see the sharp downward turn on the 12 month graph when it was going well, and motivating to see the sharp upward turn when it wasn't going so well. Since the most recent update, this tracker is now basically useless as the graph's vertical axis changes as you scroll along, so that even a 10kg weight loss shows as an almost straight line. This completely misses the point of a graph! 4yrs of data now useless."
"I love this app. I use it with my Samsung fit2 to track steps, and sync with myfitnesspal to track macros. Since the last update the body composition scale starts at weight 0 - which is REALLY annoying since no healthy adult would weigh less than say 120lbs upwards. This means when logging my weight I used to see an accurate reflection of where I have gained or had a loss across a week - now because the scale is so large I can only see dots in a line. Fix this fault - and it will be perfect"
"I was very happy with it until today. Stopped showing the steps number and instead started showing ""Samsung Health Started."" Looked for the solution online, told me to clear cache, and if that doesn't work to clear data. Now it's completely empty and that makes me sad. EDIT: It restored my data, and everything is back the way it's supposed to be."
"I used to love this apo. Been using it since my first Samsung phone in 2017. BUT since the last update it's garbage. It randomly stops counting my steps, which is absolutely infuriating because I have very specific goals at the moment. When you walk 8kms a day, and your phone registers only 78 steps?? Incredibly disappointing. It's NOT my phone, Samsung."
"Keeps notifying me that the session has expired and that I need to log in again. Clicking the notification prompts the loading logo with nothing else. Actually opening the app shows that I'm logged in. ü§î Inconsistent sleep recording with my Samsung watch, bad sync with Google Fit. For a moment I considered switching to a Samsung phone, but now that I see their level of software - NOPE. And the next fitness tracker won't be a Samsung watch either."
"I really just started re-using the app a few days ago after I noticed it was no longer tracking my steps automatically. Turns out it had a service agreement update, so I confirmed. It seems like it still stops tracking my steps daily unless I go back into the app. Today I noticed it wasn't tracking my steps in real time anymore. Even after closing & re-opening the app, it wouldn't change the number of steps even as I was walking. Not sure what that's about."
Lots of the features are great. Biggest downfall is how lazy the effort for the workouts are. 84% of gym goers use weights and this app dosent even have weighted squats. In 2023 I expected a lot more from an app like this. I've ended up making my own after only 2 months of learning software coding to give you an idea how easy it is to put in. If this weren't the case the app works really well and has a brilliant finish. And would be a 4.5.
"It's fine for calorie counting but incredibly inaccurate for nutrition. Not only have they removed the caffeine tracker part but they have taken away weight management as well would be 5 stars if not for these issues. Edit: they've also now removed most of the foods I normally eat, so I have to make custom meals, which takes a lot of time out of my day."
"I have been using Samsung Health since I bought my S6 years ago. Never dissapoint until I changed my mobile and watch (S23 Ultra+ Watch 5). Since then, it won't count treadmill steps! No matter how much I tinkered with the setting (clear cache, permissions, update os). I installed Strava just to test my watch and it tracked my exercises accurately, distance, heart rate etc. Clearly, this is not a hardware issue, but apps!!! Please fix this."
"Been using this with a samsung smartwatch for over a year now. Basic functions work for a few days then stops working correctly (if at all) for months just for this circle to repeat it self. With the latest update heartbeat is now again registered, trade off is gps not working at all now. The only feature thats been consistent is the leader board. Shame it is always toped with cheaters. Oh, and if a session is started from the watch rather than the app, it acts diffrently for some reason."
"I had enjoyed this app previously but all of the updates lately seem to have broken this. Anytime I do a run the pace is stuck at 10 minutes per mile, even with good GPS signal. The mile tracker when I complete a lap will show a correct time usually 8 or 830 but the purpose of this is fitness tracking and it is causing the vo2 max and all of the other calculations in correct. I've already contacted Samsung at the number given with no help."
"When paired with Galaxy Watch 5 Pro, sleep time is reported inaccurately. I turn on sleep mode when I lay down at night and turn it off as soon as I wake up. I normally use the bathroom immediately after rising, sometimes for an extended period, and even though sleep mode turned off, it doesn't record me as awaking for another 20-30 minutes when I leave bathroom. This skews sleep reporting."
"The app icon is due an update? Especially since this is not an app just for women. It would be good if the app could have a web browser companion. It would be good if more photos could be added to workout beyond the limited 3. It would be good if equipment could be added to training sessions, so equipment odometer readings could be used."
Hi. I like this app a lot and i use it daily. But is it possible to include 'free weights' into the exercise menu? That would be a big plus if you could. It's not so easy to select different exercises for certain categories all the time. It would be so much better if there's an option for 'free weights'. That would be a big plus! Please consider. Thank you.
"DO NOT BUY SAMSUNG GALAXY WATCH 4 It's a waste of money and the design of the watch is intentionally meant for you to crack it with its protruding screen. To repair it, it costs about the same as a new watch. Get any other brand and it will be better. Less than a year there also battery issues and it can't be fix because I have to pay for a new screen. The data does not track properly. The sleep data is always off and does not count automatically, and when it does no sleep data is shown."
"I have 3 health apps on my phone, and as for accuracy, this step counter is totally different to the other two. Some days it doesn't even start up. Most days it is out of sync with the other two apps with anything from a 1000 to 3000 steps. The other two apps are in total sync only differing by a slight margin"
Many great features... Need more widgets. I wish there were more widget options. Like a small graph for weight progress and one for exercise time. But otherwise I love that it has so many different health trackers built into one rather than having to use several different apps.
"As others have mentioned, the new update has made it that the steps notification no longer displays on your lockscreen or under the notifications. It's as if it stopped working (I know the new updated turned this off under settings and turned it on) but even if I turned the notification on like it was before, it doesn't work despite I turned the setting on to display my steps. It also stopped detecting my steps, please fix this."
"When I travel in Auto/ Bus/ Bike, the app and watch4 continue to count the steps. And there is no way to reset the count of that particular hour or time period. There is no way to stop the step counting while traveling. In apple watch, if something suspicious is detected, the watch confirms from the user to count the steps or not. Same feature should be implemented in the samsung watch also."
the auto detect for working out was working just fine. I don't know if it's a network issue or update issue. But what I do know is my Samsung Galaxy 8+ and Samsung Gear S has been connected to track my steps. But what I'm having an issue with is my steps won't register until I turn my watch on. Steps aren't automatically tracking on my phone until then. It was working just fine up until few weeks ago. Today I worked out and nothing was tracked on my phone and my watch was turned on as well. Help
"The app is decent for being free but I think you should have the option to change the graph type, line graphs have a bigger impact on the brain having to clock on bars to see the min/max is a chore. Also you should be able to edit sleep times you have to delete it and manually add it without data if you want it correct."
"Good for something that comes with the watch and phone. Would be good if the running had option to keep you in certain heartrate zones rather than speed. Also the swim tracking is quite off, often detecting the wrong stroke. Would be good to at least fix them post swim."
"Historical Daily Activity just spins. This is just the most recent. Haven't been able to delete a sleep record, when it's actually me being lazy. No recent updates, I assume no app to work with my watch. Samsung's way of a forced upgrade? If you tell me to reach out to samsung, this post is just that."
"After the last update, the cycle tracking part of the app stopped working. I would enter my start date but it would continue to say ""period x days late"". I tried a lot of things, but eventually had to clear my data and reset the app before it was back to normal. And with the new data policy, none of my cycle history could be restored. I've loved using this app for a long time, but this was a very irritating situation"
"This is my go-to fitness app to track my workouts and walks. Lately, the app has not been tracking my walks accurately. The steps/distance/time are all fine, but the map is horribly wrong. My last walk, all that was displayed was a flag and appeared I didn't go anywhere. I'm bummed as this used to be a really good app for tracking my walks."
"Very irritating Whenever I workout I turn on my music but I can't listen peacefully because Each time I complete a kilometer I have a voice pausing and telling me I completed a mile, my average speed my total paces when I haven't finished my workout. It keeps coming up whenever I pause too. Very annoying. I can't even find sound settings off anywhere *Uninstall* Post script Couldn't find Audio off anywhere in the app. I touched all 3 dots where ever I found it and no audio off"
"After the last update, the app doesn't detect all my movements hence doesn't count all my steps but that's not the worst thing. My cycle tracking is all messed up! My period came three days early and I added that to my cycle, but it still says ""period starts in three days"". I deleted it and re-entered yet it still says the same thing. It's been four days now and it says ""period day two"". I sent multiple reports yet NONE are answered which shows very bad customer service. Please fix this asap."
"I can't even start it. It wants me to make a two step verification but it's not working. I put in my number but I'm not getting any code to verify. And when I try to skip the 2 step verification it has an error and doesn't load, which makes me start over again. Faulty from the start, not looking good and all I wanted was to track how long I'm running."
"It's a great app only if you engage with it, it doesn't automatically track your fitness, no prompts with notifications and the monthly step challenge is inaccurate. Example: the step challenge I lost with '32,672' steps was an actual '227,047' steps in the month of February. That's 194,375 uncounted steps."
It's ok. I want there to be more options for logging cardio activity. It seems like it only uses a preprogrammed calirie count for the activities. No options for intensity or manual entry of calories burned. It would also be nice if other common activities were an option. No fly machine. No seated row as opposed to a row machine. Etc.
"I use this app as a companion to the app on my galaxy watch 5. It suddenly dropped my calories burned during workouts dramatically. By about 50%. Also, any reason why spinning or ""indoor cycling"" is not an exercise option?! It's a very different activity from ""exercise bike."" Very glitchy syncing with MyFitnessPal. Overall mediocre compared with other fitness apps."
"I'm not sure why this has as low of a score as it does. This app is great. Best paired with a Samsung wearable. Gets rid of the annoying task of having a separate app for food/calorie tracking, such as my fitness pal. Everything is in one place! Fantastic. Highly recommend with a Samsung wearable. Currently using the Galaxy Watch 5 (which I also highly recommend) with this app."
"Overall happy with the app- although there are changes I'd want. The way to add your own workout data is cumbersome and the food tracker could be simplified (but with more options). I don't use the workouts on the app, but it syncs well with my watch. The only issue I have now is suddenly either the app is showing my data 5 hours ahead (I don't know if the app or watch is driving it but I can't figure out how to fix it)."
"Lowering it from 3 to 1. In addition to the removal of the heart and CO2 monitor, to increase sales on the watch. My previous review was about this issue as I cannot wear a watch being that I am autistic. They also require a 4 menstrual cycle to save data. Not all people have a normal cycle. Not only are they discriminating against people with sensory issues they are also discriminating against people with irregular menstrual cycles. This app just gets worse everytime I log in."
"Needs 2 move the options u choose (tired, unwell etc) 2 head of options like it used 2. Needs same selection options in the SPO2 measurement section as is offered in heart rate section (but especially resting). I'd like 2 be able 2 remove my sleep targets as being told I never meet something I didn't/don't want 2 set is having an incredibly negative effect on my mental health. I'd also like the ability 2 remove the step counter or add an option 4 electric wheelchair users 2 track distance."
Sleep tracking sucks. This is the second Samsung watch I've had and it tracks my total sleep but then won't give me the full details if my sleep is interrupted. It shows the total hours but won't show me the total information. Looks like I have to go back to fitbit immediately so I can get the details I need.
"I've been using the app with a Galaxy Watch 2, 3, and now a 5, all paired to a Samsung 3, 7, or S20+ phone. This last upgrade is a bit of a let down. Now, when I select Daily Activity, the day of the week selector just spins until you swipe right to the previous week and back again to the current week. Then the 2/1 date selector shows a spinning icon, but is selectable. I figured out that solution after the third restart."
Comprehensive but lacking one tiny feature. I really like the comprehensive nature of the app however when I add a custom exercise/workout it will not let me choose sets and reps as it does in for example the arm curls. Instead it only allows duration and calories.
"Can't use app without forking over friends & acquaintances information to your server. Terms & conditions state ""If you choose to sync contacts, your contact list is collected, and if any of your contacts is a Samsung Health user, that contact will automatically be added to your friends list."" but there's no choice. I spent a lot of $ on my Galaxy phone and Galaxy watch. I don't want to share my information with Samsung & I don't want to participate in ""Together"". I want to use my devices."
"Just downloaded this a week ago upon getting a Samsung galaxy watch. Have been working great until now. Where it shows your overall data, steps, calorie burn, etc. The calender for the week does not appear,just the spinning loading dots. Provide a fix"
It sucks alot of the time. I keep losing the total burned calories for the day. Or it doesn't count them at all. Then I have to go to the Verizon store to get it all to resink. That's getting really old. I pay for something that only works HALF THE TIME . I will not recommend this product to anyone
"I can not check my stress level or my heartbeat anymore. It would be nice if this could be fixed. I tried Uninstalling and stalling Samsung back in, but I still get the same results and can't check my pulse or heart, or stress level. Samsung Health has information from a year to three years ago. Nothing recent. Please fix"
Used to be a good app. Now after a update I don't see the steps on the lock screen and there is a constant notification icon on it. I have checked every setting and nothing that will show my steps without opening the app. Why can't you companies stop breaking things??
Does not work on Android. Does not allow Google login. The app hangs. Everywhere I look states that Samsung health apps only work on Galaxy phones. Edit to add: If Samsung truly cared about their sales and their apps then they would advertise how to get their watches to work on other phones. I already had this boxed up to return when Samsung replied or I may have tried what they said. I did not see anything about their reply in Samsung's own Support section.
Menstrual cycle no longer saves and that has been the main thing I use it for. It does not keep track of it or let me know upcoming cycle stages. I cannot comprehend why you would take away that feature. It's very helpful for doctors visits when you have medical issues. Very disappointed Samsung.
"Samsung Health is still not syncing with Health connect and writing data. Almost at the point of switched platforms all together as I need to use ""MY"" as I see fit within other connected applications. Ridiculous for one of the companies that made the feature is dragging their feet to make stuff work."
"Oh dear! I am glad I read up on this app before I bought. My present device is a lot cheaper and works very well with Samsung phone but doesn't have as many features. I will keep this under review in the hope they can debug, I am not going to do handstands just to get the steps etc accurate as mine is perfect but basic. Shame. Read up a bit. Present device claims 14 days between charges I get 10. This does 3.5. Really? (Apparently not really, some say 12 or 24 hours. Really really?)"
"I like the app! I mostly just use it to track my steps, it seems to be very accurate and I like the graphs it makes. However thr past week or so it has been glitching and not working at all. Hope they can fix it soon!!!"
"The main thing I was using this app for was tracking my weight loss post pregnancy, and this morning when I logged in it was gone. I received no warning and all the data is lost. I can't see any reason why a health app would drop this feature and I'm extra passed off because I didn't even get a chance to save my data elsewhere."
No idea what's up with the app lately but it's almost unusable. There is no consistency or reliability. Definitely not enough features for day to day tracking. Especially for those with disabilities.
I use this app alot as my daily tracker. While it doesn't always successfully detect when I go running I am usually able to add the basic detail of my run into the app to go towars my goals. This eveing I had 117min of activity recorded bedore going for a run. I did 44 minutes of running and I entered this into the app. For some inexplicable reason the app appears to fail basic maths that my 5 year old can do. 117 + 44 = 161 not 120 as the app suggests.
Not allowed me 2 skip 2-step verification. And instead of communicating it clearly it just broke down every time I tried to skip it. Ended up entering my damn password 8 times in a row ( cause copy paste it not allowed to). In other words sign in process is a PAIN
Update: Don't get a Samsung watch if you don't have a Samsung phone! it says on here this app will work on my phone but that is a lie and now I have wasted hundreds of dollars on something that isn't properly compatible. Original: Can't even sign in. I have a Samsung account and was able to set up using it with a different app last night but this one just refuses to let me in essentially making my watch useless for my intended purpose.
"Overall good but my frustrationn has been with Samsung Health interfacing properly with other health apps. With the intro of Google's Health Connect interface app, I thought my problems would be solved. Unfortunately, Samsung Health will not read or write data points to or from the Health Connect app. My Withings Health Mate app communicates beautifully with Health Connect, writing the data points that I want to it. But Samsung Health won't read or write to it. Very disappointing."
"My walking maps from my watch stopped posting to Samsung Health, and seemed to be connected to getting a new phone. I Googled, reset, redid permissions, no luck. Finally came here to find the phone number in their replies, and heard it's a known issue from the last update, and will be fixed, hopefully by the end of March. Wish I'd known, would have saved some time. I'll try to remember to check back and update this, one way or the other, by the end of the month. Usually I'd say 5 stars."
I have used this app for years and used to like it. But since changing phone to the Samsung s23 ultra the app I use to track my hydration and app for tracking sleep won't sync their data with it anymore. I've logged them in and out and re synced them and it's just not showing.
I've been a loyal Samsung user for many years but things like not being able to change the database of food products and a lack of product scanner have been really weighing heavy on me recently. It seems like Samsung's lagging behind and slows me down too.
"This is so inaccurate. I took my watch off for 3h. It recorded different patterns of sleep (light, deep, REM) when I was not even close to the watch, and not sleeping for sure. It takes out all the remaining credibility. Do NOT trust sleeping records."
"Used to be good. Now it's trash. Phone has built in optical sensor (note 20 ultra) that I payed for and that I used frequently in the past for heartrate and o2 stats and that is no longer a function without a trashy looking under featured ""smart"" watch."
"It is good, but please Samsung address these two: 1) missing feature to add additional power naps period (aside from night sleep) 2) when setting a target for weight loss, needs to accommodate by showing steps to take and exercises to take Upd: I have been Galaxy user since 2010 since Galaxy 1 era, so hopefully your development team will prioritise this minor yet critical suggestion. Thank you!"
Since they update the app I don't like it. It records my sleep wrong twice last week it was right. I suggest letting the person using it be able to type their sleep in and meals. I typed in my breakfast one morning and they delete it. Get the calories right and don't go by 10 things for breakfast. Everyone eats differently. Get my weight right I weight 140 pounds and I work out with weights at Planet fitness.
"App is ok but could be much better. Should add more graph options for data comparisons, like Daily calorie burns and daily calorie intakes all in one graph. Food entry should have bar code scanning. Other fitness apps have more functionality to help track goals."
"I'm fairly happy with the app. But sometimes the step counter will stop. Not sure if it is recalibrating distance or what. It does add some of the missed steps, that's why I'm wondering about calibration. My favorite is actually the SP‚Å∞¬≤ monitor as I have asthma."
"Hard to use. On the surface it looks similar to apple health. Once you use it though you realize you're hard it is to use, it doesn't sync steps with any other wearable, and overall is just really lacking as a fitness app"
"Semi good experience for tracking data from the watch and other manual entry data. The ONE MISSING bit is why Samsung does not include a weight entry tracker? Since a comprehensive health analysis cannot be relevant without knowing the weight of the person? There is a place to enter calories! etc... But no weight tracking? How to track historical BMI? How to tract calories burn without account for weight? It's worse knowing the older versions have it? Please Samsung, add back weight tracking!!!"
Only thing I wish they would add is a manual add steps. Use an honor system cause sometimes I walk without my phone and watch. ***Adding to my review. Its been 2 months and still waiting for them to have an add your own step feature. You can edit your own sleep time why can't you edit your steps. I may start looking for another app soon thats comparable with my watch. Lowered it to 3 stars.
Doesn't work with watch 5 for step tracking at all. I wear my fitbit and my steps are aprox 13k I wear my watch and it's 7k. I look online to see the problem and it's because I have a note 10 and the newer version of the samsung health app isn't compatible on my phone therefore the watch isn't correctly calculating my steps. So very upsetting.
"There is a problem with the step counter. It gets difficult to get a good gage on actual daily activity when both the app and the wearable device just rack up motion as a ""step"" registered. I seem to rack up ""hundreds"" of steps without causing motion. Would there be a way to calculate manually in order to maintain a strict log of our routines? I ask this as a sadly sedentary person due to severe injuries. I try to meet daily goals but the tracker records random motion w/o accuracy."
"Why do you make what was a good app worse with every update!!!! Stop please changing it. Everytime we update it, we can do less,and less. Please stop, & put it back the way it was before. What happend to being able to enter blood oxygen manually? Please let us be able to enter things manually again, & let us be able to enter the time, the calories, & the distance separately when doing a workout. The app was great before all these updates. Bring back the old versions with manual entry please."
"*Edit* - thank you very much for helping me, steps activation was rather awkward to find but glad it's back on! Terrible recently updates. No longer shows your steps on the pull down notifications bar. Really want to see this coming back."
"Sleep tracking isn't working properly anymore, not including auto detected records. The blood ox needs to be much better presented, how about a list of times it drops below 90% and the percentage it dropped too"
"Clunky to use interface. The ability to see daily caloric expenditure from previous days was a key features that was a positive, disappeared three days ago. Bring it back! Such a terrible app"
I love the app but the snarky tips on some of the features bother me. I don't need an app telling me why I can't sleep when it doesn't know why I'm not sleeping my regular schedule. Wish there was a way to dimiss some of the extra features when its not aware of the situation. Or at least a hey this is not normal do you want more info on a possibility of why.
"Samsung Intentionally Making It Worse Throughout each update it seems like samung strips a feature. Use to be able to see a graph for heart beat. Now it shows a hard to read min/high score. Use to be able to input work outs which I didn't without my phone. I cannot seem to find any button allowing me to do this so I'm assuming it has been removed. I'm sure I'm missing other things, but these are what I use to use and now I cannot. It's a shame my watch automatically syncs to this garbage."
"Good but lacking key features. I like this app especially alongside my gear pro 5 45mm watch, it is very accurate with hr tracking and steps etc etc. But I don't understand WHY IT DOESN'T HAVE A BARCODE SCANNER FOR FOOD TRACKING. Fitbit/MFP have one, but their systems are horribly inaccurate, while SH is pretty close to 95% accurate,BUT you have to manually search for any food/ meals you want to log? THAT IS JUST SO DUMB CONSIDERING IT'S 2023, if they add that I'll raise the stars"
"My steps aren't syncing from my watch. Everything else is, but not my steps!!! I have 8k steps by 10 AM on my watch and my phone (that stays in my truck when I'm at work) only has 1500 steps at 6 PM!!! I checked and it is set to sync from phone and watch in settings!! ü§¨ *Edit* The fix that was offered was what I already did if you took the time to read..........."
"This app is wonderful! I do wish that there was a way to track my measurements and see a summary of lost/gain since I track those more than Weight. Also, a way to scan barcodes when logging meals and foods. I currently have to use a separate app for each type of tracking."
"this app seems to work when it feels like working. I do the same 5 miles course daily and it clocks anywhere from 3.75 to 5.04. I don't think that you can trust what it is telling you. Also, it uses a lot of power, as it asks you to turn off power saver for better results."
The fact that I can't turn off the step counter is enough for me to give this 3 stars. The fact that it sends an unclearable notification about steps drops that to 1 star. I just want to see how far I've run without having unnecessary data forced on me. Make the app customizable and user friendly and its ratings will probably go up.
"I think it would be better if you add a feature that wakes you up after you get 8 hours of sleep, automatically, it detects your actual sleep by the watch, and once it sees that your body is now rested, the alarm goes off. Note: if anyone of you believe that this is worth adding then click ""yes,"" for it to be emphasised."
"No longer accurately counts my steps. Today, for example, my Garmin watch recorded 14629 steps, The app shows just over 11000. I cary it at work, so they should be close. Last weekend, it did not record any steps for the morning, which I did not notice until after my 2 mile run. It is hard to complete the fitness challenges and track my trends when it is so far off!"
"Fantastic app! One problem though, since the recent update, the app won't show properly on my settings. It's usually in never sleeping apps and now it's gone. All that's left of it is the app ""Health Platform,"" and its notification that ""Samsung Health has started."" Wish the developers could fix this bug soon!"
"Data for certain days in the past has been deleted entirely - e.g down from over 12,000 steps on 31 Dec to 39 steps. Over the course of the last 12 months I now, all of a sudden, have an incomplete and inaccurate record of steps. I assume the app has deleted retrospectively data. If Samsung Health cannot maintain simple historical data, then what is the point of anyone using it?"
"One trick pony down to zero. I only used this app for step tracking since Samsung opted to not include spO2 and heart rate sensors on my note 20 ultra like my note 9 had. Now I can't see my steps on the notification shade and lock screen anymore since updating, for no reason. Samsung is getting more pathetic by the day. Keep taking features away in apps and on devices, please, I'm already on my last Samsung device."
"Useless at this point. At first Samsung health was great in tracking my steps and I could visibly see my progress. Now I have to open the app, track it that way, and sometimes it's not accurate. Used to be great, now it's pretty awful. Edit: Nah, I'm not gonna contact you for something you jacked up. I've downloaded a much better health app instead. As the old saying goes ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it"", maybe y'all will consider that before fouling this app up further."
"I really liked this app for tracking my steps, and loved that it automatically detected workouts and seemed able to differentiate when I'm out and about from a exercising. As of 2 weeks ago none of these features are working anymore. What happened?!? Please fix this! Otherwise, a nonworking app is useless. Thank you."
Most of the time it won't detect my steps. Sometimes I'll pause it even though steps haven't been recorded and start again but that's not even working now. It's never worked well. I've only used it for steps. Oh. Oh when it was working it would stop for so no no reisn't if I paused it was all over.
"Great app loads of features on there a especially when linked with the Samsung's watch 4. I've changed my 5 star rating to 2 now, there's 2 feature's that the watch 4 that are not available just because I don't have a Samsung phone, blood pressure and ECG? I've spent a lot of money on this watch and not to get these features is pretty poor really, it about time this changes or I may have to switch to Google watch. The app is still amazing but the lack of some features on watch is poor"
"Steps are somewhat accurate, calories burned are quite a bit off. It feels like they artificially inflate progress just to make you feel good/keep you coming back. Monthly challenges seem to be won by cheaters or bots, or somehow people are running 2 marathons a day every day. The mining of non health related data is extremely heavy. Could be worse, but could also be MUCH better."
With my galaxy S10 I could monitor my heartrate and stress level which was perfect for me since I have issues with those due to illness. Now with the galaxy S22 this is suddenly no longer available. I guess I can only use it for steps and period tracking now. Pretty useless in other words.
"Have used this app for quite a while and was always happy with it. However, have just upgraded my phone to A53 and cannot seem to take any heart rate etc - no option for me to switch on, app is updated and would be extremely disappointed if this option has been removed......"
"Please bring back ""skip login"" option. This app will not log in I've tried multiple versions of the app and till won't work. Only version I can use and get into is a build from 2020 which has the skip login option but my watch will not sync to it as the app was too old. Unusable."
"Recent update and policies acknowledgement has resulted in my app not working; I get an error. Prior to that, the app was sufficient. I generally used it to record and track workouts. I'll likely go back to previously used workout apps if not resolved very soon."
"This app is brilliant! It helps me keep a track of everything. It suggests and provides wonderful content for meditation, sleep, stress relief, exercise. It's just one stop for all your needs of your body. One must just know how to use it correctly. Very very happy with this app."
Won't automatically detect workouts. I have reset and reset the app. I have chose other workout option. I have reset to the manuals guide on phone and watch. I know I can start workout manually. But the whole reason I bought Samsung galaxy watch 5 was to link to phone and have auto start. Waste of money and time. Super frustrating. Lynne Rogers
My birthday showed up wrong so I uninstalled the app and reinstalled it thinking it was glitched and now my birthday is off by months and years with no way to change it. (My birthday is correct on my Samsung account but it's different in the Samsung health app.) I haven't even used the app yet and already off to a horrible start. I don't know if my age plays a part in health calculations so it being off worries me.
"I've just swapped phones and now I can't find the simplest of items in the food bit. My regular UK supermarket food has diminished quite considerably e.g morrisons, asda etc....where have they all gone. Having to add a lot of custom meals. On the plus side the custom meals and regular meals have transferred fine"
"The update to the app on February 1 2023 caused the steps tracker to become stuck in ""location detection has restarted"". I've tried turning off and restarting, however it didn't fix the issue. The app has worked flawlessly since I purchased my s22 ultra in March 2022."
I was loving how well this was tracking and syncing my health data but it will NOT let me take my blood pressure from my watch. I have a galaxy 5 and my galaxy phone is on the list of phones. I have emailed Samsung and about a week ago I even chatted with them. They said my watch needed an update and they would push it out in 1 to 3 days.. nothing and still not working. Feb 18 and still no update and no help from Samsung or the app.
"Works appallingly on Oppo find x5 Pro. On known routes the distance is reported to be around 50pc of the actual..and the step count around the same ratio when compared to 2 other devices and apps. Worked well on my s7, but seriously sucks on the new device in comparison to other apps."
Hate It Like It Hate It Again. Last update screwed up scale on Body Composition. It looks like a flat line unless you lose 25% of your body weight. Less annoying is 31 days is not same as 31 data points. I can live with that but fix the scale for Body Composition over time.
The sleep feature is a joke. I can be sitting at my computer and this app saves that time as a sleep session. There does not seem to be a way to even manually fix it. Pretty basic function that does not function...
"There is a bug that won't let anyone edit there sleep record. The option to edit is there, but when you enter the edit mode you're unable to make any changes. Please fix. I should be able to delete time segments where I was not actually sleeping, like I used to be able to."
My earliest Samsung Health records are from 2017 and I've been using it since before then. Samsung does not make a chest-strap heart-rate-monitor (I wish they did) and I do not want a smart watch. Today the app let me pair it with my Wahoo Tickr X (It was not easy and I swear it was not available yesterday when I wrote this review.) I will update the review once I've re-tested the app (I remember how great it used to be).
"What happened to blood pressure? I used to manually record it and loved the export feature. So, now I need yet another app? Also, if like to be able to edit my sleep times. If i take my watch of for a few minutes after I wake up, it records that time as sleeping."
"Many things to like; however, please allow challenges to be set at greater time spans than a few weeks. Would be nice to create a yearly challenge with friends. Long term goals üëå thanks for all the perks so far!"
"This should be more aimed at dev contact, I suppose, but I'll put it here anyway. I'm a Health Connect Beta. Why is it that the most common metric people use for tracking health (steps) isn't an option for SH to write to HC? Fit can read and write steps to HC, but SH can't. Why? I bought a Samsung wearable because Fit didn't track steps accurately, and SH tracked steps better. We are supposed to be able to choose which direction the data flows in our data merge."
Not the worst but not great. I can no longer edit sleep data when the watch thinks I'm sleeping if I'm sitting watching a movie. The app syncs with my galaxy 4 classic but shows old information on my body composition on the home screen.
"No matter how still , stop breathing , completely frozen you get, it does not read anything just "" make sure finger is on sensor"" .... Updated even worse. No Samsung it's not a dirty lens on meter either, just another fantasy non working app.,. There are apps that work though..."
"Period Tracker doesn't work anymore. I enter my period, delete it, and re-enter several times and the app continues to say it's late. Used to work. Maybe roll back to a previous update when that AND other features worked well..."
"Welp, whatever you geniuses did to this app it no longer syncs with my watch or registers my steps on my phone or watch. If anyone is thinking of buying Samüí© products, don't bother. They do not fix the problems THEY CREATE. I've tried EVERY single troubleshooting suggestion to fix this problem and none of them have worked! I'm going to buy Apple products from now on & throw my samüí© phone and watch in the trash where they belong. Thanks for NOTHING!!!"
"Edit: don't understand your reply? Im not on about step counter. I get two PERMANENT notifications on about snoring restarted (when I'm out and middle of the day) and every hour ""Samsung health started"" which stays 30 min. Review: Getting worse! Now constantly getting ""snore detection restarted"" and ""samsung health started"" 600 times a day EVEN THOUGH SNORING DETECTION IS OFF and my phone isn't even on charge so it should NEVER be starting. Why does this app seem to get worse every update?"
"I had initially gave this app 4 stars in 2017. Now, I give it two. It looks like this app is leaning towards smart devices. In some cases they aren't allowing manual input of data, such as the Oxygen sensor."
"Its goshdarn horrible! It has no option to train it so that it will reject var,motorcycle, and commute bumps as steps. The result is that it overestimates the total steps per fay. Other fitness tracker have this behavior tagging feature. I use it with galaxy watch 4. For being called a smartwatch this is definitely ironic because it is very dump. Add feature for behavior tagging Copy the feature from xiaomi fitness band and Amazfit watches with behavior tagging."
"After this last update, this app keeps starting and stopping on its own. This happens several times a day. I have not been able to track my daily activity for several days. Just figured it out. When you change how an app works, let the user know. Don't just assume they know what you did."
"*02/2023*: 4 years went by, and there's still no way to set a weekly/monthly/yearly step/km goal or see totals. *03/2019*: Step counter & activity tracker featured prominently here, but I can't even see total steps/miles/kilometers I made in a week or a month. Just ""averages"" that aren't doing me any good. If I'm set on a goal of walking 300 000 steps or 200 kilometers this month, there's no way to track progress. Please add weekly/monthly/yearly goals for steps/distance, and let us see totals."
"Was a brilliant app until now, now I can't use the heart rate, oxygen etc unless I connect to a smart watch. I'm in the late 40's and definitely don't use smart watches. Extremely disappointed as this was once a brilliant app to use."
I love this app and it works really well with my watch. Although lots of sections don't work as well with a screen reader or if your text is a larger size so not the most accessible. Would be amazing to get weighted hula hooping added to the list of exercises especially as it's becoming a big trend on tiktok. Might encourage more people to use it if they knew they could track it accurately
App is ok.....the issue is the search function.... absolutely brutal. Search for cheddar cheese it brings up rigatoni.....type the exact name of the product brings up a list of completely unrelated foods. Also the saved items is very random
"App keeps crashing after Feb 8, 23 update. No place to send feedback in the app, so you get it here. Really annoying persistent notification saying I need to sign in, but when I try, the app freezes. What garbage."
All sorted now thank you. üòä
"A nice application, but every time it stops sending notifications about some of the features of the application, recently it stopped calculating the number of steps, every time it sends me a message, the feature has stopped like this, what did you leave, only a formal application that is empty from within üò§"
"I used to love this app, but gets worse with every update. Now I am forced to link to my phone number to use an optional feature I won't even use, so I try to put in my phone number for the mandatory two-step verification, but it glitches and keeps going back to the verification screen, even after I put the code in multiple times. I've restarted the app, deleted and re-downloaded, cleared the cache, nothing works. The app is now totally useless because of stupid, pointless, glitchy verification."
Previously had quite a lot of trouble with Strava. I asked for support and I was told to call some international number to help guide the fix but I rejected to pay per minute. Now it finally seems to work though I occasionally miss tracking for some workout.
"After the latest update yesterday, the app has stopped counting steps on auto detect basis . Yesterday it showed zero steps for the whole day and today even after manually starting the app, it shows only 1776 steps after a walk of 42 minutes covering around 4 km. Kindly help with a resolution . The version now is 6.23.0.063"
"I couldn't login in the app using a non-Galaxy phone. Developer responded with the solution of using Samsung's browser and it solved. I hope this is fixed in the future for other users, but my main issue was solved. Other than that, it is a very good app! 4-stars for the headache/login issue."
"This app is easy to use and has a very clean and simple user interface. One of the best companion app for daily activities, everything is being shown clearly and easy to understand. Galaxy Watch 4 are working flawlessly with this app and I'm super impressed with it."
"Can't seem to get the app in my watch synced, my watch says that I step 7704 steps but the app says that I've only done 446 steps. This is the fourth day it has been doing this... I've tried to refresh the app, close the app, and have restarted my phone nothing is correcting this..."
"Since the most recent update, I can no longer see my total calories burned for previous days! I can only see my ""activity calories burned"". This makes this watch useless. Really regretting not sticking with garmin. Fix it! Prior to the update, if you clicked back on your daily activity calendar you could see total steps, active minutes and active calories as well as total calories burned for the day (including your bmr not just workout ""active"" calories)."
"I am in a step challenge and I sync the health app to the challenge where it records our steps and so on Sunday 3/12/23, it just stopped and so my dta which is on the app did not synch and even though I dumped the app several times to try to get it reboot. It never did until Monday 3/14/23 midday, it just started syncing but it did not sync the 3/12 records and as yet to do so. I needed to get this on my record as I am in a step challenge and I am in 1st place, but now I am in 4th place."
"This app never only synce strave to it, not it to strava, so habe to manually share, means I stick to garmin for most stuff... sync properly to strava the only thing I really want it to do.. And it also logs me out of strava sync, at least every other week.. Very frustrating..."
"Switched to a new phone, can't even login now. It redirects me to the login page, I login and then suddenly glitches. Tried everything, clearing cache, deleting data etc. Nothing works, can't even use my Galaxy watch 4 classic now."
"Great app overall. The experience is worth if you have a Samsung Galaxy watch to pair it with. The functionalities are great. I wish there was a better interface to track food, and the options are limited. Also, there is no way to challenge friend in different sports... or any sports! You can only send a challenge for step count or distance covered. For swimmers or hockey players this is quite frustrating. All disciplines should be available and the group of friend gets the notification."
I was trying to get shealth to work with google health connect and Everything seems to sync fine except my heart rate. It shows up in the shealth app from my watch but dosent get sent to health connect. Everything else seems to work as expected.
"I basically only use my watch for time and step counting. I'm not always on my feet for work and it is averaging me 70k steps each day. It is really frustrating. Step counter is not working at all. I average about 5-7k steps each day. Not 70-90k steps. It's absurd. Edit: it's been a week or so, the step counter isn't crazy anymore. Prays it stays that way."
Worthless for tracking calories burned running. It will vary from 25-125 calories per mile even at the same pace and route that I run daily. Decent food library. App is worse with every update and help is always settings/clear cache/force stop.
It was all going so well until this month's period tracker. It used to allow me to record the days of my period which is important when it is earlier than the predicted pattern and then it would calculate the next predicted ovulation and the next period but it's not recalculating anymore. It's still working off its predictions. This is annoying and it's no longer accurate for me.
I would not purchase a samsung watch again or this app. The whole point was to track my sleep accurately and it can't do that. You can't edit the sleep records. It uses your overall time rather than your actual sleep time. I wish you could actually look at the time you were in rem and awake rather than just a tiny graph. The whole thing seems very inaccurate. Don't waste your money.
"Phone permission is not at all required ! ! Not sure why Samsung has mandated to allow manage phone & calls, which is clearly breach of user privacy. One must be able to use the watch only for health monitoring and there's no good reason at all to get your phone permissions, etc."
"Reporting much less sleep the last 2 nights than I actually had. Almost 3.5 hours last night and about 2.5 the previous night. Also, very large gaps between heart rate readings, sometimes as much as 3 hours. üòï Never got a notification that someone replied to my review! In looking at other reviews, why should we have to call you? Fix the problem! PLEASE! If I need to make changes, email me! Poor customer service."
"I quite like the app. There's a lot it tracks which is great however my two gripes are that I can't limit food to just Australia. We don't have every US/UK/EU product here & the names use US or UK english names, it is never both only either. Please, everything else is in metric except food. Australia uses metric, KJ not kcal. Please update this. It is so confusing having to do math to know where I'm at or what to achieve."
"Excellent App... Very useful for tracking health targets... PLEASE ADD ONE FEATURE : CURRENTLY USER CAN NOT GENERATE OR EXPORT PDF REPORT OF BODY COMPOSITION DATA - just like blood pressure data. If developer add this option, it will be very useful. Currently user can export blood pressure data and generate a pdf report - this is excellent and very useful feature. I am requesting you to developer to PLEASE ADD SAME FEATURE FOR BODY COMPOSITION ALSO. (I am using Samsung Note 9 with Samsung Watch)"
"Why is it necessary to turn on alarms and reminders in order for this app to count steps???? I HATE it that the app scolds me for not moving enough - hey, I have mobility problems and do NOT need to be reminded of them. I just want to know how far I have walked. I do NOT want to be told I have been inactive for ""too long""! But I can't count steps if I do not enable this nonsense. I HATE THIS APP!"
"Ever since update, the app stops recording my progress biking. Restarted the app rode at least 5 more miles and it didn't record at all. I have used this app for over two years with no issues, now it stinks. Going to another app."
"App randomly restarts and gives a ""Samsung Health Starting"" notification then my phone freezes and I need to do a hard restart. It's extremely annoying. I'd get rid of the app if I didn't have a Samsung watch."
Update 3/23. Still bad. No feedback area in the app. People need to know what their heart rate was AND for how long. Not just the highest and lowest for the day! Make an easy to see report that shows how long your heart rate was for each day/week so that we can compare it to AMA recommendations. You have the data. Save yourself the trouble and just download another fitness app like Myfitnesspal or something.
"What is with the latest changes? And so many compliments I agree with. How about Samsung just fix the latest issues, by taking a step back. I've had to ad a widget to my home screen to see my steps."
"Down hill after changing phones. I can no longer access heart rate, stress levels and others. Went from a samsung 8 to a ultra 22. Used to love this app now its pretty useless. And no I'm not contacting you to spend hours on the phone to have no results"
Every update for the past year and a half has been making this app worse and now you removed the better looking widgets from the home screen. You guys just changed the widget again and it's even worse looking than the previous two iterations.
"Since the latest update it continually disconnects from my phone it doesn't show my steps it doesn't show the workout same thing as Thomas put in. please stop doing your updates I am so tired of it disconnecting from my phone and right now I still can't get it to connect to my phone this time. This is my third or fourth watch first one went crazy, second one I was electrocuted from because the back came off third one went wacky and again I got zapped and this one well It now seems to be trash"
"Great application! I love the coach feature for running and working out so much! Helps me stay focused and motivated to reach specific goals health wise. Gives great advise and motivational speech with minimum interruption, and allows me to listen to music from within the app as I workout. Overall, a great application for anyone trying to get fit and healthy at home."
"Pretty disappointed that you can't edit your workout after the end (for example when you forget to stop the workout) and most of all integration with Health Connect is very bad to none. Can't even sync the number of steps. Bought months ago a Galaxy Watch 5, coming from 4 years in the Garmin environment i can say that Garmin has more options and features regarding trainings."
"Updated to 4 stars its working again! It's a great way to track your health. Keeps crashing, won't open. I un-installed and reinstalled, will not open. Keeps saying server error."
"I can't share a map with the route of my exercise, at the last update this option disappear. The share options became terrible, show the same image for all kind of exercises."
App is good but suddenly I'm getting bombarded daily with notifications that the app restarted or location detection restarted. I can't figure out how to turn off these specific notifications and they are annoying.
Lap recording on my watch 4 and now my watch 5 are seriously messed up. Recording laps every couple of seconds instead of every mile like I have it set on the watch. Very disappointing considering I just bought this watch for exercise and it won't even do that without annoying me to death.
No longer works. The app gets progressively worse with every update. The galaxy watch also gets worse with each update as samsung tries their best to make it feel slow after about 6 months - a year. They make both the app and the watch itself feel slow as soon as they realistically can to pressure users into upgrading each year. But I say that you should not buy a galaxy watch in the first place if you're looking for longevity.
"Pretty bad. Feels like they're just collecting my data and not really providing me a service. No real easy way to see my full history, barely any graphs, no way to check my progress. Avoid this app if possible."
"I don't have the watch but my Moto tracks the info well enough. The other data I enter manually. This is the most comprehensive tracker I've come across. I link it with my Google fit to enter my temp, BP, respiratory rate etc. I'm diabetic and it's easy to pull up to show my doctor. If I could improve anything I'd say add the info for vitals and calories burned into this app."
Latest update has a persistent notification about the app running in the background that can't be cleared unless you disable all notifications for the app. Now it is useless for me.
"Limits imposed if using non-Samsung device. Samsung health monitor app (not this app) is not allowed on non-Samsung phones apparently. Can't download the app to use ECG or BP functions on G Watch 5. I wish Samsung would be more open & make this known. I like their wearables but not their phones. Ever since my S5 with their own apps in addition to Google, like calendar, photos, and messages apps taking up memory that made the phone unusable. Except for this, there Samsung health app works fine."
"31Jan20: Samsung health updated adding snore detection and oxygen levels while you sleep but doesn't allow you to use the updates on gear S3, only galaxy watch4!!! STII CANNOT EDIT SLEEP TIMES!!! 6Jan23 you can not edit sleep time neither increase nor decrease. 26July2021 This app is not accurate. It doesn't pick up times you're up at night or for how long. I was up for 2hrs 40min in the early morning and the app says I slept straight through!"
It has been wonderful till this latest update. It won't keep track of my women's health and keeps deleting it as well as when I wake up in the morning to check out my total health and calories burned for the previous day it won't ever show me frustration to know or not if I made my goals when I can't look back.
"The only thing that i have a highly major problem with is the food section of the app, when youre putting in what you ate. Most of whats in there already is not right as in the nutritional info. Example: 1/4lb burger has roughly 1.8mil of iron... but the app says it has ZERO. That is a problem if ur not careful. I had to punch in ALOT of the foods i eat cause the app gets them all wrong!"
Why limit features and make them mostly useless? My watch tracks oxygen levels yet the app only shows it for sleep. Even then it's hidden in a subheading and barely readable. I need constant tracking with a drop alarm.
"Update: please make a Medical record section to be able to get to any doctor and just share with an QR. Done filling up those paper, plus you have plenty of info on our health already. Thanks Great app to follow your work out specially I used for bycicle riding. Yet had to switch to strava to allow tracking of segments and friends. Now strava does not have that in the free version. Great time to go ahead and win big market share for you if you fit that need."
"All of a sudden my app has stopped mapping my steps & I don't know how to get it back. The app has access to my location, this was 1 of the main reasons I got the watch. Stop changing things that are not broken!"
"Can't read steps from any other devices and has very inaccurate step tracking otherwise. Really quite the oversight, and the perfect reason not to use this app for tracking your total health data. Very poorly designed"
"It is messing my data, even when i turned off/on it always count unnecessory data like - bike riding , auto and bus riding. So i can't get actually how much i walked. Eg- One day it counted 14000 steps, in which bike, auto, car, even may be metro was included."
"Samsung Health is an excellent app for health and fitness tracking. However, it would be even better if it included a food tracking bar scanner for easier and more accurate meal tracking."
"I just opened phone for heart rate. Samsung Health wants me to sign into account to use. They can't find my name, phone number, email. Password reset doesn't work cause it says it can't find me. But I have had this Samsung phone for 5 years and Samsung health for 15 years with 2 Samsung phones before. What the heck is wrong with your system? If you try to sign in with Google account, you have to agree to give Samsung more information than my family doctor has on me. What the HECK?"
"Latest update made it stop tracking my movement on my watch. Essentially useless now. Hopefully, Samsung will fix it. Update: the issue seems to have fixed itself after several hours."
"This app is absolutely unreliable. All I want is to track steps and activity. Ive been doing yardwork for 2 hours now with so may trips to the alley garbage can and though my phone was on me, it tracked zero steps or activity. Huge bummer, deleting this app again cause im sick of dealing with disappointment."
"I've been using Samsung Health for while but I noticed that you can't personalize a full 4.4.4.4 breathing patterns on the app and It doesn't have fasting tracker imagine if it have it all, That would be better you know . Try also to do partnership with apps like Balance ( meditation ) and Fitify ( full body training )"
"Recently, when I updated the app, I cannot sign in to my Samsung Account as when I signed in with correct email and password, it showed ""Process Failed"". Even sign with Google Account still failed. Please help fix the app."
"This is a really simple app üòä . What I will say is that if you're an idiot like me, and you press ""accept"" to notifications, you will get over 3 notifications a day saying: ""Good morning! you have done 6,432 steps today. Keep it up to reach 10,000! üí™"" That is my only complaint, overall 4 stars. simple, easy üëåüèªüòå. Thank you for reading this message to the end üíñ . have a nice day üòÅ ."
"This is a DUMB app compared to Apple Health app. Example, do a pushup workout on this app, it starts a stop watch but has no way to track how many pushups you did = DUMB! Going back to the iPhone for my next upgrade."
Dont let Samsung Health update to the version pushed at the end of February 2023 (One UI 5.1). The sleep tracking function will stop working in any useful way. Reinstalling will simply erase ALL info. Worst update on any device I have ever seen. I'd give negative stars if possible. All features will work as usual the day before this update. The next day you will waste hours trying to sort out th he chaos.
"Really like the watch just hope you figure out a way to make battery last longer, even put battery save mode on but still gotta charge it every other day. Got frustrated with fibit so I switch & glad I did. There battery lasts a week hoping Samsung will do the same."
"Doesn't import Health Connect data... Reply to Samsung... I tried contacting Samsung support, there's no way pathway for them to help me with the app as they only help with phones and wearables and for some reason not the apps that run on them."
Was a great app I used daily for years. Now they require a phone number to send notifications to your contacts about your activity. I don't want to interact with other people in a fitness app. Remove this.
"Can be so good but lacks lots of features For example i wish the running program could be modified during the program. If a workout is too easy and I'm 2 weeks or even more advanced I still need to do walking instead running what make me drop the workout. Doesn't make any sense. This is one example of things that are just ""not there"" yet.. If it was open source I would javelin spend time adding those features.. just easy an necessary things to add."
"I have to enable tw factor authentication to use it. I already lost my LAST Samsung account to their stupid two factor system. Edit: two factor authentication should be optional, I shouldn't have to give a rep all of my information correctly, only for my account request to be denied because I don't have access to an old product of yours."
"Update: Tried it again next year, everything works now. Doesn't work on phone. Blocks me from accessing app because it wants me to set up two-factor authentication. I set it up, then it immediately asks me again. Can't use app as a result. Pretty stupid."
"It's fine for just an overall recording, but if you want to download data, fat chance. I only use it because it's free, otherwise I'd turn it off all together and used something else that is actually useful"
"Good app to help track number of steps achieved for the day. Great to be able to review how I did yesterday vs this time last week. I do receive a notification however, that the Weekly Summary is available for review - however, consistently being prompted that no data is available for this.. Please rectify.."
"I've recently changed my phone from a Samsung S9 to a S20. The app opens but I'm unable to check stress levels or heart rate. Can't find a way to rectify this üòï Scrap that comment, I've just read that this phone doesn't support Heart Rate Sensor........"
"Worse than useless. Just more Sansung bloatware that fails to record data reliably. Uninstalling and will find a superior app to track fitness data. Sorry Samsung, you blew it."
Could Be So Much Better. This app is missing some basic features such as entering meals a head of time and creating custom meals ahead of time (something that would be great for meal prep).
"Calorie burnt measurement is out of sync with activity. Up until late January 2023, to burn 100 calories would require approx. 20 minutes of activity. Since late Jan, when I do 100mins of activity including over 10,000 steps, calories burnt are shown as approximately 350. Been using this app for 4yrs every day, so I know when something is not working as before."
Since 1/25 my step count has stopped working. I clear cache and then have to clear data. It will work for an hour or so then it stops working again. Everything is up to date.
"Use this app multiple times a day. Not only does it track my steps/distance I've walked, I track my sleep patterns, blood pressure,food intake etc. It also has great workouts to choose from and free."
The experience is generally good. Now the water tracking is glitching and the numbers don't reflect the actual consumption.
Not bad. I like being able to track my sleep info but it only shows a breakdown of your most recent sleep period. I tend to wake up about 2 hours early to use the restroom and go back to bed so I only get a breakdown of a couple hours instead of the bulk of my sleep.
"Help needed. I've been using this app for years and following a recent illness am using it multiple times a day and it's been fine. Today unable to update my weight which I need to do. It's allowing me to record, but then isn't showing/saving anything passed 28 Oct. Please help! Ive cleared the cache, there's no update required and I've rebooted my phone, same issue. Also I can't lose my data so don't want to uninstall and reinstall just to see if that helps. I have data I need to track."
"Latest update has essentially made this app unusable unless you permit access to your contacts and setup 2FA with samsung... if the Samsung phones are downgraded to just making phone calls unless you forego your privacy, why would I spend $1200+ for the functionality of a flip-phone Re: I don't want to use the ""together"" feature. Why is the app use contingent on that. If I dont want to be part of samsung gathering everyone's health data, which is protected information by law, why am I forced"
Smart app that is so dumb! I just got the Samsung watch 5 and I can't even use this stupid app because it is pre-loading with a very old phone number (one that was never even registered to this device or this phone plan!) and I don't have the option to update it! WHAT THE HELL?!?! I can't even get past the registration?!?!? I bought this watch for many reasons and 90% of them are off the damn table since this stupid app won't work! UGH!!! Can someone please fix this A.S.A.P. üò´
"Hi Team, I unlocked samsung a50 bootloader and flashed different OS and after some research I installed samsung original firmware version back and locked bootloader. But now Samsung health app is not working and it is showing authorization error. Can you provide the steps how I can get this app working with my old health data. Thanks in Advance!"
Too many inconsistencies with step counter vs daily activity. Would like to see more consistent tracking of steps and ability to download data into .csv file or to send gathered data to a medical professional. Otherwise I enjoy using the app.
"Bruh, cannot even login on Xiaomi device... I am already used to it, that it takes long to load the Samsung account on other apps too. (e.g. Galaxy Wearable etc.) But this app says that the login session has expired but the interface won't load even after 10 minutes..."
My phone keeps on disconnecting from the watch. My phone keeps on buzzing with a notification on my phone. The buzzing is almost constant. Very unhappy as update didn't stop the buzzing.
My watch faces no longer show my heart rate... I bought and downloaded several watch faces that used to track my heart rate during the day... After the last update most of those watch faces don't show my heart rate any longer... I used to love this app but now I'm getting so I'd rather not use it.. put my heart rate back on my watch faces... This work perfectly before people started messing with it
This app stopped working and counting my steps suddenly. I tried to do many things through the settings but nothing worked out to bring it back to work as it was before. I am thinking of uninstall it.
"Instead of an in-app login menu, the app opens Google Chrome, even if that's not set as your default browser. Don't support this kind of asinine browser lock-in. Then the app requires the Phone permission (and thus reads your phone number) even though the described use case very obviously fits what should be an optional permission. Then you're also forced to setup SMS 2FA, the worst of all 2FA methods. And then you can't copy the 2FA backup codes out of the app..."
Don't use. It requires access to make and manage your phone calls! What a joke. Also don't purchase the Samsung watchs. It doesn't natively work with Google Fit. You have to use samsung health. I wish I knew that before I purchased one.
"The sleep notifications on my watch are inconsistent, unwanted, and annoying. The only way to stop them is to disable all notifications, terrible."
It was really good. But now I can't play the music to help me fall asleep. I was also wabting to use the exercise challenges as well. Where did they go?????The exercise part is saying no items. Why is that????
I gave this app a poor review a year ago but just purchased a Samsung watch and tried it again. The app has been improved but has a surprising failure. The food tracking function does not provide for scanning bar codes. This is such a basic function with most calorie apps and a huge help I cannot explain why it's been excluded.
"It is a nice app but having issues in steps recording it gets hung sometimes, but If I use youtube videos( not in music mode) or watch netflix videos while walking steps are not monitored it starts recording only after the video is stopped/closed"
"I liked using the app when it worked in conjunction with more apps, but it has dropped a ton on value now it that it no longer accepts data from Fitbit and My Fitness Pal. I've grudgingly gone back to Google Fit."
"UPDATE: apkmirror Samsung Health 6.21.3.001 and the android intent will PROPERLY call the WebView, ALLOWING LOG IN. Then update app. --- I can't sign in to my Samsung account using the SAMSUNG BROWSER??? I just switched phones and now I can't even sign on to sync all of my data back to my watch?? Frickin Google/Samsung and their Frankenstein watch OS."
"01MAR21: Growing wrong direction. 09OCT22: Didn't listen. App is worse. Sleep data shifts when trying to record now with latest update. Just garbage. 20JAN23: The latest issue is the algorithm for determining calories burned - just junk. I've noticed my calories burned is inaccurate. Just from walking a mile or so, I lose 30-40+ cal burned as soon as I hit Finish. App doesn't match exercise equip cal burned by even more. 01FEB23: After update, Calories burned even lower. Worst health app ever!!!"
I like the app in general. I would be great to have an option to choose manually light or dark mode. I have an older device and not able to switch the app to dark mode (the wiget as well). Could you add this setting?
"It worked perfectly fine until up until latest update. Now has signing error, server error and something about Samsung season expired. I somehow managed to get the app working again. I had to go to app settings, clear storage, restart phone and lost all my results. Besides that works fine has a lot of good information on there."
"I can't see my steps anymore on my phone unless I fully go into the app. Used to be able to just pull down from the top on my main phone screen and the steps would be there. Now it just says ""Samsung Health Started"". Don't care for that update."
"Samsung Health I'm very pleased overall with my experience with your app. However, I'd rate 5-star if you could integrate Cronometer with your app so nutrition data will show up in Samsung Health. I previously had MyFitness Pal and it did show its nutrition data in Samsung Health. Can you please integrate Cronometer as well. Thanks Developers"
"Don't bother with global contests. The app is full of hackers who boost their numbers for no other reason than to dishearten people who are actually on the path to healthier living. Apparently people can step 8k steps an hour for 36 hours straight, and the app seems to think that's totally normal. No way to tell how many people at the top of the ladder have just made a few clicks to get there vs the people who walk for hours a day in the spirit of the competition. Do better Samsung."
"Really, Samsung? It's incredible how many people are buying your Samsung 5 Pro watch. Why not expand the compatibility of the Samsung Health Monitor app to all smartphones? To enable the ECG, open the Samsung Health Monitor app on all Android devices. I have a Pixel 6 device. No need to call pls make th app available for U. S users on Pixel phones. Again you have a great watch. Making this app available to all Android users and not just Samsung devices would be appreciated"
"Awesome app and it's totally free! I tried previous similar apps in the past, but u always have to pay, so no more. I love this simple app. Only question I have is what is workout trainer, if I wanted to complete the full version of a workout?"
"The latest update brings a big improvement that made the battery drains insanely! 15% and all are consumed actively not in the background. I tried many things in an attempt to fix it but nothing worked; disabled auto detect workout, steps from watch only, clear data and cache, reinstall. Nothing had worked at all!"
The sensors i.e. HR and pulse ox cannot seem to record even in perfectly still conditions. I.e they are less reliable since the latest upgrade. Stair counting was poor. Worse now. Hope these can be fixed. Upgraded or perhaps just switched to a 5. Equally unreliable. Strap is the only improvement so far.
"Such a pain to scroll across to the amount of grams/kals instead of being able to just type it in, when you type in the food you are eating it limits your options, it's put me off using this app, wouldn't recommend it"
"How to remove friends on friends list Im not going to block anybody I want to remove them from my friend list without blocking If there is no such option in this application then Samsung health should work on this and give a new option so that we can easily remove anyone from our friend list I liked the rest of the application very much, this is the only thing I am missing"
"I have been using Samsung Health for quite a while now and have a lot of recorded information. I recently got a Honor Magic4 Lite ANY-NX1. I have downloaded Samsung Health as i want to still use it, however the app does not record steps accurately. Yet other people I know with the same model of phone have no issues. Please advise?"
Actually really like the app itself. But I use Nutracheck to track nutrition and Samsung have blocked other apps from linking to their activity tracker. Not sure if this is so that people are forced to use Samsung health for everything. But pretty annoyed that I forked out hundreds for a Samsung watch and it doesn't have this basic feature. Nutracheck have confirmed they're keen to integrate but Samsung won't allow it. Back to my fitbit!
"The latest revision is aweful! I get a constant notification on my S22 Samsung Health app and can't clear. Where my step count used to display, it just says ""Samsung Health Started"". They really messed up the app with this update!!!"
"Has been a great app for biking the last 3 years. Always tracked exactly with watch. Today quit working during middle of ride. When I stopped, it updated miles and was 7 miles short of overall distance."
"I've tried three times to set up an account, it's so unnecessarily difficult to even log in or create an account with Samsung. I have a Samsung watch connected to my Google pixel phone and that works fine, but some of the apps on my watch need me to create a Samsung account if I want to use them. I've tried multiple times and it's not working. I cannot get past two-step verification. I've set up two-step verification four times now, the first three times it didn't work. This is a waste of time."
"Thought I'd give this one another go.. Still as rubbish as it was 3 years ago when I gave up on it. It's absolutely incredible to me that the weight management (adding excercise to calorie budget) was removed and it has not been brought back. Plus the fact that it forces you to give access to your phone number, if you want to use the app. Absolutely no reason for this other than data mining. This used to be the best health app, especially because it was free. It's useless now."
"The app in my S9+ was great, I could track my steps, and set daily target steps üö∂‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è, but now, that's no more. Unless the feature is hidden, maybe I can be assisted to get it back. Now using S22 Ultra."
Doesn't sync up with other apps anymore. Used to allow permissions to apps (Like AlwaysOn) to sync steps for health tracking apps but now it doesn't have that option
Since 3rd Feb it no longer syncs with Renpho App? Why not? Do I have to revert back to Google Fit again. Seems nothing really works anymore with Samsung apps. My contacts and sms message app I've had to change back to Google acc as well. Using A73 mobile only approx 7mths old. NOT A HAPPY SAMSUNG USER THESE DAYS
"Can't remember password for my old account, can't get ID because apparently my info doesn't match, can't make new account because 2FA code fails to send, couldn't open the app anymore after all this went down, then uninstalled to try again and now can't even install again. 10/10, highly recommended! This is the Samsung experience we all want. üòÅ"
"Just okay. But two stars removed coz it's guzzling the battery power on my Google phone. Looks like it was okay on Samsung phone but as soon as I changed my phone, it maybe it's the new version - it used 20 pct battery in less than 12 hours!!"
"With latest UI update, application is stopping itself and is restarting again every few minutes. Has to force close it. Have sent multiple feedbacks after last update and problem is not resolved. Nor a new update is released to resolve the issue"
I use my watch in my activities with samsung health. But yesterday in the phone app when i open one activity asked my something about share location. I choose no. After that time i can't see the map from my activity on the phone app. I can see only in the watch app. I believe is a setti g but i can't find it. How i can fix it?
"I love this app and it hurts that I have to rate it so low. This was my first fitness app I've used, I even bought a Fit2 watch for myself as an add-on for it. But I've been experiencing so many issues from calorie counter being broken on normal walks, to the app turning it's step counter on my phone on automatically when I want it to be done on my watch instead. The app needs some serious fixes and improvements. Still a very easy to use app, great for beginners. But needs serious fixes."
"I used to love this app and used it to track hikes and walks. It was precise. My walking group relied on my app for details of the walk. It seriously is a total mess now! It maps in straight lines only and usually, in the end, only shows a triangle and marks the lines as always 2 miles...even when we've walked 4, 5 or 6. I called Samsung who made me delete cache and data to see if it improves but No! It's just as bad. I checked it properly today....yep! Mapped a triangle, 2 miles long."
"When's ECG coming to Qatar? Watch 3 and 4 and 5 launched, but this feature is not yet available. The customer is paying full price for a device without being able to use all its features. 3 stars because the app is good."
"It doesn't record your steps automatically even though you have put setting on Auto. And even when it has started recording, it doesn't count 1/4 to 1/2 of your steps if you put it in your pocket/bag, or just don't swing your arms with every step! I like the training features and they are free!"
No longer fully syncingwith watch. Re did settings and uninstalled and still refuses to connect. It's a galaxy 5. Also no longer counts steps on the phone itself galaxy s 22.
"Thanks for forwarding my suggestion. I would request you please bring back the weight management feature, as well as the old style of history charts from before the app redesign (summer of 2020.)"
"The food/ calorie/ nutrition tracker is not very good. It doesn't have the serving sizes in units shown on packaging. Example: fat free half & half, on the container 1 serving is 2 tablespoons in the app 1 serving is 30ml. It shows carbs, fats and proteins, however it doesn't show sugar or a breakdown of complex carbs or simple carbs. If they are going to display the information, they should display it all."
"The app has been crashing, not loading properly and losing count to my steps and messing with my watch's count. It has been on like this for over a week now."
I see always a yellow notification mark on the App. I check if there is a new notification but I can't find. I touch everywhere but I couldn't find any new notification. It makes me so angry. So that I'm thinking of uninstalling it.
"7 years later, still does not provide simple features as other step counter do. A feature to add additional walking steps and fix it manually. I don't understand why this seems to be such a hard üòï, impossible task for your developers. Also, it doesn't count the steps accurately compared with other Stepcounters. Missing features are Step Sensitivity (low, medium, high) step length, gender. Stride length calculation etc. I'm highly disappointed. Hoped for more üò• üëé not 5 worth"
"Before the last update it was OK, a few crashes etc. But now the notification showing how many steps I have done today just says Samsung Health Started. I have to go into the app to find this basic info that was always there and very handy."
This app has become pretty much useless since it won't connect to a variety of accessories - Only Samsung. Also I used to could input data manually and now I cannot so it's useless.
"Great app. I use it all the time, mainly tracking my weight and blood glucose levels. However, they is a bug with the blood glucose UI. When my accessory, an Accu-Chek, sends a new value, the ""all results summary screen"" shows the last but one reading even though the details screen shows the correct last reading."
"Really disappointed in Samsung. Had a watch 4 in 2022 but now I don't have a Samsung phone I cannot use the ECG or BP feature, as Samsung tie it to their phone thru as separate app. Well done Samsung, another reason to not but your products, along with the appalling battery life."
"Latest version does not work, it just says "" SS health started"" in S22 notification bar...no record no wake detection by phone usage at all. Updated: working now after re-enable it manually"
"Some weight training exercises are inaccurate when counting Reps, such as Lateral Raises and Front Raises, it doesn't count a lot of the reps. If Ive done 10 reps it will barely count 2. In addition, more exercises should be added, such as butterflies, and more dubell workouts."
"Please add more challenges once the monthly challenge is over. If I finish the monthly challenge in 10 days, remaining days of the month I will not have anything. Having challenges available throughout the month will help to stick to the daily steps."
The app has gotten much better over the years. My question now is about the nap feature since there is no information on how it's calculated or what determines when you're napping. There isn't a note or anything about this feature in the app.
"This is the best health tracking app I've used. I would give it 5 stars but there are a couple of issues to do with accessories. When data is added to the app via Bluetooth from an accessory (different manufacturers) it always adds the data with the wrong time, always 1 hour ahead. Because of this time discrepancy the data is not updated on the main page until the time has past 1 hour later. This time discrepancy doesn't happen when adding data manualy or when added from a Samsung watch."
"Good, but would be nice if you could add your water intake by oz instead of glass. I drink from different sized bottles so by glass is not at all accurate."
"I wish you could add more variety to your fitness plans in fitness tab. Otherwise, this is a great fitness app to track your days and nights."
"This seems like a nice app, but without the ability to add prepared meals ahead for the week, it's useless to me. I often don't have time to input everything in ""today."""
"App just keeps getting worse. At one point there was a calorie tracker that told you how much you've consumed vs how much you've burned for a calorie deficit. I can't enter a value for calories burned when I do cardio everything has a baseline (Example ""other"" workout burns 666 calories for 1 hour) Needs to bring back the old calorie counter and be able to enter calories burned on workouts."
"Add a feature to allow me to edit the awake stage value as it's wrong. Lying in bed after waking up is not the intent of the awake value thereby skewing the metrics. Also when will these new features be activated in USA: blood pressure, temperature and blood glucose tests. Also on the oxygen existing scan the Heart Rate is done with it automatically so why don't you record the heart rate measurement under the heart rate view too since it was done as part of oxygen reading."
Always loved the features of this app however I can no longer edit incorrect information. I can delete an errored sleep time but if it says I slept longer than I actually did I can't edit it. Even though I'm trying to shorten the time it keeps telling me that I can't extend the time. This needs to be fixed in order to keep more accurate data.
I am trying to Sync my Data with my Samsung Account. Both Auto Sync and Manual Sync not working over either WiFi or Cellular Networks. I lost a lot of data over this issue in the past. Does anyone know how to solve this one?
I would like to see a fitness tracker that corresponds with the challenge app. Also when you get near a star there is no ability to see what the timer says as my head blocks it. I asked my friend to look as she is further behind me and she so she can't see it because my head is blocking it now she may be able to do so once I move on but that doesn't help me in the meantime to see how much time there is left to get my star
"I should not be REQUIRED to allow access to my phone number to be shared unless I actually want to have people find me by my phone number, otherwise I just want to use the features that come with the phone. So tired of forced permissions."
"I would have rated 5 stars but after the latest update I now have a notification symbol on my app that will not go away... I have check everything and nothing... It's still there, I have restarted phone, uninstalled n reinstalled app, everything and still there .... Please fix! And I'll rate 5 stars ..."
"I have the Samsung Watch 5, and this app works quite well. However, there are two minor things I'd like to see added. There are nights where I simply don't get any sleep, and there doesn't seem to be a way to account for that. Manual entry would be fine, but it does throw off the average if you enter a manual 10 minutes, and doesn't count it otherwise. Also, tracking caffeine intake would be helpful. Other than that, it's clean, responsive, and works well."
Use to work well. But lately keeps popping up that app is uploading. Has been uploading for days now. Now looking for a replacement step/calorie/mile counter. Because constant uploading is annoying.
"Thank You for the help,I'm glad I can still use oxygen sensor,this is a major part of the reason I loved samsung health,so again Thank You for letting me know where to find it,I used to love the app.but after update,no oxygen sensor,which is main reason I used it. I'll probably delete the app now and get another oxygen sensor app."
"Update 6 Nov 2022: Exercise feature has stopped working with outdoor walking, map function is broken, timer stops after between 1m27s to only 17s. I tried turning off wifi thinking it was quitting when switching from wifi to data, still garbage data from a 10-15 minute walk consistently recording less than 30 seconds. Samsung Galaxy S21 Samsung Galaxy watch 5pro I have run updates, no change Responsive to compatibility issues with new phones. A lot of important information all in one place."
Ever since the update my steps don't show on my phone. I followed previous review directions and still isn't there. The icon is on my notifications but now I have to open the app to look at my steps. NOT CONVENIENT.
"I've been fighting with this app for 3hrs. I've enabled everything under the sun, wiped cache, repaired apps, uninstalled and reinstalled, NOTHING works. No idea why. It just says ""All applications associated with this action have been turned off or blocked, or are not installed."" I have no idea what the heck it wants me to do. Seems I have no other option but to factory reset my phone... which is the last thing an app should require of a phone to work."
"This app has much to recommend it: many functions (calorie and nutrition monitor, step counter etc). I connect S Health to Lifesum (calorie and exercise tracker). Whenever I change a meal in Lifesum, multiple copies of calorie entries (up to five times in some cases) are added to the S Health calorie tracker, so I have to go in and delete often thousands of calories I did not eat. This is very annoying and prevents a higher rating for an otherwise quite useful app. Please fix?"
"The sleep portion of the app is erratic. Sometimes it records periods of reading or watching TV as being periods of sleep (that then have to be deleted). Sometimes it fails to record actual periods of sleep. The problem I had with the app changing the time of manual sleep entries has been fixed, so I have edited my review and brought the rating back up."
"Conclusions this app draws based on its data are highly inaccurate, for sleep. It regularly gives me the greatest sleep scores even when for instance I've slept only a few hours (I need 7.5 at minimum) telling me I got a good percentage of REM sleep and must therefore feel very refreshed mentally... And shows you views on data that are misleading and wrong, for instance by not taking into account the times you weren't wearing the watch (for stress). This app just wants to make you feel good."
"This has to be 1 of the worse apps I've ever seen. It's down most of the time, measure stress, forget about it, constantly says make sure finger is on sensor, well gee, don't have to be a rocket scientist to see your finger is on the sensor, the app can't pick it up. What a waist of memory having this, definitely deleting it, even though it came with the phone!!!!!"
Horrible User Design (UX). The Blood Oxygen During Sleep graph is unreadable. Use some contrast! Make charts expandable. I can't imagine how a phone call will fix bad design!
"I have recently moved from Huawei to Samsung but with the Watch 5 it does not track treadmill runs accurately. It is off by at least 25% with the treadmill. Treadmill shows 5km and watch 5 shows just less than 4km and this is very frustrating. Could you not make it to adjust distance manually after the run? The app itself is very good, only wish I could change the distance either on the phone app or on the watch after each run."
"Running and walking tracking is terrible. It will not auto stop when you start driving, it just assumes you are running 60+mph and ruins all tracking."
No problems until it randomly stopped syncing my Peloton workouts. It says it is communicating with Peloton but stopped displaying rides in the exercise history log. SO frustrating :(
"Love all the details tracked, but when will you add pickleball to the list of available exercise activities? Also, in earlier versions, there was the option to pause counting steps. Bring this option back as I easily rack up 13k steps on my riding mower!"
"I use this app for everything and it's normally amazing, but recently the period cycling tracker has been intermittently buggy. Not sure why but sometimes it won't let me input and see my calendar etc."
"Used to be able to monitor my vitals after upgrading my phone with ""better"" sensors it doesn't even give me the option to record blood pressure or pulse etc..It's failing lately. It's now constantly disconnecting my watch from my phone and resynching. Used to be an awesome app. Can You Fix It??"
"Overall the app is good, even though I haven't tried out each & every bit of it. I have a suggestion for samsung team. It would be really good to include a pause & resume steps option on cover screen of flip 3 and above models. It comes in handy & helps in keeping track of actual steps as some times it records steps while driving @ low speeds."
Cannot sign to app on my pixel 7 pro sends me code for two step verification but will not give me drop down box to input in app l never had this with my pixel 4a pixel 6 or my nothing phone. Very poor tried several tmes. Updated wasn't phone or application s fault it was me managed to login overall had this application 5 years and is a good health app
Great except sleep tracking. My DR monitors this app and there are 2 things that are inconsistent. 1 sometimes it registers me sleeping when I'm not. Last night I went to bed at 11pm. It says I was asleep from 9-11 when I was watching TV. This would be ok if you could edit out 2 hours but you can't. Only option is to delete entire sleep record losing all other sleep data. 2 sleep O2 is off. If I wear on inside wrist it is better but still off. I had a home sleep study & O2 off by 10! App or ‚åöÔ∏è?
"Since last update I can no longer edit my sleep data unless I completely delete it. I use a GearFit 2 and dont want to lose the sleep details, but occasionally I need to edit the time up or down. It will not let me! Just keeps saying ""You can only reduce recorded sleep time, not increase it."" But I'm currently trying to reduce it, and it still won't let me. Please fix it!"
"The together screen is really confusing. In monthly challenges, it's shown as people are daily walking above 100,000 steps on an average, which is roughly 72 kilometers daily. And it's not stats of one or two person,it's for more than 1000 people. Is it really correct??"
"I've used the Samsung app for many years standalone on my phone and I would rate it 4 to 5 stars, except... I fired it up today and I was greeted bye a screen demanding that I create an account to continue using the app and save my health data in their cloud. There was no alternative offered to keep running the app locally so I saved my data and said goodbye. Bye, bye! Postscript - Samsung, you are not listening to your customers. Read all of our reviews. You had a great app. Now you don't."
"Your Samsung account offers several security features, including SmartThings Find and Secure Wi-Fi. If you choose to use these features, we may collect information such as your device‚Äôs physical location, recent calls and text messages, touch interactions, your device‚Äôs PIN, password or pattern, subscription details and Digital Key details. ""Security"" ""features"" or as human beings call it, spyware"
"The timed exercise option for walking only shows 'duration' data now. Before the update, it used to show remaining time as well so I knew how much more I had to walk. I don't understand why they had to remove that useful feature, it kept me motivated to meet my target time."
"Used to love this app but ever since this last update, I can no longer see my daily activity stats. Also, cannot seem to get the notifications or have my step count visible from home screen. Please fix this Samsung."
"I can't log into the app. When I attempt to do so, I'm sent to my chrome browser to a page that says my browser isn't supported along with a list of compatible browsers. Is there a work around?"
"It worked great on Samsung J7 Pro. But when I shifted to Vivo Y72 5g, the app auto pauses randomly while walking. Very very annoying problem. I reinstalled it several times to no avail. I don't know whether it is a problem with the update or Samsung optimised this app for working only on Samsung mobiles. And, it also doesn't auto detect my walking anymore like my old Samsung mobile did faithfully. Update: Hopeless app. Doesn't work on any mobile other than Samsung."
"I have been using this app in conjunction with MyFitnessPal for a few years and I have found it useful. My concern is that it seems with the latest update of either Samsung Health or MyFitnessPal, if I miss doing a day of myfitnesspal, then go back and complete the missed day in a few days time, the information is not transferred to Samsung Health. This becomes annoying as I try to review progress in Samsung Health."
Make monthly challenges where you have to opt out.. there are times where I thought I joined the monthly challenge and then find out that I didn't. The amount of steps/miles that some ppl have I don't see how is possible... something is off...its as if their phone and possibly smartwatch are both adding to the total which is giving a false count... during competitions I don't see how that's fair...
"In a more recent update, Samsung removed the continuous heart rate tracking feature and replaced it with a min-max chart, which essentially renders heart tracking useless using this app. Supposedly this was done to hide inconsistent HR tracking because earlier models of the watch don't track HR well enough. Very disappointed as i just got the new watch 5. Bring back continuous heart rate tracking!!!!!!"
"Still a trash app. Yesterday... out of the blue, Shealth decided to forget my whole step history. Today, it forgot yesterday's total. Although it 8a keeping a cumulative total for the step challenge. So, the one thing SHealth should be doing, counting and maintaining a step record, it no longer seems to be doing. If only Samsung could maintain basic functionality in their apps. If only."
When I got my new phone the app is missing some features that I used on a daily basis. Most important was the o2 sensor and now it is no longer available. I don't like having to carry around the tool separately when it used to be so convenient on my phone. Also I can not just check my stress or heart rate on the phone. I have to do it from my watch and that will only do the heart rate.
"This sucks! Why can't you delete parts of the sleep cycle that's not correct? It has you sleeping while working at the computer or watching TV, what is up with that! What good is it when it can't tell the difference! Every time this is updated something gets screwed up! I used to be able to adjust and delete sleep info without having to delete all the info. Samsung has taken away the oxygen and heart rate sensors and I've asked so many times to have rebounder added to exercise! Time to delete!"
Sleep is not properly recorded. It records the wrong time and duration. The information appears random and often captures less than 10 percent of the actual time and records sleep during the day when the sleep occurred at night. My Smart Watch captures the correct information.
"I have loved this thing for accountability, but not sure why the Blood oxygen doesn't work on my phone or watch. On Heart rate the phone no longer has an option to measure it directly from there. I truly loved this app and would show it to other people, now it's just not the same. It once was an outstanding app, now it's seems subpar. I've looked to see if am update was due or if there was a separate app to download for the missing options. Ppl want SP02 due to Covid, its not available."
"This used to be a 5 star rating synced between my Galaxy s20+ and Galaxy watch. Now the Galaxy s22 ultra and it won't sync anymore. In response to Samsung's response, I called them twice about this issue and spent about 3 hours on the phone and both calls got dropped. Still no update to the software. I'll keep raring this with a one star until you fix it. Quit telling me to call customer service. They know nothing. Make my 7b5b work with my s22 ultra."
"I keep getting sever error and can't open the app, I like being able to track my steps but since the last update it doesn't work even after restarting my phone."
Sleep Section and Sleep Score are Highly Innacurate as the algorithm has been altered in the last updates and the Sleep scores are now highly inaccurate and fluctuate wildly. The Score also includes the total sleep time (includes awake time) and Not the Actual sleep time. The reason I got my new Galaxy 5 watch was the Sleep function to pair with my Samsung phone. Very disappointing. Is Samsung aware of this issue and planning on fixing in the next update or should we all switch to Apple?
"Great app, but when you change time zones, it messes up the food logs. I had to adjust and re-add past meals for accurate tracking. Please, if you could, fix that. Otherwise, no issues!"
"So far a decent app. My issue is with the sleep record function. If you try to set the sleep while its past midnight it will not work example it's 12am and set bedtime to 1am to wake up 7am it does not work. It says it can't set time in the future and will not record, a bummer. Guess it's not for night owls, lol."
The app was great around 6 years ago. Since then it is getting unnecessary complicated and shady. Phone permission is required but perm. for step tracking is not. You have to log in with a bunch of shady optional permissions. The food library feel got even poorer. The weight graph is made to confuse users. It is not possible to understand the date internals. I missed S Health with colorful logo times.
"Extremely frustrating to see another user report the same issue I'm having, 'upgraded to the S22 and now can't use several important features of this health app', only to have a rep for the app NOT provide help unless you call? That's BS. If there is a fix for this problem, FIX IT FOR EVERYONE. I want my app functionality back!"
"Needs a lot of improvement I have a Concept 2 rower which I use regularly and there's no way to manually enter the distance or calories burned. If I enter the time manually it loses about 100 calories over a 30 minute period. To add insult to injury as it were, I tried recording my time today and the app keeps telling me that I've already done so I restarted the phone twice to see if that would resolve things. Also, how hard is it to draw lines between two points on a graph?"
"Disappointed the newer version doesn't measure stress & heart rate. These were great features on previous versions. I can't even manually add heart rate from another app. ‚òπÔ∏è Generally very good, but the nutritional info is often insufficient, inaccurate or conflicting."
"I've been using the app since September, and I like it. Although the monthly step challenge, there are to many cheaters on it. There is no way people are averaging 50 miles of steps every day!! Also wish they had more challenges besides steps."
I have been using this off and on for several years and love this app for what I use it for. Tracking my activities throughout the day. The food tracker could be improved by a barcode scanner. Sometimes it's hard to find the foods you are looking for but overall I really enjoy it.
"Is good enough, but many metrics are missing. Like for example HRV. All smartwatch manufacturers are showing HRV data because it is crucial for fitness and health. Why not you Samsung? You already capture the RR interval for the stress measurement, why don‚Äôt you give us the data? Also, please please please allow us to pair chest straps with your watches!"
The step & heart monitor are great. There are a ton of workout exercises & love the stress level check. The sleep monitor is almost pointless and there is no way to log food for a previous day. They need to work on these if they want to be considered full health tracker.
Sleep time needs to be recorded manually now. My watch used to send the sleep recording to the app and it would automatically show me how much sleep I got along with the graf for the breakdown. I have tried all of the quick fixes I could find and it still doesn't work.
"This was auto-installed after the last Samsung phone app. I don't need or want this. I've uninstalled once and it re-installed again without my permission. I should be able to control what is and isn't on my phone, instead of having pointless apps that I don't use auto-installing."
"I have used this many years excellent however since the last update, Dec 22, the calorie calculation in weightlifting or circuit training is very inconsistent, please fix it back!! Otherwise highly recommended. Samsung Health offered a fix and it's working great. 5 Star!"
"The app no longer opens, I've been tracking my health for the pass few years as had a few problems and have lost all the history and can no longer track it. Tried clearing cache and uninstalling and downloading again but not worked. Been like this since Oct 22"
"Before S22 Great! With S22 Useless. The functionality has been greatly reduced with the S22. No longer have stress management, heart rate monitor and the steps are wildly inaccurate now. If the intent was to get me to purchase a Galaxy watch, it failed. Instead, I bought a Fitbit Versa4 and am pleased with it and the fitbit app."
"Missing exercise type... I can add that I have been hangliding (I don't do it), but there's no option for netball?? Netball is an international sport, played at professional all the way down to amateur level (it's taught to our children in school). Please can this be added in... I'm recording it as Basketball currently, but it's not the same (just the closest I can get). Please add Netball to the list of exercise/ workouts..."
"The app is really plain and flat. Interface quite boring, lacks color, not engaging, unlike what I saw with Garmin and other fitness apps. This needs an overhaul. It doesn't readily track items like heart rates, resting heart rate. The watch is great but the app is lacking"
Love the app with my galaxy watch but super buggy. It sometimes pause program and sometimes the app says I didn't finish my workout program. It's super frustrating. I wish they would take the time to fix these bugs.
"Samsung Health with Samsung Galaxy watch clasic 4 stop displaying Average Pace for running activity (not tested other). In history I see on Dec-10 and earlier always display avg.pace. But recordings from past 2 weeks shoving avg.pace --'--"" I tried to report error to Samsung, but it require access to my files (no comment - but absolutelly crazy). Can anybody help me here - at least tell me how to raise incident to Samsung with it, please? Thank you Richard"
"Sends sales notifications after disabling them. I don't want to receive notices about products pushed to my watch like a text message. I will never buy another Samsung product. My phone, tablet, TV and watch all have annoying issues like this."
"I used the SpO2 measuring feature a lot, but now on this update, the feature isn't available anymore along with a lot others. It doesn't feel convenient anymore. I still use the Galaxy S10 which has a sensor for heart rate and SpO2 monitoring, but I can't use it anymore along with my Gear S3 watch."
"It used to be the best app, i lost weight using it.. But you removed the set goal weight feature where you can manage how much calories you need to take.. This was the only reason i have a Samsung app and now i might change if it doesn't come back.. I hope you bring bakc this fundamental feature"
"Wish it had an option to manually add how many calories you burned doing xyz exercise, would help breastfeeding moms, or just add a breastfeeding option. Pregnant women also like to watch their health, could add that as an option as well. If it had those it would be the perfect health app for me."
"I used to love it. Before it started crashing all the times when reading my sleep data for no apparent reasons. I have an s20+ and a Galaxy Watch 4, not exactly ancient devices and yet, crashing is constant, i sent feedback through the app to no avail. Samsung where art thou?"
App doesn't work half the time. It says it syncs with my watch and it doesn't until hours later. Food database sucks. Fitbit is better and much more affordable if you buy a watch for just the fitness aspect.
Doesn't work on new phone. I had a Samsung Galaxy and upgraded to the new Pixel pro. The app does not work and is a known issue that Samsung just doesn't care about. The work around to get it to work are sketchy AF. I'm about ready to just buy a pixel watch. So frustrating!
"Sleep data worked for all of 2 nights before just turning into a flat time slept vs rem, deep, light and activity. EKG on the Samsung Watch just says download the app(which is downloaded) blood oxygendata just stopped flowing, there is no way to keep the watch incorrectly positioned(high and tight on your wrist) throughout a night of sleep."
"I like the app, been using it for years now. But lately it will pick and choose when to track my steps. It'll work in the morning usually then stop later in the day for whatever reason. It's really annoying and I hope it gets fixed"
"Many features do not work. I do not have a Samsung phone, but. Google Pixel, so the features I was most interested in are not available or don't work very well. Would not recommend if you have a Pixel- can't speak to other Android platforms."
Functional but lacks more exercises. Should be integrated with google fit if it really requires it to be installed too. More favorite exercises would also be nice and inputting data easier as well as editing already auto detected.
Fitbit makes Samsung look obsolete. The steps and sleep are ok but a huge part of health and weight loss/management is in the kitchen. I don't understand why Samsung doesn't have a barcode scanner to easily add what you are eating. I also don't understand why you can only track by serving size. I weigh all of my food and go off of the oz. I haven't gotten into the workout part as I've just started using this app this afternoon.
"It was working well for a long time, but now it is no longer possible to add new weights. It is possible to delete old weights, but when you click to record a new one, add the data and click save, it doesn't save anymore. This appears to have happened after the update on 13/Oct/2022."
"It's getting worse and worse. Workouts recordings are inaccurate. Steps count inaccurate. Some of workouts not recorded, Some recorded twice."
Mostly a good app and useful to work with My Fitness Pal. The down side is there is no setting for stride length and therefore no way to track miles or the possibility you might be actually running which means that calorie burn is way off too. It would be nice to have that feature since one can not run outdoors every day on the rainy Pacific northwest.
"App is very bad now! Does not count my miles when I start my workout, only count steps. It use to tell me when I reached each mile, my speed, avg speed, etc and tell me when I reached my goal. Now I just walk, and only see the number of steps and it shows 0 miles walked"
Used this app a few years ago and loved it; multiple preset runs with a voice that would advise speeding up or slowing down. Noting your pace is good but having a voice to tell you to advise you on speed to maintain a target pace was monumental to getting me from an 8yr dryspell of running to blasting out an 8min. Mile at the age of 40. Please ring it back.
"Overall I love this app, but twice now it has had me asleep going through the sleep cycles when I was watching things on my computer. I was sitting upright at a desk and did not fall asleep at all. I wanted to update the info on the app but it won't let me. Otherwise I find the sleep info quite accurate."
"After the major app crashes in September, I've been forced to find and use other fitness apps. I learned that THIS app is steaming garbage in comparison. Forced to use it to continue syncing with my watch. Will probably buy a Garmin next time so I don't have to deal with constant crashes, inaccurate readings, etc."
Pretty good app does most everything I need for running. My only request is that they'd have a way while running for the target you set it for is reached that it would stamp it on display so that why you'd know the exact time instead of me having to stop it. üòÅ
"Set up won't complete. Just transferred to a new phone and got logged in, but I am stuck at a screen that says ""Check out the following options"" and gives me a few circles to highlight. Won't progress from there. Worked fine on my last phone and the app is updated."
"2022 It lacks a significant feature sleep cycle calculator, clock alarm ! It must be added since the app can detect how many hours you sleep automatically! So you wakeup with good mood based on number of cycles you choose. 2020 Overall, it's nice & usefull. The problem is 250+MB large size & not movable to external SD card üëéüèª. Thanks for replying, I'm running out of space & this app is installing only on phone storage. Make a lite version or give the permission for SD compatibility."
"Great app overall. I just wish I could set when my day starts and ends. I only work night shifts. All the tracking resets at 00:00. But my my day begins in the afternoon when I wake up. my shift is 23:00 - 07:00. So I never get correct steps etc for my ""day"" . Please developers just add a way to set the start of the day so tracking is correct."
"Pedometer doesn't count my steps most of the time while my phone is in my pocket half the time, or I have to restart my phone but the isn't guaranteed it will work either. Also the classes don't pop up in calendar or give reminders."
"I've used this app for years but as soon as I upgraded and got the s23, it will not open. It says ""Can't set up app"" ""Server error occurred. Try again later"" I constantly try again and it will not open up."
"Love this app for simple sleep tracker, for fitness I use a galaxy watch with auto track on. But it would be super cool if they added Pickleball as a workout like apple does."
The last few updates have caused issues with syncing my phone and watch. The app just seem to be permanently stuck in sync mode
"I used to be able to measure my heart rate using the infrared sensor, but the option to record heart rate/stress seems to have been removed from the app entirely."
Heart rate and oxygen function don't work on S23 ultra. Can't believe S23 ultra has fewer functions than S9+. You can use other apps to measure heart rate from playstore with S23. I am sticking to my old phone
I finally figured out the sleep part of Samsung Health. Just turn off the sleep because it totally SUCKS and Samsung was no help at all. How can you bring out an app and have no clue how to fix it? Fire the whole team because they SUCK at their jobs . I would be totally embarrassed by my team if I were Samsung because that team FAILED. Never buy another Samsung phone. I'm done with Samsung. Useless team.
Won't show the weekly activity. Can tap on where the day is suppose to be and the info will pop up as usual but the section is blank. Shows the colored dots like it trying go get the info
"Hi,  This is a great app. But, I purchased the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra and the heart rate, oxygen, and blood pressure features no longer work. What do I do? Thanks FD"
Use to be better. I just rode my bike for an hour started/stopped the app. Says I rode for an hour but 0.00mileage??? Not impressed... looking for a better one. This ain't it.
It is a great app but wish they can bring back the endurance workouts because it really helps and motivate us to improve our pace.
"I love this app, but would be awesome to be able to copy an activity entry from one day to another or create an entry manually as i have forgotten to start an activity on my watch and then have no way of adding it later."
"It has been a great app but since a month or so no longer counting the daily steps, other exercise or sleep. Super annoying."
I downloaded it and have used it on other phones. Got a new S22 and there is nowhere to hit a begin recording heart rate or stress rate. Main thing I use it for.
"It is now bugging somehow and I can't keep track of my total calories burned through the week. I wish I could see yesterday's data somehow, but it keeps loading forever"
"Doesn't provide total calories burned for the previous day(s). Also, doesn't track flights/stairs."
"Calculating sleep hours from midnight to midnight makes no sense. It should be noon to noon, or even better, individually configurable."
"Sounds like a good idea. I f only it would work! : ""Can't set up app - server error occurred. Try again later""."
Unable to change my Date of Birth in health app. My Samsung account has correct date of birth but samsung health app is showing incorrect one and I am not able to change it since it is greyed.
This app was great until I had to reset my phone. Now all I get is a 0x2a#0 error. I've tried all of the suggestions with no success.
"Offers metric units for everything except kilojoules and Samsung appears to refuse to add this very simple option. From the look of forums, they have not programmed this very simple task of multiplying something by the conversion factor of 4.184 for about 7 years. Also, the Galaxy Watch 5 is mostly useless at getting a GPS fix."
I wish the team would get on top of those participating in the global walking challenges. No one is walking 80 miles a day. Everyone in the top 10 are lying and cheating. I doubt they are running a perfect 6 minute mile....for 8 hours straight. It makes the challenges less fun.
"The account registration is a terrible experience that require a new Samsung account even when using Goole account to sign in. 2FA using sms is not secure but Samsung wants you to use it just to get your phone number. Then it tries to collect data about my cycles. No, not my bikes. I'm a guy you stupid!"
"Installed and then uninstalled once I realised it wanted to know my phone number and access all my contacts. I tried to deny access but it won't let you use the app without giving away your phone number and the number of all your contacts too. So the watch has been turned off and thrown in a drawer. No doubt I'll get some response supposed to reassure me this is all normal, but of course it is not."
"***Edit*** I have ordered a new Fitbit Smartwatch, and it will arrive tomorrow. I am removing this Samsung Health app. It is ridiculously inaccurate. While I was sleeping (with the watch on the charger), Samsung Health counted 540 steps! I give up!! _______________ There are some great features on this app, but...one thing that is so frustrating is the step count and distance are inaccurate. Please, please add the ability to set our own stride distance manually."
"Doesn't track weekly heart zone totals. Heart zone bar graph doesn't always accurately register my workout. GW4 is a really good smart watch, not so good at fitness tracking."
I'm not sure what has happened but the app won't launch anymore. I've used this app for years to track all of my exercises but I have had to use other apps now. I've tried uninstalling and installing it again but it still won't launch.
"So every time I restart my phone I get an annoying notification saying the app is running?? Well no s__t ALL APPS you choose run in the background, yet this is only one with an annoying notification."
The persistent notification previously had steps on it making it easy to check steps on a phone. Now you need to open the whole app to check step count. Hopefully this is changed back.
Why there is no support of ANT+ devices anymore?!! It was THE only good thing in this creepy app. It's so silly to quietly remove valuable feature. Samsung proves to be a sore loosers. Great job!
"I am unable to change the data to show when I am cycling. I just want distance, time and speed with heart rate every mile."
The app randomly quits counting steps! It seems Samsung has decreased their reliability on this platform. Very disappointing as a long time Samsung phone owner.
"Sleep data issue still not fixed completely. But Samsung pro, or whatever was helpful. When you guys fix the sleep data properly. I might add another star.."
"I've been a continous user of this aap, lately the decision to remove the fitness sections was really uncomfortable no videos are available now ,reason to own a galaxy was this unique app for me, thanks to promote me for having last galaxy device, why MNCs always keep on dropping good things for their customers. Really unexpected form Samsung."
"the only calorie tracking app that i actually understand how to use. the workout plans are nice, i never do it on my own but seeing them there encourages me to try them out."
"After the last update it no longer registers corectly when you wake up, or more specific, it doesn't end your sleep cycle when it should - linked with Watch ative 2. You have to open the app, otherwise your sleep will include that period of you being awake"
Constant crashes and lackluster features in US. False advertising such as continued stripping or undelivered features on Active 2 watch. Wont buy another Samsung after my current devices die.
Latest update has stopped syncing my weight from my smart scale and this app no longer syncs my steps to myfitnesspal. I liked having all my apps talk to each other but this update has stopped that.
Was a really good app using it since years but now its too slow. The menstrual cycle feature just keeps loading forever and I can't edit it at all.
Duplication of Activity. I'm synching this app to MFP and got the last few days all my activity is being synced more than once and duplicating over and over and I can't figure out why this is.
"Good allrounder app, but the fact that one can only add a maximum of 100 custom foods is a dealbreaker, and I'll have to start using another app for counting calories."
It would be great if you guys could implement barcode scanning for the food tracker! Everything else is good.
Heart rate monitor doesn't work anymore. I've used it in the past however on a few occasions recently I tried to use it and it's impossible to get a result however many times I try to reposition my finger
Terrible app. Both funtionality and accuracy. Bot will probably Thank me for feedback and direct me to do something other than have this app work properly. Disappointing Samsung puts its name on this app. Will be deleting
It randomly counts my steps even though I've turned the automatic detection off and resticted background usage. I don't like that at all.
"Ur update eliminate all the details of the previous app such a routed walked, elevation, and vocal encouragement of miles walk, etc. I prefer the previous app."
"It doesn't calculate the steps at all. Edit: I'm holding the phone, and it doesn't count any steps at all! Gonna find another app that really works other than this."
I transferred this app from my note 8. Now it doesn't allow me to log in on my S22 Ultra by sending information to my Note 8. Just a vicious circle to get my phone and password changed.
"I really enjoy this app. It's easy to use and I find tracking calories, exercise, water intake to be simple."
"During cycling, after reach around 30 km, the aps stop following my route, and directly jump to my finish line, creating straight line from 30 km point to finish line Edited. : why no sugar tracker? Calcium, Sodium, Potassium are there, but sugar?"
"I returned to this app now that I have a Galaxy watch, was enjoying but it started malfunctioning dates. I see no way to correct it, perhaps uninstalling and reinstalling. I would like to see reminders about drinking water. Just having a way to input for someone like my husband is no help. Another thing would be explinations about how activity is moved ahead and just what it means. Oh yes, a way to input steps. Occasionally I forget to put watch on after charging and take off for a walk."
"So I've used this app for a long time and it's pretty self-explanatory. However, every now and again - like now, I have a glitch with tracking water intake where I am on a day, and it adjusts the day before or after. I have the latest updates. How do I fix this?"
"The automatic blood pressure capacity was removed on the Watch 5, and it was called a 'feature'. The ECG analysis is always 'inconclusive'. Sleep monitoring is good."
"Went downhill! No longer a useful app when stress , oxygen , etc levels can no longer be tracked."
"Was mostly using this to track steps and distance walked, lately it has gone from randomly counting 10-50 steps per hour while docked at night to recording as many as 12,000 steps in a few hours while sitting in a cradle."
"You allow for the crappiest body scale Mifit to be added to your app, but don't allow for the amazfit body scale to be added or even an option for it to be added. Need to step your game up."
"I've been using this app on my phone for 7 years, suddenly it's telling me I have to sign in to my Samsung account to use it. I don't know if I have a Samsung acct (since I have a Samsung phone) or if I have to create a new one? It's saying I'm going to lose all my data if I download it again. Very annoying."
Won't count treadmill steps anymore on my watch5 pro I've tightened my band restarted phone and watch. Seems latest update screwed something up. I loved the app before this issue
"Used to love this app, but recently it is not tracking steps evenly/accurately. Very disappointing. Will be looking for a new and better tracker."
I jave been using the app for years now and the App would be perfect and gotten 5 stars if there was a drink section. Not all drinks are with meals and should have an entry spot.
"Excellent app for my Galaxy watch 4, but why do you need a separate app + a plugin to connect to it? Also i cannot change my date of birth, It's locked at Jan 1, 1990. Is this because i don't use a Samsung phone?"
"Kinda good but very limited. Can't sync steps using health connect app to Google fit??? Wtaf? It's 2023. Your using wear os. Lift your game. Check it out everyone: 500 bucks for a watch, 3.3 star rated app."
The cycling tracking is not working. I could not enter my logs and it is loading all the time. I can not register my data anymore here.
"'Skeletal Muscle' suddenly appeared in my body composition screen. I want to remove it as I only record weight and body fat. On the 'set targets' settings it's greyed out and can't be altered or switched off. How can I get rid of it please?! After the most recent update, this problem is still there! Please fix it. Thanks, Dave."
"After the latest update, exercises won't sync with Google's health connect, if I start them from my watch 4. This is reall frustrating for me. The sync functionality was this year's most awaited feature. Also it doesn't sync steps with health connect. I had to have both Samsung health and Google fit in my watch 4 so that i can have a data backup. Please fix this. Also add a button to provide feedback, so that we don't have to write negative reviews."
"Not a bad app, but it wish it gave you the ability to add custom workout routines, and edit distance for the treadmill. I think these are very important to do for any type of smart/fitness watch, so that's why only 2 stars. If they can fix this, then I would give it 5."
"Shame that Samsung have decided to take away the weight tracking part of the application. I'm going to have to research about migrating to a different service and eventually a different provider for my phone, tablet and watch. Previously I loved the app but wish more services etc connected to it. Also wished I could record my medication on it too. This app now keeps crashing on my phone and I have sent hundreds of reports but it is still useless"
"Despite walking around, working out the daily activity rings keep resetting and goes to zero. Defeats the purpose of the activity tracker."
I'm loving this app for the most part. I got myself a fit2 for the added ease of participating in the challenges. But the thorn in my flesh is the fitness workouts. I will choose something but I can't download the workouts. It will run the whole process and then it's still not downloaded. Also the fact that when you choose to start the workout the next day you can't view the workout in advance to see what's expected from you.
I always having issue on syncing my Samsung gear sport watch and Samsung health app..keep saying couldn't complete sync wit gear sport .as all apps and watch has been updated to latest softwares..can you all fixs it.Thanks
I don't know what changes were made with the recent update but I know it's tracking system is not working correctly. I did a 2.46 miles walk and it's stating that I only walked a distance of 0.32 miles. I usually use this app to track my walking and calories burned. I guess I'll have to use Google fit until this app starts working again.
"Use it with Samsung Watch5 Golf ed. Sleep recording is too sensitive, registers as deep sleep while reading newspaper, watching tv, etc. A number of times it has registered sleep 1 to 1 1/2 hours before falling asleep. There is no way to edit the data, one can delete a record but not edit it. There have been a few instances of 10+ hours of sleep. Not helpful when trying to track sleep for doctors. Have contacted Samsung twice, but the auto chats are useless. This is definitely a software/proble"
"Was a very enjoyable app, really liked it on my new S23 ultra, u till it crashes 2 seconds after opening. Can't access data or enter data now....very frustrated"
"Good app. I use it quite often. However last period the Walking exercise keep pausing, while I am still walking (actually). Which in most cases I have wrong results of my walking exercise. I used this functionality for many years - only last months I have noticed the problem. How can I overcome this issue?"
The app requires you to change default browser to log in. Horrid. My old phone died and this application lost the last entire month of data. Somehow that never synced. Total trash. Wish negative stars were available.
"What happened? I spent money so I could track my health, only me, I didn't sign up for having to share EVERYTHING including my phone number, location, and personal health information with ""nearby devices and any other people who have this app"" (Together I don't want!) or it won't work. Buying a watch and integrating it with my phone and this app should be something I can use privately, not for anyone and everyone else to have access to if I'm not inclined to share it. Waste money, steal privacy."
"I think something happened with a recent update or the SG S22. Since I bought it in July, when I run, I am always short by ,10 mile per mile. It would be very helpful if Samsung added the interval training option, tooüôå I love the monthly challenges Samsung creates to keep us active. I also use this app to manage and track my weight loss challenge and track my distance when i run."
I previously had a Samsung S7 model and all functions of app worked great. I upgraded to Samsung S22 and now I can no longer measure my heart rate or stress level. These functions do not work for newer model phone. I saw another review with the same issue.
The app doesn't seem to be able to finish a heart rate/oxygen level test anymore. It insists either I don't have my finger on the sensor or I've moved it or I'm pressing too hard. Used to work fine.
"I love this app actually.. the only issue is. Why can I not track my daily cholesterol count? It shows how much cholesterol is in food, but it doesn't come up on the bar graphs. Neither does sugar. Also would help if they had a barcode scanner."
"Not as good as it used to be. On my new s22+, I don't even have an option to track my weight and my heart rate like I used to be able to on my S6"
Unable to add Water Intake. Each time a change is made the app freezes for about 5min.
Why would you get rid of total calories burned? Active calories do nothing to help with calorie deficit. I wanna return my watch because of this. My S3 frontier is much better.
"PLEASE SEND ME AN EMAIL ADDRESS SO I CAN SEND INFO 2023 UPDATE doesn't even continuously count steps anymore!! Used to work great, showing steps continuously if wanted on screen without opening app. Don't want to have to open app just to see step count. Not liking this version üòí"
The Samsung health watch app does not reflect the correct time/timezone (mine is 5 hours off. I have called samsung and they say it is a known problem and has been since November (it is now Feb 2023). Do we need to have a class action lawsuit for false advertising that a watch actually keeps time? Fix your software.
"Since your last update, it is not adding auto workouts, and I have auto workouts turned on. Didn't have any problems until last week when the last update came. Please fix this."
Love the app I just wish we could barcode scan for food to make it quicker to tack our food. Some other food tracking apps I have used in the past had this feature.
"Awful user experience on Galaxy Watch 4. The important functions such as ""Stop exercise"" requires swiping however swiping is not possible if sweaty so the app is useless for timing exercises."
"Would give full stars but I cannot, as the ability to switch between Calories and Kilojoules is not present. I live in Australia and I would like to use OUR standard units of measurement. Please implement this."
They have changed the app . It was much better when when you can check your heartgreat. It would be nice if you could check your blood pressure. I don't know about anyone else but I don't need help keeping account of how much water I drink . I need help with my blood pressure my blood sugar and heart rate.
"This app has got worse. If you import food from other app because the food selection in Samsung Health is so poor, it imports multiple copies so always 4 or 5 times actual. Unfortunately it's no better than having a $10 step tracker"
"Was working beautifully for about a month, and then stopped recording my steps. I tried everything suggested on google, but could not get the app to record my steps again. Everything else works except tracking my stepsüò• Samsung z3 Flip Regards Yolinda"
Please make this to where you can edit workouts. My treadmill runs always show up short on the watch. My treadmill knows how far the belt moves so the watch is wrong. Biggest complaint. I need to be able to edit things!
"Tried to submit this through the website or email, but there is no clear way to do so. In togetherness challenges, how do people get more steps than total seconds in a month? No sleep, not sitting down."
"After last update, im dissapointed becaue notofication bar which shows steps is ugly, before nofitication bar was more clear and better. It would be like before so I have notification bar with steps and it shows ONLY steps / steps to do today, but now are steps and its written Your target is x steps to do today so it would be better without this text ""your target is..."" this is ugly and not clear to see. In this bar should only be numbers of steps which i goes and number of steps to do"
Latest update is draining phone battery. Losing 70% in just 10 hours. Did not have this issue with before update. Have tried all suggested fixes to no avail. Please fix bugs.
Loging in doesn't work. It says it needs Samsung internet to work. I will not install any other bloatware. Chrome is supposedly supported but it still doesn't allow me to log in. Uninstalled it.
Stress levels Aren't working properly. For the last couple days it been showing my stress level the same rate throughout the day..no fluctuations.
"When I first installed this app on my device,It worked fine when I used it to record my steps for walking now its malfunctioning now it says that all of my steps may not be counted,I dont understand why doesnt work like it did before it was perfect."
Howcome it not connected in samsung account when I open in setting > account and backup > manage accounts > samsung account. There is no samsung health setting inside of it so i can connect to google fit. Please add aslo other smartwatch outside samsung so i can track my health such as blood presure with vyatta fitme pro. Please also add treadmil kingsmithR1 so i also can use the statistics for diet. Or else pair with mi walkingpad app. Cannot input heart rate manually. Could you Please fix Thx
"It encourages me to keep up when working out. This app has many exercise programs that it's hard get bored, especially if you like to stay active."
"Enjoying the app. But yesterday (Feb 22 2023), the watch nor the phone app wont convert my bicycle workout to equivalent steps anymore to reach my daily goal. Which is the feature i really want but now is gone."
I have been using this app since 2019. It is a great app i loved it specially tracking periods and providing information about fertile window and all. Very easy to use and it always motivates me to improve my health üå∏ Thankyou
I am having similar issues with this app. Prior to updates everything worked well. My steps have not been recorded for 3 days and I can't seem to get the ap working.
I wish you could adjust the sleep portion of the app. It can say you are asleep at times when you're just sitting on the couch or doesn't know when you are awake. It would be nice to be able to adjust it to what is accurate.
"Apparently app doesn't really work on the S23 Ultra. I am unable to use fingerprint for checking HR. Not necessary in my life, but was nice to do on the phone in the morning."
"You do NOT need access to my contacts. I have absolutely no intention of using the Together feature. This should be optional, not a requirement. As a result I have uninstalled the app"
"Now that the weather is warming up I went for a walk with my dogs. When i got home and looked at the app, there was no map. I want to view the map of my walk. I went and looked at my past walks and the map was no longer there either. How do I turn this feature back on? I have spent a great deal of time trying to figure this out."
PLEASE ADD SNORE DETECTION TO THE APP. SOMETHING TO TRACT SLEEP APNEA AND OR SNORING PLEASE Why can't it be fixed to monitor bp for galaxy watch lte version. Should be added to watch without buying a new watch to get the feature. Please include in watch software cause watch is already pricey
Accuracy is not there in the app.while walking steps count are okay. But While driving in car and bus or TT or riding in my bike. Steps are counting like anything. I dnot why its happening in this app for me. @developer please test and try it now.
"Notifications don't seem to be working correctly, keep getting Samsung Health is starting, and no notification in top by clock since latest update."
"I used to love it but since last update it's not recording my steps anymore, I have to click several times on sync to make it count but need to do every time, it became useless."
"Since the update, the app is not counting all my steps. Need to be able to see sugar intake from meals. Also, I need a barcode scanner."
App. Is fine. Hate that us in the USA can't use the Blood pressure feature of our watch and this app. That was why I went with the Samsung watch. The app overall is uneventful.
"The recent update has messed up my cell phone. I'm getting unapproved downloads, and I don't get my text messages. I am very frustrated with Samsung."
"I am surprised why this app shows 2 different calorie burnout. For example if you click Steps tile, it shows far lesser calorie burn then when you click daily activity tab. Can you explain this mystery?"
Poor in daily graphs need updat EX: Can not get a daily graph in detail For heartbit And make it big . Also for snooring reports to post snoring with sleeping and heartbeat on one graph
"Can't even get past 2FA setup phase... Need to enter password several times for some reason, then still go through 2fa setup even when not needed, and then app just craps out...what a waste"
"Good service and reliable enough for healthier lifestyle. I can't buy Samsung's device like walking timer or stopwatch. I have being get heart disease in 60th,so my doctor instruct to make walking exercise every day.Thanks you so much for Samsung Health app:."
The app works fine if I could sign in.. probably. Seems an influx of people unable to sign in furthering with the addition of each update.
"Step counter stopped working after ladt update, I uninstalled the app, thinking it would fix it, BUT I lost all data. Even with synching on. What the hell?"
Update demands permission to my phone and contacts list and refuses to let the app run without it. This effectively bricks my watch unless I opt in to their social network scheme. Big L. Edit after developer response: I'm not opting in. I don't need to connect with other users or do taxes or whatever else on a product that I purchased to monitor my heart rate and general physical activity. I've uninstalled the app. I've also wiped my watch and tossed it into my junk drawer.
I am having serious difficulties signing into my app. I did an update and it is causing major issues that it won't let me log in no more. Help!!!
For some reason my step count no longer shows on the front screen. Even going into setting does not help. Thanks for the prompt reply issue now sorted .
"Since the recent update, Murphy's Law has taken over. Anything that can go wrong will go wrong. My phone will no longer connect to my watch, and every time I try to fix a problem, a new problem comes. Prior to the update, everything was fine."
I was really happy with this app until the latest update. Now the step counter has become very temperamental and is not counting my steps correctly. Any ideas on how to fix it??
Since the last update the total calories burned for the day won't come up. It just spins. I've Uninstalled and re installed and still nothing.
The old level icons with the wings are way cooler than the new icons. Put them back or give us the ability to chose.
It is a pity that you can't view heart rate historically using Samsung Watch 4. It only shows min/ max instead of all the values.
Can't sign in on my Pixel6. Shame on you. Update: the support team ask me to raise the request via Samsung Members app which is not supported on Pixel6 phones. Great. Minus 5 stars to you.
"Love the app but can't get in, won't load the update for terms and conditions. Says can't set up the app."
Samsung software remains constantly terrible over the years and across all their products. Not even sign in works correctly.
I am unable to see my previous days progress. The tab where I would normally scroll through the weekdays is constantly loading with those lil blue dots spinning in a circle. Plz help
"App is good , but the problem is that once you forget your samsung ID it cant be recovered , I suggest to have separate ID for this app so that it can be used any device with simple login"
What is this BS about you having to leave your phone on the charger for snore detection most people aren't morons wanting to leave their phone on the charger all night when it only takes 30 minutes to charge
Was good until latest update. Now the cycle tracking for women's health just flashes as though something is loading and won't let you enter any data at all. Can this be fixed please
Why do I have to use a specific browser to sign in? Why is 2FA a mandatory process that I can't seemingly skip? This is just a horrible experience.
It used to be that the tracking will be real time. Now I only see it updated after a few minutes. Was there a change in the way the app work or it has something to do with the setting of my phone ?
"Worst after update, it used to be accurate when calculating Kilometres ran... Now ? Thee worst, slow to login kilos. I ran 11km this morning but it only recorded 9.9km please fix it"
"Meh stock app. Sadly what works with watch. Wish the detailed charts were accesable for more then the current day. At least a week, more like a month."
"I have changed to a new mobile phone and there was women's health default in my old device, but in the new one I cannot find where it is and there is no search button."
"An amazing app. Samsung health has changed my life. I love how aware it makes you of everything from Diet, exercise to sleep. It even has a Oxygen monitoring system."
Overall good but the app LACKS an OVERVIEW of CALORINE INTAKE vs. CALORINE BURNT. An easy dashboard that can inform you if you have deficite (weight loss) or surplus.
Doesn't keep track of my steps anymore. Seems like you have to have to app open constantly for it to track your steps. Never use to be like that
"App has completely stopped working on S23. Their NEW phone lol. Now all i get is a ""cant open app"" message. Even after all the updates. sigh"
It's a good app but recently all the sudden stopped giving me my step count in the notifications. What's to send an avenue notification if it's literally just going to tell me what app I'm using?
Not sure if it's the app or the Samsung watch (galaxy 5) . But I was working on my computer but it said I was light sleeping. Not 100% trustworthy. Pls fix your sleep detection accuracy! Misleading sleep data can be detrimental to one's health .
"The app claims I can go in and edit the sleep it thinks it tracked. However, when I take a look at the app in the morning and notice that it thinks I got a nap before I got in bed just because I sat still long enough to watch an episode of a show or two, I run into a problem. If I try to edit that, it won't let me. I cannot just remove that one chunk of pretend sleep; I would have to delete all of the sleep it tracked for that night and lose all sleep stage details for the actual time I slept."
It would be a great improvement to add the option for barcode scanning for tracking calories.
Deceiving app allows you to download to Chromebook tablet but it does not tell you until once it is downloaded that it needs a SIM card to function. It is not okay it should work that way also if the tablet is connected to Hotspot from your phone it should automatically work I do not recommend.
"We WANT water in-take HOME SCREEN WIDGET (with -/+ symbols), just the same as Sleep widget. I'm waiting for this widget since 2 years. Hope you'll add this widget, Thank You Samsung team!"
"I love this app but FITNESS exercises is STILL a TOTAL mess up. I sent e-mail as proof to developer who did not respond to date, since 24-10-2022. I clear app Cache, drop exercises, reschedule, suddenly exercises stop every few sec/min. One exercise becomes up to 6 or 7 of 1 - 3 min each. Every EXERCISE MULTIPLY DAILY & THE EXERCISE DO NOT CONCLUDE, then do not show that I completed the exercise for the day & on my APP exercise stats shows multiple circuit training, please help?"
"Dev team, good work on exec, I've used the app for the last 6 years or so with different phones and it works well on the Android OS but recently I've been getting perpetual session expired notifs on my smartwatch Galaxy 3 but it's all good on the app on my OnePlus 6T android 11, investigate this bug üêõ I'm not sure if this is an isolated issue but it's affecting my device all of a sudden this could potentially spread to other devices, perhaps a patch or feature enhancement causing a regression"
Every time there is an update it messes up the step counter. Walked over 2000 steps and it shows zero.
Step count doesn't seemed to be correct. After 2km walk ( phone in my pants pocket registered 12xx steps. Installed another step counter and it shows the correct 28xx steps.
"Update: thank you to the developers - the problem seems to be fixed now ( see comment below). This is a very helpful app, but since the last update, edits to sleep time are not being saved. I have edited an inaccurate sleep time, and saved it, four times, and it has not changed. Please fix this problem."
"Huge amount of bugs related to Health Connect (disappearing workouts, wrong timezone conversion on imported sleep). Run distance is up to 10% off from GPS calculated by Strava and there is no way to edit. No ability to export data (download button is broken). No web version. No API anymore."
Disappointed It could have been an exciting upgrade from my last smartwatch and old app. Some functions are not supported on my phone ( Pixel 6 just 1 year old) I am not ready for another new phone for some time and would have expected that the watch and app would work with more than just Samsung phones.
"I'm using it for years and I'm happy with it. But recently the APP is not showing my old records in the annual views and I cannot get help from anywhere to fix it and retrieve my data, or seem them in the reports with annual view. !!!"
"It's so frustrating, almost to a point where I wanna throw my watch off the the window. It doesn't work sometimes. Doesn't sync data, ask for sharing data with third party apps all the time. Damn I am so frustrated. Atleast apple cares about privacy."
"When using Fitness programs together with galaxy watch experience is terrible-constantly Pausing workouts, sometimes for some reason workouts just keep Repeating, Can't search workouts based on what kind of Accessories I want to use, Forward doesn't work. Doesn't hawe Web interface, can't easily sync to google fit. All together it is a bad experience using this app. If someone is considering using Fitness tutorials to workout, easier, better experience is just to use YouTube"
"Love the app, but I am frustrated that there is no continuous heart rate graph. This is the first smartwatch and app I have had without the continuous heart rate feature. It is a major miss."
Myself & partner walk together but his Samsung health app says he's done more steps than me. I don't understand. Other than that it's ok. I like how you can enter your daily food intake.
"I love this app but theres loads of improvement to be made. I cant accurately track my hot yoga/pilates/bar classes. So I go back in after and add in another [fake] workout manually in order to log my calories that I've actually burnt. Which also logs incorrect information cause I'm adding time in for workouts I actually didn't do. I am grateful it syncs to Lifesum tracker, but there is confliction on what my nutrition should be. I feel partnering w. More apps allowing syncing is more optimal"
"Nutrition information calculation is wrong. Every day the nutrient intake percentages are incorrect. For example, my breakfast this morning had 127.3 carbs, 10g of fat, and 21.2 g of protein. But the ""Nutrient Intake Summary"" bar shows the wrong percentages! It says 75% carbs, 13% fat, and 12% protein. It's not even close to the actual values, which are 80%, 6.3%, and 13.4%. This needs to be fixed. Rest of app is pretty good - sleep tracking, workout tracking, etc."
"The functionalities are similar to Garmin's and look slightly better than Huawei's. The downside is the huge battery consumption for no good reason. Even after disabling all permissions except phone and tuning off activity tracking, location, etc., even with the Galaxy watch disconnected (which makes some more options appear) it still takes up over 40-50% of the battery use, effectively halving the battery life of my phone."
"Updated to 4 star, appears that the problem with sleep time entries has been fixed. However, the steps tracker still doesn't announce the 1/2 mile times correctly. It drops the "".5"" from the distance. Overall this is a good app!"
"TL;DR: full of bugs. Constantly on infinite loading loops with no information to user. Excersice view opens into epoch 0 time (1.1.1970) and only option to change date is scrolling. Changing date in sleep view doesn't do anything, unable to tell which date the data is from. Data syncing to Galaxy watch 4 works sometimes if ever. Just an unusable app."
"It doesn't reliably count my steps on my Samsung Watch. I don't know if it uses location, or arm movement, or what, but I can be walking back and forth across a room for an hour, and it tells me that I've been sitting, and need to get up and move. I haven't had this problem with fitness tracker apps."
"I recently upgraded my phone from the Samsung Galaxy S10+ to the Samsung Galaxy S22+, and can no longer use the heart rate or stress functions on the app. Edit: I posted this June 30th and have not received an answer like other people have. Is this problem is going to be fixed any time soon? The pulse oximeter function was very useful to me during this pandemic, and now it's gone."
Since the device update which included a update for the health app the recording of distance and speed etc. Is incorrect and inconsistent for the same time and distance... when previously it was consistent. Also there is no option to calibrate sensors to fix this.
I like the app and how it's setup. It definitely needs more workout options and I wish I could save more custom foods for tracking. It's a little inconvenient to have to keep deleting to create new foods.
"Worked great with my BT7000 blood pressure cuff on my old S9+, BUT now I have upgraded to the Samsung S21 Ultra 5g, and NOW IT WON'T SYNC WITH THE BT7000!!! I bought the BT700 because the Samsung health app worked with it, but once I upgraded my phone it doesn't work with the BT700 anymore, even though the BT7000 is included in the in-app adds! Why? When is it going to be fixed?"
"I love everything about the app except it doesn't pick up the steps I take. I've tried updating my phone, no luck. I a also bought Samsung watch for this purpose, it's not picking up steps up on that either. I just recently had surgery where I need to track my steps daily, so it's been frustrating. Any suggestions would be great."
"The app is great for tracking, but I wish it had actual workout plans. Most of them are not for muscle and strength training in a gym setting. I would give it 5 stars if it allowed people to tailor like a workout plan with timers for each excercise and to pick that custom set of workouts to do but I realize this may not be what the devs had in mind for their app."
"Removed ability to add devices like the speed device on my bike, can no longer connect to my Huawei watch 2. Older version would let me use both to track fitness and log data for cycle rides. Now it can't find them and when you look for blutooth devices won't find anything in app(but the phone will??)"
"Annoying bugs, still not fixed. I keep updating which exercises I want displayed in the app and it cannot sync to my watch. The list on my phone app should match what is show on my watch and it does not. I am not a swimmer, nor am I a runmer, and my watch app will not update this, no matter what I do. Such a bummer, could be great..."
"After a recent update when trying to use Samsung Health app it asks for this permission in settings: ""Phone: used to read your phone number so that people who have this number in the contacts can find you in Together. "" I don't use Together so I don't want to give Samsung permission to read my phone number. But if I don't agree I am unable to use the app. Which also makes my Galaxy watch worthless. I own a Galaxy 21 Ultra phone and this will be my last one. I am done with Samsung."
"The order of sleep rem light deep is incorrect. It should be light deep then rem. In the sleep section, when you took a nap a second clock woud appear for the second 12 hours of the day. At the moment when i take a nap it overlays the previos night sleep. It looks really bad and confusing. Please bring the second clock back permanently that allows you to see 2 12 hour segnments of time."
"There is no way to give data share permissions to other apps. When I try to give data permissions to share data with Samsung Health, and after trying with 2 different apps (AOK Bonus-App and FITINDEX) they tell me that Samsung Health is not allowing all the data access permissions. Even trying to give data access manually in the Samsung Health app is impossible. This is really bad! You need to fix this!"
"Have edited my review to 5 stars. Had a speedy reply which helped and now it's working fine. Sleep recording not accurate. Every night it shows me as in deep sleep at the very start of the sleep cycle, which is when I'm trying to fall asleep, so my deep sleep count is wrong. This is the only thing I don't like but it is very annoying."
"After updating the app recently now my sleep tracking is way off! Like this morning at 5am I was checking my sleep tracking with the app, and it said that I was asleep from 7am-11pm today and that time had not even come yet! It does this every day since updating the app. And I have gone through all my settings and nothing is different that I can see. I have no clue how to fix this so annoying"
"I love this app. The only thing that kinda triggers me is that I can't connect my new smartwatch to the app (ID208 BT), since the smartwatch can track all my exercises when I don't have my phone on me the steps aren't always that accurate. But overall a great app !!"
"I am writing this review after using this app, there are some issues -While walking if you got any call or use any audio/ video app, this app stops counting steps... experience it many times... -Sometimes it get paused, and doesn't start if you restart it. I countinue to walk, app stops counting steps in middle"
"I like the app, easy to use/navigate. I wish we could scan in barcodes, have more options to choose from (ounces, grams, etc) and able to enter (manually) serving sizes for calorie and water intake."
Works great on my phone and watch but will not work on my Samsung TV for some reason. Have contacted support and tried everything to get the fitness videos to play but still won't work. Always comes up temporary server error. Have tried everything and can't make any sense of it.
Love this app but it's been glitchy lately! It auto paused during my workout. I make sure to turn off anything that might interfere with it tracking me. Please look into this. I'm so tempted to find another app. It's done this multiple times before.
Why can't the food tracker also be set to do carb counting as so many people around the world does low carb and keto intermittent fasting and more. Also Why remove the O2 Sensor and ability to track from Note 10 plus 5G ?? Like it's supposed to be the most loaded and I have lung issues so this once helped now you have messed the app up once again. To line pockets I'm sure.
"Keeps Crashing!!! Originally the app worked great!! I loved it, but as of October 12th 2022 it suddenly stopped working. Tried updating, reinstalling, restarting multiple times with the same result. Samsung health just keeps stopping."
"Previously I would have rated this app highly, at least for weight recording. Recent updates have put it back. Might I suggest better UX testing going forward. The chart axis goes from 60 lb to 202 lb over a week in my case so is clearly of no value. Set the axis according to max /min of range The is clear error in max/min/averages too. Average for month shows 90 lb but real average is over twice this . Please test better going before releasing"
"Can't sign in to my account anymore because I changed my phone number. And I can't change the phone number to a new one because Samsung keeps sendind verification texts to the old number. Can't contact support because it, again, keeps sending textx to an old number. Absolute bulls**t! Another reason not to ever again have anything from Samsung. Luckily contract is running out and I'm switching to Pixel"
"Hello team the app is great. As a user i would love to see a new feature added. Medicine tracker. The MVP could be like a curated reminder list in which user can add the name of the medicine, type of the medicine, dosage timing and days. And set reminder for them. On reaching the specific time the reminder should trigger. Just a suggestion think about it :). Great app love to see more features."
"Really good interface. I used this app for counting my daily steps, it even counts when i am drivingüòÑ. Moreover, even tried pausing it for a whole day and started before my walk, it shows 2 km more than the actual distance covered on foot."
"Best fitness app i ever used, comes free with samsung mobiles. I liked its auto step count and auto pause features. I started running 10 kms first time in my life with the help of samsung health app 10 km program. Request developers to add more running programms like half and full marathon."
"Repeating my request for the food logging feature of this app allow for scanning nutrition labels. A lot of the pre-loaded info provided by ""FatSecret"" is missing the nutritional info. It is otherwise a good app and it's nice to have everything in one place, fitness, food, sleep, etc."
I cannot pause the step count with the current update. When I press the 3 dot button (which previously showed the pause step option) there is no option for me to pause my steps. I can't get an accurate reading if the steps also counts my driving distances.
"The ""together"" monthly challenge are completely bogus. The app sets a number of steps challenge for you to walk in one month. December challenge is 200,000 steps. There is no way people can be done in one day!!! Last month 500,000 steps people were done in 2 days. There is absolutely no way. I know there are some teams but there is no way in 24 hours it's completed."
"Updates: Hi, you have advised to seek help in Samsung Members app,but Play store shows that I cannot access that app on my device (it's not Samsung). Help required: Hi,I have updated the app,but could not Sign In. Removed the app and re-loaded again,but same thing: the blue and green dots keep on rotating for long after I hit Sign In without giving me an option to enter my credentials. What do I do please?"
"It's great, it's really helping me lose weight. One thing I would change though is adding average burned calories to the weekly summary. But other than that, it's really easy to keep track of your calorie intake and as long as I burn 300-800 more calories than my recommended intake, I'm losing weight at a healthy rate. I would just like to see that in my weekly summary."
"In the sleep section, it appears that ""Edit"" function allows only deleting but not real editing. For example, how can I edit out certain time windows that I know for sure I was not in sleep but my Samsung watch4 and this App recorded as if I was in sleep??? My previous Fitbits allowed me to edit out!!!"
"I purchased the Galaxy Watch 5 and love how this app syncs everything in one place. I gave it a four star because there are two things I would like to see added to make it fully functional. 1) Tracking meals ‚Äì I would like to see the barcode added to the app. Currently, you have to type every single meal; this is time-consuming. 2) Health Connect ‚Äì I noticed that users could not synchronize their Samsung Health steps data via Health Connect. I hope that the developer includes this in the future."
Womans health stopped working on my watch it just says to turn it on in the phone. It always worked before but there is no way to turn it back on or contact the company. For such a huge company as Samsung that's ridiculous to have technological failure and no way to fix it.
"I really like this app, however I would like to be able to add more than one sleeping period. For example, I often take 1-2 hour naps during the day but I cannot add those, and it messes up my statistics, which is really annoying. But other than that I really like this app"
Incredible app for anything health/fitness related. Even has fun little challenges you can do with your friends or compete globally against others to see who walks the most steps. I would give this 5 stars if it weren't for the cheaters at the top of the leaderboards with more steps than a human can physically achieve per day. If anyone from the Samsung team can address this issue it would be greatly appreciated.
"Liked this app very much but the latest update has removed the personal ""gold crown"" self challenge which was most enjoyable and made me want to reach the crown, shame - otherwise 5 star. Just located the "" self challenge "" feature which has been moved from it's previous position within the app , all is now excellent, back to 5 star for me."
"You can't complete the install and use this app unless you allow Samsung Health access to your contacts. So, if like me, you bought a Gear Fit2 and want to use it, you must acquiesce to this demand. There is no valid reason to grant blanket permission to a health app, to collect my contact list info. That is not a feature, it is an intrusion. The sharing of contacts should be optional. Screw you, Samsung. Plenty of other options out there, so into the trash with the Gear Fit 2, abd your app."
"The only thing this app does is track my steps. And, who knows how accurate that is. It will occasionally provides my heart rate and stress level but not even on a daily basis. Today is the 20th and the last reading was on the 13th. It quit tracking my sleep a long time ago."
As usual Samsung keeps screwing their own apps. You can no longer edit the sleep duration... But the app is too buggy to submit a bug request... Original: Getting worst and worst. Last version disabled the option to activate developer mode so now an 3rd party app I was using to sync sport activities between apps doesn't work anymore... Yey.... And yes that app developer requested to be added to shealth partner apps and nothing....
"App is entirely broken: - Steps continuously attempting but unable to sync steps from watch, steps screen loads a bugged layout with no data - Food seems to open correctly but continuously attempts to unsuccessfully load past data and unable to search food items - Daily Activity, Exercise, Heart Rate, Blood Pressure, Body Composition all open to black screens, nothing loads Entire experience (wearable app and watch plugin are also broken) is just pathetic for the official Samsung apps."
I like the app and how it offers workouts. However it is hard to comb through the workout on what I want. There needs to be a search button for the workouts so they are easier to find.
"I only use this app occasionally, my watch tracks my steps and I check it once in a while in the app, other than that I only really use the stress monitor. Now it wants 2 step authentication to ""challenge friends"". Get rid of this or add in an opt out and I'll change to 5 star."
"Data Issues! When I first brought the watch online, it sync'd data between the watch and app, perfectly. Now everything but the BP is sync'd which is annoying me as I have to enter these figures manually. Does anyone have any ideas? Thank you in advance."
"Bought an S21 ultra at Bestbuy and was told the heart monitor was on the device. Had an S10 and that had the monitor. Went to use this app, and the hardware is not available on the S21 Ultra. I am not happy with Best Buy or Samsung about this. I cannot wear a smartwatch due to metal allergies, so the phone was an awesome idea. May have to look at other phone brands when I go to change phones again."
"Update: Thanks for fixing this! The weight tracking no longer let's me choose if I want to view my weight over a week, month, etc. or what my minimum, maximum, and average weight is in a given time period.. Please bring back these features. Why get rid of something that was helpful???"
"For as much as Samsung charges for their smart watch this app is a bummer. App is dated, lacks so much data that is expected to be viewable. Fitbit and Garmin both blow this out of the water. Devs: integrate the wearable and health monitor app so that I don't need 3 apps to support my lousy smart watch."
"Love the app thus far! Convenient fitness stats, one wish I have is exercise heart rate specific data per week/daily i.e. time spent in x heart rate zone on Monday vs Tuesday and week/month of during x exercise & cumulative & V02 info for all cardio. (I've gotten the discipline down & am trying to track intensity progress). Perhaps more educational articles on nutrition & or exercise suggestions for ideal body composition changes or mental health support. Perhaps even fasting tracking?"
"It no longer senses when I'm actively walking to track my steps. Now I have to start a workout in order for it to capture the steps. This app initially was great when you could measure V02, etc. Now it's at a point of being useless. I'm trying to track my activity but now I'm considering other options."
"The new update has been giving me inaccurate figures especially when I run, the app usually told me when it's 1km and that was accurate, now my 1km stretches upto my 2km peg, and that is draining especially if you're looking to be consistent and improve on your distance, please work that..."
"It has been two years since I started to use this app specially watch 3. It gives me the patience and energy to regularly be more active & exercise more. Specially, the part that compares once performances with friends, similar age and total users. I was keen to keep my position among total users and my age group. But the current update removed the part for all users and global similar age users. It only gives comparison among friends. This needs to be amended. The updates with sleep are great"
GPS tracking of walk/hike stopped working. It used to work (and calculate VO2 Max but GPS won't lock since last update. HR monitor in unreliable at HR > 150. This may be an issue with the watch rather than the app but got worse with the September 2022 update.
It's a good app but recently the run tracking has decided that I'm The Flash as I managed to walk a mile in 22 seconds. It's routinely adding half a mile for no reason. Would definitely like that corrected if possible.
"Good app to use to keep track of calories and exercise , only problem is that as a Singaporean who eats Asian food there is a huge lack of food options to track down . they should add more options based on the location of where the user is"
"I've been loving this app until about 2 weeks ago when it stopped tracking my sleep properly. Shows that I am asleep from 4am to 12 pm and all sorts of crazy sleep sessions, but I am actually awake during those times. This app keeps getting worse and worse. Now today, it won't update my sleep from my watch 3 no matter what. What is going on???"
"Newest update is broken. The mandatory 2 step verification won't actually go through, so you can't set it up, and you can't use the app without it. Way to render your entire app USELESS. Please fix it! Update Nov 14, 2022: still broken. Still useless. Your two step verification destroyed a perfectly good product. Don't just tell me to call someone or give useless instructions either. Fix your product."
Since the last update my steps between my watch and smasun health on my phone has been so bad. I have Samsung watch and seems like my steps don't count properly when I run. It shows I did 6000 steps while running or the treadmill but it comes up only 4000 in my total steps. It is big difference.
"I really like this app for tracking health items. You can track your activity info. by type running, aerobics, weight lifting, etc... You can add in your daily food and track some nutrition and vitamin info. Also tracks water intake, sleep, blood pressure, etc... I would like to see more in the nutritional breakdown of food. For instance, it doesn't track daily vitamin D or daily B12 intake, both very important! Also, helpful if it reported your nutritional deficiencies at least weekly."
"Great app for tracking exercise, water intake, it's not great for tracking calories (I use my fitness pal for that). The new snore detection is a good idea but probably impossible to be accurate if your spouse snores. It's registering his snoring as me."
Last version of Samsung Health was incorrectly saving input for sleep. I contacted the developer and a new version was released and installed. Seems to have fixed the issue. Fast work. Thanks!
Please get rid of the bar graph for heart rate data and give us back the point graph. I absolutely hate the bar graph.
Coaching and insights has disappeared. Would be nice to have it back. Also nice if insights on calorie intake/nutrition was introduced?
"This app sucks. I got a Samsung Galaxy Watch 5, and the sleep detection is not accurate on this app and I cannot even adjust it. I have to dig to get to the stats I want, such as my resting heart rate and total calories burned, and I cannot adjust my basal rate either. This is not even close to par with the Fitbit app."
App use to work great but half the time it won't record my sleep or it will glitch and show the wrong times. Not sure what's happened here but it's a tad aggravating. I've tried Uninstalling and reinstalling the app with no success.
"For some weeks now, I can't modify the sleeping time, it gives me some error (when the watch is not recording ok, for example I'm awake 1h but it records that I was sleeping... and I want to modify this) - as I could some previous versions."
In this day and age a health app that connects to a watch should have a BP scanner. It's ridiculous that Samsung can't have one in the USA.
"I use this app daily for sleep tracking, hiking and biking. I just wish I could access the information from my PC."
There is a serious bug in the app. The steps gets counted when in auto or bus particularly in patchy or rural roads
"Good app in general, using the new Samsung galaxy 5 Pro watch, it only records resting heart rate every 3 or 4 days, compared to My galaxy watch 3 which did so every day."
"App has lots of usable features but not stable. I have lost data from ky Watch 4 on 3 occasions simply because it wouldn't sync as the login session has expired and there is no other option to login again as it loads for eternity with no progress. You are forced to lose all the unsynced data, even though the data from the watch is synced with the app."
"Why thw app would need access to my contacts and so many other stuff, and if you dont accept you cant use it, even if I dont see the need for the app to work."
"Samsung took the heart monitor away, a life-saving part of the app. This monitor saved my life. When I compared it to my mom's machine, it had a 3 bpms difference, 97% accurate. Shame on you, Samsung."
"Very useful app, helps me keep track of my calories intake , workout plans and much more."
"I like this app. I downloaded it to my phone. It records my steps for a few days, then stops recording for a couple days. No idea why?"
"Yesterday, my father and I ran ""5"" miles and I got them done but he got 7 with the SAME APP!!!! I have been having this problem and it's getting annoying,please fix this."
"It was working fine until last update. Now, no notifications, and they are on. Can't see my steps either"
I have used this app for about 5 years and have loved it up until the recent changes. I uninstalled and am looking for another. Under no circumstances should I have to give permission for this app to use any of my phone information to use the app. That is nonsense and an invasion of my privacy. I can provide them with information they NEED to know. They do not NEED my contact information. There is no excuse that can be given by customer service that will make this ok. Samsung not acceptable!
"Fairly good, but for an app from Samsung, I was expecting more. Sleep monitoring for example is pretty poor, doesn't even monitor heart rate during sleep (don't even know how it tracks REM without this). Other apps like Zepp Life have way more features and analytics. Showing tips and health material isn't something really interesting to me, this app should use more technology instead..."
App works well. Wish list item: I want my other workouts to count towards my daily steps. Other apps make the conversion!
Broken With Last Update Feb 2023. Won't load even after factory reset. Tried everything Authorized tech and tech support couldn't solve. Told me to wait for the next update. NEW PHONE S23.
"Love this app, use it daily to track steps, exercise, calories, and sleep. With my watch it's a perfect activity tracker that was built into my phone. Have been using it for years and will continue to use it for the foreseeable future."
"I used to like this app until the app required to read my phone number. I can't use the app if I don't give this permission, so I just uninstall it."
Hi Samsung even tho this is a great app. I have a glitch.. it pauses my workouts every few minutes.. I did everything to solve this problem.. it really makes me lose my momentum.. and I really want to keep this app and continue recording my workouts
So I'm confused as to how I'm only averaging 18k steps a day when I have done over 203k steps since the beginning of this month. It doesn't add up.
"I quite like the app for calorie counting. Works well on my phone, but displaying the data on a non-Samsung tablet is not possible (asks for Sim Card). Also not possible to see the data in a nice format on a website or PC."
"I like how it records my sleep but it has an edit button that I cannot edit. There should at least be a slider for me to choose start and stop actual sleep time so I can delete what's recorded when watching nightly movies. Not sleeping, or talking to my husband in the morning not sleeping. Those shoukd not ge added to my sleep time saying I slept 15 hours! Please fix the edit option."
"I live in Canada. My sister bought galaxy watch 5 in South Korea and broght it to Canada for me. The watch has blood pressure and ECG, but this app does not. Please, help me use the funtions."
"Eversonce the latest update my app doesn't know how to measure anything anymore. Walking, cycling, running: distance calories elevation... nothing...."
"Absolutely trash, has stopped tracking my steps for the last 2 days. Cleared cache, force closed app restarted phone nothing works except installing again which is unacceptable for a $1800 foldable. An iPhone is looking like my near future or Google device."
"This new app is pure garbage. Between samsung, removing the heart rate monitor, and 02 sensors on the new phones whith out telling anyone and disabling these fetcher on the old phone if you update the app. Im really disappointed in samsung latest changes. I DONT KNOW IF I WILL BUY ANOTHER SAMSUNG PHONE. they are removing all the feature i use. The heart monitor, the sd card. The headphones jack the oculus head set. The charger. You get a phone with lest feature for more money. S7 was the best"
Sleep health is fickle and a little difficult to work. Needs more simplicity and ease of use. Before you reply to follow the instructions on the app they too need work. Research on it is the best way to go until samsung makes a few needed changes.
The app is very easy to use but please add a cardio option and indoor walk option.!!!
"Used to have more with this app like being able to measure heart rate, and stress levels which seem to have disappeared, and have to rely on my watch to record levels now, it's basically becoming just a record of what my watch registered ü§î"
"It was great until I bought a new phone. Now I can't even record my BP, HR, O2 without buying a watch. I check often with external devices and record it myself. Can't add to the app anymore. Since I'm in a wheelchair none of the exercises work for me so this app now is a waste other than weight and food. If you fix these manual input functions, you have my email Samsung so contact me, I don't plan on going through the long customer service delays unless you contact me first by email."
2FA never sends code. Every time I put in my mobile number the timer starts ticking and even if I extend the time the code never comes. I've tried numerous times over the last 3 months. Recently had to reinstall and now I need to log in to connect my device (previously it was still connected) but still no luck. Help me.
You don't have the option to put stone and pounds in the weight setting. We use this measure in the UK and probably other countries
"Worse with Since very update! Latest version I cannot use this app. All I get is a notification saying, signed out, however cannot sign in."
Inaccurate. I walked for 5 kilometres in the morning app showing 856 steps how that is possible. All there parameters also inaccurate and wrongly measured.
1. Weight won't update. 2. Weigh target can only be set for a max of 8 weeks. 3. You can't rearrange the order of the things you're tracking. Really disappointed that this hasn't improved!
"As a long-time Samsung user amongst a sea of overzealous iPhone proselytizers, I've dealt with the iOS/Android debate countless times. I've been pressed to evaluate the pros & cons of each platform way too many times. While I happily admit that each platform has its own strengths & weaknesses (and Android & Samsung have their fair share of weaknesses vis-√†-vis iOS & iPhone), one of the few things keeping me committed to Samsung is this app & its great tracking when coupled with my Samsung Watch."
"All round good app. Would be really helpful if there was a barcode scanner for easier logging of food eaten. (Unless there is one, but I just haven't found it!)"
"Wish it had barcode scanner like Fitbit app. Pretty good app, my Galaxy watch 4 seems more accurate than my Fitbit so I switched over, one thing I miss though is the option to scan food barcode to get calorie information, if Samsung added that it would help improve the app."
"Nice app, I Just think you can add a search button, to ge able to search trough category, like punch ups, ab, legs... and also filter if we need equipment or not ... I would like also to share some exercises but there's no sharing option... you should add too"
"I like this app. It seems to works just fine. I have two galaxy watches (Watch 5 and Watch 5 Pro). Why is it that the sleep tracking info doesn't show up on the 2nd watch too? Is the app not able to tell if you have more than one watch? I can view the info on the app from the phone, but if I switched watches it doesn't show my sleep tracking stats on that 2nd watch....Why? I have two Apple watches and apple allows you to see the same info on both."
"Not all exercise data is syncing with Google fit, lifesum, etc. I see steps, and even a treadmill exercise, but the other types of exercise that I use on my watch5 are not syncing. It was working before, maybe the last update broke something?"
This is is garage. Can't do ECG always get error and can't measure BMI keeps saying don't touch your hand. Apple Watch is so much better and accurate.
"Can't manually add missed steps. Walked around Costco for 2 hours, 17 steps recorded and cannot manually add actual steps (can add exercise duration but not step counts)"
Everything works great. I would like it to measure my oxygen the whole time I sleep and give me data on how long I am at certain levels. It does state how low you go but not for how long. Can there be an update for that? Love the distance tracker and the route tracker and all that...is awesome.
"Galaxy watch 4 now has a add on that auto detects a non Samsung Android phone, this enables you to reply to texts properly, no prefixed replies like other watches, this is by far the best watch and the app has so many easy to use options, so glad that Samsung decided to patch this watch for full use on other android phones."
Excellent. üá≥üáµ Sleep time report is not detail. Can not select proper time reports. Please fix the issue in next update.
I like this app. I wish it also displayed Total Burned Calories on a widget though. It would help me evaluate my deficit better.
"Would love to give it more stars. But for some reason the tracking of calories burned changed to about half on my excersise bike rides. 70 minute ride use to be over 1000 calories. Now it changed to around 550 for same ride. Use several other fitness trackers and the bike has a built in one. This one is half of the others now. Use to be 75 calories every five minutes , now it is about 38 every five minutes. Don't like whatever happened to the app ."
"the app now wont backup women's health data??? it'll continue to backup other datas but womens it wont save anything, and the worst is NO REASON at all ???????"
"Update: so when are we brining back weight management widget no one supposedly wanted but everyone complained you got rid of? Old post: This app, coupled with some other workouts, helped me loose 25 pounds since the beginning of this year thanks to the weight management function. The most recent update got rid of the function."
Where's the gps map gone after a run or walk loved the fact I could review a walk or hike I've recorded since the last update the map is no longer showing in the app .....why ?
WILL NOT work on a Samsung S23 ultra. Cleared Cache. Reinstalled. Refuses to work. Phone provider state its an app fault ????
I love the application and it is really excellent. The only downside for me is that although it can pick up my motion I would really want to be able to set through my watch to remind me if I was sitting for 30 minutez in order for me to do stretches. This is more imporant for my health because of all the office jobs affecting our health more
"Very insidious and way too aggressive. When installing the app one of the options are: Personalise Samsung health, but if you view the details this is about sharing your data with third parties. It asks twice if you want to enable 2fa but if you say no it won't let you use the app. The second time you see this, the title is about 2fa but the text is about connecting with my friends. The language is misleading. Samsung: do not tell me to contact customer service in reply to this."
"Not sure what time zone my app is in, but it's not the same time zone as me. At first, it was an hour ahead, now it is 8 hours ahead. It is tracking the length of sleep, but definitely not the right time stamp on the west coast. It's been off for over a week now and I assumed the last update corrected this but it hasn't."
Samsungtook away all the great features I suppose to try to force us to buy a smart watch. I'm sorry I upgraded my phone.
"My app updated a few days ago and my miles tracker is no longer tracking my laps or time properly. Prior to the update, I did not have any issues. I use the miles tracker between 5 and 6 days a week. I am not a happy camper!"
Good but loosing features. What happened to the fitness programs? The tab is there but it is empty... is this a glitch Samsung?
"I HATE the new up grade and the last one. The current speed is almost never right from the last upgrade and the new one wont let you post a pick of your route, it will only post a pick of a black women running or its a black man with a man bun either way it sucks and now the voice that gives you info every mile on your time, current speed, average speed and estimated finish time is said so fast that you can hardly catch what she says. I use to love this app you've made it worse every time"
"I purchased a Samsung Watch for the health app, primarily the sleep. Two or three days after getting the watch and my app updates and I lose the breakdown of my sleep cycle. This is why I bought the watch. Bring back the sleep chart and I will give this app a 5 Star rating. I love everything about it but the sleep chart is actually the most important part to me"
Randomly fails to record route information and today recorded ten steps for a walk that took over an hour to complete.
"Sleep tracker is the only thing I use and before it used to be that when I edit the sleep time, the slider would automatically be stopped at the current time. Now it moves freely and throws an error ""time cannot be in the future"""
"I used to like this app because I could track my calories, sleep, exercise and period all in the one place. I would use lifesum for food intake and sync to Samsung, but that feature hasn't worked for months. It either tracks double what my input is or doesn't sync at all, making all my weekly progress reports inaccurate and basically useless. Ended up uninstalling because of it."
"Great way to count your steps. Also, great way to count your water intake every day. Can also track your calories from what you eat every day, your sleep, & also log your weight everyday! And if you're a female, you can keep track of your period too! Highly satisfied w/this free app that came on my phone!!!"
"After the previous update, I noticed a technical bug and reached out to Samsung Health via Samsung Members app on my Samsung A52 smartphone. The Samsung team responded swiftly and said that an update with the bug fix will be released. Lo & behold! Here it is! Good job, Samsung team! Thank you for your response! A suggestion: Can you look into possibly including the 'Daily Water Intake' in the weekly summary: no need to compare to other Samsung Health users; just a user's personal average?"
"Do not buy Galaxy watch. App does'nt work with non Samsung phone. Can't login with error ""iam.ETC.Common.Browser.not.supported.Error.Message""."
This app keeps giving me heart rate information for the wrong gender. There should be an option to view both genders via a drop down list.
"Today, 15/3, the program can't display my step in 14/3. Only the graphic. I don't know why. The foot step at 15/3 is okay. I did screenshot for that problem."
Why suddenly my sleep data not recording ? Even I syncing hundred times. Checked my Samsung Galaxy fit2 is connected.
"This app has been draining my pixel 6pro as much as 20% overnight. And IT WONT STOP no matter what I do (delete cache, force stop, restrict battery use. You sign a lot of personal info away to them and the least one should expect is competence with both hardware and software. I will not be getting another Samsung watch when there are better options out there now."
"Doesn't work on devices with unlocked bootloader, even if not rooted, like mine. Why restrict users like that, and what are you so afraid of?"
Samsung health App.is not working from day 1 of my new phone. It is showing server error. Please help to resolve the issue.
The app is not counting my steps correctly I walked 4000 steps app says 2000 also sleep is not working correctly either there is no pedometer to tap I see walking so thos is still not working
"All of a sudden this app is constantly crashing even after updating it and restarting a few times, avoid"
Missing the HRT / Stress Option which sucks. I'm guessing less features on the phone pushes people towards spending yet more money on a watch. Bless capitalism.
This app is very basic at best and is very inconsistent. Sometimes it can detect when I'm running and most times it cannot. I would not recommend this app as a way to track your overall health and fitness.
"IT'S FIXED! After a week, the sleep time recording is finally working correctly again. (No longer off by an hour.) Thank you. üòé Will you, please, bring back the ""clock face"" to enter time... it was so much easier... in my opinion! ü§î P.S. Will the weekly ""reviews"" be fixed as well? And, will they start being sent every week, instead of here & there? ü§î"
I find Samsung Health very useful especially when paired with the Samsung Galaxy Watch. I enjoy tracking my health data on it.
"Samsung Galaxy phone with Galaxy Watch 4, regularly stops measuring speed and distance, although all permissions are given. Trying to clear cache, restart, etc, but it's not normal to start every workout with troubleshooting Samsung Health app!"
The best of the best. Samsung users it's a must. 4 stars because a lot of apps require sycning from Google fit and syncing Samsung health to Google fit is a hassle.
All I want to know is this just for use with Samsung Galaxy smartwatch? Because I do not own so I do not see the point in having this App in MY phone. It's taking up valuable space. I shall search via Google. To me It's just yet another useless Samsung Galaxy App.... And I'll uninstall. My life's not run by silly pointless Apps.
"The app is great, i have always liked it, and lately, it's been showing notifications, but there are no notifications. I'm not sure why it's doing that"
"The most recent update fixed the issue that I was having with the audible data while cycling, restoring my confidence in this app. I've used it for several years now, and overall I find it helpful and reliable."
"Sleep module on the companion phone app caught my cat snoring, and I've got the recording to prove it. He was horrified and made me promise not to post it on SM. But I guess it's not really the app's fault my cat snores."
"Overall I use this app a lot. Recently seeing an issue, where even if I record walking it creates one more walking auto in daily exercise history. It is probably a bug."
"Very annoying little up, unfortunately I have to use it as part of corporate fitness scheme for steps tracking."
"Good app, but the new update has lost the weight averages. I check my progress on my monthly / weekly average. Please bring this back asap Additional, can't record weight anymore, it doesnt show right away, please fix"
"I get that Samsung is trying to create their own apple like ecosystem but the blood pressure and EKG functions are not available on a non Samsung phone. It's a soft limitation, not a hard one as it is possible to side load it to make it work with other phones. You can't even attach it to a Samsung tablet period."
If this worked this would be wonderful It seemed to be counting my steps...buy now I do not believe it is accurate. One day I must have walked 2000 steps..but not counted Other times..it counts my morning steps about my apt..and other days when I have been moving about my Apt..it reports NO STEPS I would just like it to work..have not touched anything
Works great! I love all the details logs and stats! Looking forward to tracking my progress with this app. : )
"Cannot determine: oxygen in blood, heart rate, stress level without wearing Galaxy watch. I would like Not to wear one. And yet obtain Data of the 3 body functions! Is it possible??!! Thanks Today Oct 6th. the situation has NOT changed, still experiencing the same draw backs. Is there any thing I could do to enable me to determine the 3 body functions mentioned above,??!! At last I got the 800 number. Yes, you've to wear Galaxy Watch. WHEN can determine the 3 body functions WITHOUT WEARING one."
"Why on earth would I need to give this app permission to my phone number, or I can't use it?! It is stupidly asking for more information than needed from a sports app! Maybe I just want to track my steps, not others tracking my number!"
Excellent pair with galaxy wearable devices. it syncs information very well and accurate. The design looks simple and easy to use. No stabillity and connection issues so far.
"Following last update, the steps counter only works when the app is open. To see steps I have to force stop and clear cache on daily basis."
"I apologize for 2 stars, this is why 1)the app stop counting steps or freeze. 2) it doesn't automatically feel that I walk and sometimes I need to get into the app and check if it count the steps. 3)I am tired of cleaning the cache memory always. 4)I like it because I can use it with myfitnesspall. 5)I have an app that came with my phone, Huawei health and that count the steps always I never had a problem with it, somethomes I have 3000 steps on it and Samsung health just started counting."
Not working in pixel 6a running on Android 13 Unable to sign in. Not getting the prompt to enter username and password. Loading screen is always loading
"My app stopped counting steps over a week ago. I updated the app, cleared the cache and still not working."
It does not count steps properly. It started counting incorrectly after the last September update. Using non Samsung phone tested on 2 different phone brands). Please solve it.
"Really disappointed that the tracking map for walks and hikes stopped working last month. And for longer then that, exercises completed almost always record as ""unfinished"". PLEASE FIX THESE PROBLEMS ASAP"
"I'm trying to lose weight after my second child. The app is great to track calories and everything, however I wish there was a spot for postpartum/breastfeeding moms and for pregnancy. Breastfeeding/pumping can burn 500 to 700 calories a day and it would be more helpful to track that."
"When will you add pause button on Steps widget, it's been a year since I requested it also had it in Members #Inovation submission, still not added also water drank widget as well! When will you add those!?"
Problems with Pixel 7. Buffers and will not load. Sending back Samsung Galaxy 5 Pro watch because this app won't function on my phone.
"Since last update it has stopped showing steps in notifications! Why did they remove that? All it says is ""Samsung health started"""
"After latest watch update can no longer measure body composition. Just errors out at 80% every time even though m y hands are not touching and the watch is tight against my arm. Either says not to let my hands touch, which they aren't, or to make sure the watch is snug, which it is. Worked fine before when it only wanted 1 finger ....."
App NEVER accurately tracks auto detected workouts. Miscalculates speed and distance 5+ days per week.
"I've used this app for a few years to track workouts from my galaxy watch. Bafflingly, the latest update broke TIME ZONES, of all things! My phone and watch both know my time zone (Americas/New_York), but Samsung Health now doesn't, and will show GMT withing the app, roll over step counts at midnight GMT, not local, etc. This just a mind bogglingly simple mistake to make and speak to an utter lack of QA."
Last update is horrible ! I shouldn't have to go and reset settings I already had to get me step count back. Can't use half the categories.
I have just started on this app and I am impressed with what I have learned thus far I shall buy certain devices to improve my journey in improving my health.
"App is very good & i am enjoying it by using its services but it's also bit annoying me coz several times it didn't get updated while I walk or run, several time I noticed that I walked more than a km but it showing 200 or 300 Meters, how it can be like this after several updates. Pls fix this problem either I have to move some other app....if this problem get resolved then it's my promise I will update my review & stars."
"The sleep tracking in the most recent update does not allow me to set the start and end times, unless I first accept the automatic times and then edit them. Please fix.... The only reason for the 1 star rating is too hopefully get the developers attention this is most certainly a 5 star app."
"The app is good however, when logging in with a phone other than Samsung the process is hell and I don't recommend it to anyone who isn't using a Samsung phone"
"I updated the app and ever since it gets stuck while loading. I reinstalled it, restarted my phone, etc. without change. I used it previously for years with no problem. My phone is new and no problem with other apps"
"Oh yeah, now I remember why I first deleted this app! It demands my phone number and contact list just so I can do HEALTH things. I know you're going to copy paste the same excuse about app features, but why not give users a choice whether they want those? You won't because you neeeeed that sweet data to market [to] us. Free software = WE are the product."
"Absolutely love(d) the app. Always recommended it to people but 2023 broke the app and Fit2 sync. It is no longer tracking my steps in the gym, on the treadmill etc. I dont know what's going wrong. I have never had any issues with the sync with Galaxy Fit2 band but all of a sudden, it is no longer recording my steps on the app. The fit2 is showing the steps anyways. Happened since the new year rolled in. Help will be very appreciated."
The steps complication doesn't work at all with simple pixel watch face by Thema. Any chance this could be resolved?
"Installed to use with Galaxy Watch 5 pro. After dinner trouble logging on to the Samsung Health service because of unsupported browser issues, I was able to get on and it has worked like a charm ever since. All watch functions are supported on my non-Samsung phone."
"I can't imagine my life with this app, it's arranging all the activities I do and its really motivational."
"Sleep portion of the app is useless, even with Samsung's most recent wearable. Constant low sleep scores are based on apps inability to detect sleep from reading a book or watching TV."
As people have said. Things keep changing or stopping. Thinking of moving away to another platform. Not had any weekly updates since end of December. Its becoming too unreliable.
"Do you have an updated Samsung health version for Galaxy 4 watch? It works OK but the sleep is driving me crazy it got my sleep nice today but because I slept a little later it didn't add the extra time, and I couldn't replenish it. Sometimes it doesn't get the time at all. Thank you for your help in advance and I hope you have a nice day"
"Great stats, works well most of the time. I really enjoy the averages it gives."
Jog literally the same exact route every day but the app tells me it's a very different distance each time. Also being able to turn the voice off so it doesn't talk over the music I'm listening to
I can't get past the 2 spep verification I verified and was just in my email I got no other command so I clicked the back button and yeah I have to do it all over again
"Looks like some changes were attempted with the November update but still unable to reduce the number of hours or change the time that I wake up. It will not accept the ""wake"" time when I try to change it and still says ""cannot increase"" hours slept when I am actually trying to reduce the hours slept. Must I get out of bed and do jumping jacks so that you know I am awake?"
"Fails at recording workouts. I did a 40 minute intensive workout with an average heart rate of 160 bpm, with highs in the 190's. Not only did the app say I only burned 40 calories total, It wouldn't let me edit the workout. I try to hit 10k+ steps in a day and some days it'll say I walked 2 miles after 3 minutes of walking.. or halfway through it'll stop recording. So after an hour of walking no activity. Garbage app"
"I'm still trying to get my galaxy z fold 3 phone, and a galaxy watch 4 classic lte. With heart pressure monitors, how do I make the watch talk to the phone without it saying it will not work on a routed device. Please help it was th reason I got these devices. Many thanks Tony. England."
The app worked great on my galaxy s10 but now I have a galaxy fold 3 and the measure button for heart rate and stress are gone?!
I have a brand new Pixel 7 along with the Galaxy watch. 4 and I have uninstalled and installed Samsung Health several times trying to get it to work and all that happens is when it says login is just is thinking forever and will not log in. This is very frustrating and I'm not sure what else to do.
"Ok app needs a little tweek , would be great if you could turn the sleep tracking chart to landscape and run you finger over giving detailed time stamp rather than trying to work out a rough time from the bottom . Please have a look at this Samsung ."
Date now shows year as 1969. No longer syncing with my galaxy watch. Recent update should be removed
"This was my preferred health app, but for some reason Samsung now forbids other apps from sending it step data (I use a Fitbit). I'm not going to use multiple apps, so I will have to use Google Fit from now on. Samsung, please change this so I can use this app. It's not going to get me to buy your watch, it's just going to stop me from using the app. Bummer."
I use this app daily. Just changed my phone to an S9 and the app wont open. Tried returning phone to factory settings and removing and reinstalling. Very disappointed it was the only reason I stayed with Samsung
"Taking a trip somewhere? Well you can't use this app. ""Not available in your current location"" Samsung used to be good quality, now it's like Facebook. Stealing and selling your private info, telling you what you can't do with a watch you paid hundreds of dollars for."
"The sleep app will list times you are awake as being asleep, but will sometimes let you delete those times. But not always."
"Plus: - I liked the features it had like counting steps, type in food and drink and water/caffeine etc. - It tried to record sleep according to phone movement and suggested the time you slept. You just needed to confirm that or adjust the time manually. - You could start training/running and let the app record the time/distance etc. It provides everything you actually need and more. Minus: Needs lots of storage but that may be due to the many features. Lets Samsung collect a lot of data..."
"Extreme battery drain issues on Pixel 6 using close to 20% of the battery , also the sync is not up to date on the app. Edit : The update has fixed the issue , Thanks !"
Absolutely awful. Keeps turning on an alarm that I don't want. And the automated response is nonsense
This takes up so much storage. I've got 800mb in data alone. I empty cache regularly. There has to be a way to clean it up without deleting everything and starting over with my watch also. Sux. At least your BP works well. üòÜ
Features held hostage. When I bought this watch I didn't know that certain features were Samsung only even though they both run Android. Seems a little bit petty toward people who have a different phone than a Samsung! I really was interested to see the ECG feature with my Galaxy watch 4.
App worked since I got my phone back in 2021 but now it won't open. It just says an error message.
"This app was a crashing piece of garbage even with Watch 2 & 3, now I ordered the Watch 4 only to realize that it works 100% ONLY with Samsung phones. Who would in their right mind launch a Wear OS watch that is not 100% Android compatible?? What was the point to scrap Tizen if Wear OS fully supports only Samsung phones?? How is it possible that Android/Google approved this?"
"used this a lot with s9, for pulse, oxygen, stress, etc, but not available on a53, so will need to uninstall sadly. used to be good now useless for my needs"
I like the exercise tracking on this app but want to use Health Connect so it can sync data with other services. However exercises don't seem to sync and if they do it is a bit sporadic.
"App no longer displays bpm from Omron via Health api. Worked on my Note 8 which I just upgraded to Galaxy S22 Ultra. Data is there, I see it when I click on my Blood Pressure section but, it does not display in its own bpm section / tile. Useless now for charting bpm history and at a glance views. Besides the pbm there are other tiles that can no longer be used to add data manually. You need to do some review and testing. You broke a very good app and I'm holding off on buying a wrist type unit"
"Pretty good app for health tracking, especially with Galaxy Watch 5 Pro. Step sync to Health Connect seems broken currently."
"There is absolutely no reason this app should require me to allow ""make and manage phone calls."" I will not be using the app."
"Stopped working on android 13 Jan 23 update. Used my old android 12 phone but it Won't work without a SIM, what a joke. Looking for alternatives"
"Love this app, but it has completely stopped working. I even Uninstalled, reinstalled, new watch etc, still doesn't work üò´"
"It is gletching .It keeps telling me I have a message. When I open app ,there is no message."
"It's nice to see how much moving you can accomplish in a month. All the other tracking features are good as well. Wish I could remove some people from the ""friend"" list. I don't know most of them people and they are inactive."
Really good as a I got a Samsung smart watch Really wish there was more challenges to do with friends like fitbit As side from that it's a good app
"The updated version is the outdated version. While walking nearly 1.5km, still the app shows the same count as before. There is no change in the step count. It is the worst app like samsung."
"I have been enjoying the app, until the recent update. The sleep function will not record my sleep time as I input it into the app. It's always an hour behind after I click the save button."
"I used this app often over the past 6 years on my Galaxy S7 to monitor my heart rate and oxygen level, as well as to track my steps. On my Galaxy S21 there is no feature to check heart rate so now it's next to useless. Edit: per the reply, I'm eagerly looking forward to this update and will edit my review at that time."
App is fine for the most part but it doesn't allow me to edit my sleep times. Usually when I wake up I'll get on my phone for a bit but my watch doesn't register this as awake time and I have no way to correct it.
"They require access to your phone calls and then show your info to people who had listed you in their contact list. If you don't allow access, the app won't start."
"Worst app, i am trying from past few months to set up this app but unfortunately every time it is showing no internet connection."
"On my old samsung s10 this app worked. I have a new samsung s10, and the monitors don't work. I do like to keep track of it, and I can't. Please fix it. I have Uninstalled and reinstalled several times now."
"No, Samsung, THIS PHONE IS NOT ROOTED, SO STOP REFUSING TO RUN CERTAIN FUNCTIONS OF THIS APP BECAUSE I'M ON A PHONE YOU WRONGLY FLAG AS ROOTED. And get this: Exact same problem on my previous phone, and, if memory serves, maybe the phone before that as well. And these are all SAMSUNG phones, used years apart. Infuriating."
"Very good to keep track of your exercise, gives you a motivation to reach your goals."
I docked the app a lot of stars because it has gone brain dead regarding tracking changes in time zone. I docked another star because the developer contact email is a no-reply email address. This shows lousy customer service attitude.
I would love to see more settings around inactivity reminder like vibration intensity and sound options.
Always loved this app on my Samaung phone with Galaxy watch connection. Since last update my exercise/workout data doesn't sync to the app - I have lost 3 days exercise data so far.
"Dont use - Security risk! To work it must have access to all your contacts whether they have agreed or not. If this were optional, it would be acceptable. Required to work. Luckily devices work without it, but less so."
Samsung is once again shown that it's products are complete trash. I cannot get this application to accept my verification code. It's sent to the phone. And that is only the first step of hell that you have to put up with if you own a Samsung product. Never again
"Sleep mode keeps setting an alarm after you manually turn it off everytime, waking you up earlier than you like"
"I give it one star for the simply reason that it's not possible to sync the steps counts (everything else it's possible to sync) with any other app and the smartwatch only works with this app, a waste of money!"
"Disappointed. With my new Samsung galaxy s22. The section where it scans my stress, heart rate is gone! Not happy."
"Great workout tracking app however, I do the same workout everyday and it would be nice if I could copy and paste the workout instead of entering it over and over again."
"I bought my phone in the Philippines because my previous one failed while I was traveling. Back in the US, my watch cannot use the Samsung health ecg monitor app, because my phone is not compatible, it so they say. I spent a lot of money on Samsung products, but the basic ecg monitor is not available üòë. Lame"
Newest update on the app has broken it. Too many issues to list. Developer needs to get a pay cut.
"How is it cholesterol and sugar? we're left out of the dietary equation... would be great if they were added. Thank you for your reply, many don't. It would also be great if you could enable the user to add steps, I don't keep my phone on me most of the time to lower my exposure to radiation."
Evil. Now REQUIRES SAMSUNG ACCOUNT to use which has an impressively DISTURBING PRIVACY POLICY. LATEST UPDATE LOCKED ME OUT of my health application that I rely on daily. I'M NOT WILLING TO GIVE THE DATA THAT A SAMSUNG ACCOUNT EXISTS TO COLLECT! Will be recommending that all my customers attempt to return Samsung phones and watches. After reading release notes this appears to be a DATA THEFT exercise.Updated watch sleep no longer independent of phone. Creepy and wrong..
"Honestly is a good app but I'm extremely disappointed that Samsung Health cannot retrieve steps info from Google Health Connect. Steps is the most basic information and if an app cannot display such info, it might as well not be used. I love the app but if steps info isn't visible then I would much rather use another app sorry. Please do add the steps sync from Health Connect to Google Fit."
Not working after latest update wound up uninstalling and reinstalling loosing the last 2 years of records. Bummer
Since the last one or two updates this app is nolonger accurately recording steps. I can stand still and sling my arm while holding my phone and it records it as steps. If I roll around in bed holding my phone it records dozens of steps. This needs to be fixed.
Please add water reminder and camera app. For other samrt phones also not only Samsung phone. I use oppo. Also when I am in bus steps are calculating. Also can't able to play music in watch mode. Also please add automatically watch mode when battery is 10 or 5%. Also give buletooth option in notification panel. Also give ultra battery saver option. Battery is draining too much fast without use also. When gps navigation is on screen is going off Make it scrn active. Samsung watch 4 44m Bluetooth.
"I used to LOVE this app. Tracked my steps throughout the day, able to enter water/food intake, automatically entered sleep, and I could measure my heart rate/stress level. I have a new Galaxy S22 Ultra, and the heart rate monitor/stress monitor has disappeared from the app. What gives? I guess I'll need to find a new app...."
The application is stuck on the home screen. Same thing is happening with Samsung wear application. I though there must be problem in my phone but then I tried doing the same on galaxy S22 ultra and same issue i faced again. I hope you'll fix this ASAP!
Took away features I used. I have no desire to open the app everytime I want to know my step count. Bring it back to the widget on top like it has been forever
Weekly Summary skips weeks and months at a time. Like using it to keep track of my weekly activity levels. Hasn't been consistent in months.
"Great app to use but while I started cycling workout on my galaxy watch, the step count also increasing .... There is no pause step count option too To avoid this issue... Look into this issue for a better experience."
"Weight recording stopped working properly. For a while everytime I record my weight, it does not show new weight. I it showing the one from yesterday(I record my weight every day). Can we get it fixed, please? Thank you."
Step tracking is broken. Why haven't y'all fixed this? Everybody in here is complaining about this. Your waisting my Z Fold 3 battery because I have to keep the whole screen on constantly just for this to work. FIX THE APP AND DO YOUR JOB. Edit: Didn't help. Update the app! It's not on our side at all.
Works great! It only misses support for external HR monitors. Sleep tracking details are broken on the day of winter/summer time change. It is shown correctly on the watch.
"With the new update my sleep record is not correct. For example, if i try to log on sleep from Friday 18:00 p.m. to Saturday 02:00 a.m., it logs all of it in Saturday! Even though it should count as only 2 hours and than it shows Friday as having slept ZERO hours! Otherwise I love the app, perfect to track my walking , water intake and weight."
Poor I have been using this for long time.lately it has started giving trouble the step counter kind of does not come on the other counters also stop when they feel like.
"This app is not accurate. Or most likely my Samsung watch 5 is not accurate. I did not sleep, but my watch showed I was in deep sleep stage for 1 hour. I use same trail near my home, but every time I have very big differences in steps counting."
The app is very hit & miss recording steps which is very disappointing. This issue started a month ago. Steps do not accurately record even though the phone is in my jeans pocket.
"Just got a Samsung Galaxy Watch 5. For advanced health features (BP, ECG), it wants phone(!) permission & says it's so my contacts can see me in Together. I don't want to be added to your social group. But without this permission, I can't use the app!? How about trying again, Samsung. I shouldn't have to join your social network to use built-in functionality! Maybe do like EVERY OTHER decent app & limit in-app features related to a permission. Or are you using my IMEI number for something else?"
Horrible experience in setting up the account. Extremely lengthy and asks for unnecessary permissions.
"Easy enough for Simple basic info. Haven't really put it to the test, but better than this other app I downloaded."
"Good app, So much helpful information but can't have kilojoules as an option?! Seriously? You can go metric on weight and height so what's the problem? Can't access on phone without setting up lock screen for entire phone. That's up to me isn't it?"
"Have been using it regularly since years, but app is crashing since morning. No update also available. Everytime I try to open, it asks to sign in. When I try to sign in, it says, login already available in Accounts. Unable to access the app."
"It used to be great, I could check my heart rate and stress using a sensor on the back. Also, the step counter is way off from my watch. Disappointing Samsung, very disappointing."
The pedometer feature on this app is completely inaccurate. I take 10 to 30 steps and it counts almost 300 steps. This is misleading and negatively affects my fitness progress. Please fix this!!
Evil app the doesn't work with my samsung watch just because my samsung phone is rooted what a nonsense it worked on my rooted redmi note 9 that will teach me to buy samsong ever again
"i dislike the fact that even though the app lets you sync with fitbit bracelet, it doesnt sync the steps, im missing a lot of steps, because i cant wear the phone while working, and on 13th .11.2022 i walked 33.999 steps. s health has accounted only almost 9000 , while i had the phone on me :( . also a previous day where i had 26 000, i barely have any on the s health, same rrason. i liked the chalneges, and looked forward to be more active on s health, and it was my favoritr app to track data"
"Doesn't work. Endless loop of saying ""unable to set up. Samsung account session expired."" Restarted phone, reinstalled app, cleared cache. Piss poor experience. Using Google fit because their devs are competent"
Definitely the best fitness app I must say that I love new way you could set the time for the amount hours you would have slept but then you guys changed back to older version. I honestly prefer the previous one.
"Hello, i found out that healthy365 app and samsung health app cant sync together because of different steps number... weird!!"
"After the latest update, some of the features and the information they gave no longer work properly"
"Bug if I open :Measure weight directly the default goes to 599kg (fix: close and reOpen) After phone upgrade Also I can't choose my sleep amount from the notification without opening the whole app The EXPLORE section is Great, wow. Keep it up. Only My stairs is on 0Zero I'll see"
It's a great app. One problem is when you unsubscribe to rejoin is like an exam to join the army.
"I'm doing the together challenge with friends, and both mine and my friends' total step count went down. How did we lose steps? Mine went from 50,000+ down to 30,000. And my friends 49000 down to 26000"
I can't edit my sleep record. There's an edit button but I can't edit anything even though the sleep record is clearly mistaken. There is only a usable delete button. It's not helpful.
"Have non Samsung watch/phone - Can't sync steps from Google fit (can sync all other data), which locks me out of Samsung's eco system. Just let me sync my steps from health connect or health sync."
"won't count treadmill steps on my watch 5 :(. This started to happen after the last app update, please fix"
Now for some reason there is no more ability to measure stress and heart and oxygen.. which then makes this app worthless.
"For some unknown reason, Samsung Health keeps logging me out all the time. The app isn't wanting to sync with my Samsung Watch 4 either. It is really annoying!! It used to be a 5 ‚≠ê app but it has gone down hill...."
This new look is not like the other one...I walked this morning...stopped for bathroom break and it never recorded my steps home..it doesn't show my distance and the time I walked liked before...not happy..
Best app in my opinion to track down your health and overall motivate you to want a better health regimen.
"Download the latest version but cannot sign in. Tap on the sign in icon and just get 4 dots going round and round in circles! Been using it for a couple of years, upgrade phone and can't use it with my Google pixel 7 pro and Samsung fit 2."
"Come on people, get the sleep info so we can actually look at it. Being able to see the exact times that I woke up or when I was in deep sleep is essential to helping me sleep better. I STILL sleep with a Fitbit just for the sleep info."
"Otherwise okay app, but missing the possibility to edit recorded workouts, such as time, type, km, etc. It should be a basic feature."
Love Samsung Health linked with my Galaxy Watch. I keep track of my health and set targets which helps me stay motivated.
Whack. Recently it's stopped getting my workouts correctly. Only gives me 7 mins credit for workouts that last longer. Don't know what's going on but please fix the bug.
Good app. Good fitness programs . But i observed walking is noted twice when carring phone with gear watch
This app deserves no stars really. .I used to love this app and the monthly challenges but after looking at how people win the whole challenge on their very first day and asking why this is happening and only got back saying we make sure no one is cheating it still happen. .I stopped doing the monthly challenge cause of that and whoever made this app needs to make it better and to whoever is reading this you guys don't do their job right
What happened to measuring heart rate and O2 from the phone? My Samsung note has the sensors so why isn't the option there anymore? I'm not buying your watch.
"Lost all data, just by simply changing phones and the app reinstalling my watch erasing all data."
I upgraded my phone and now it's not working. My steps are not being recorded. Very disappointing Now my phone isn't keeping up with my watch. 4379 on my watch 2711 on my phone. Both of them have been updated. What's going on
"The app asking so much confidential information and confirmations, even before you could glimpse on what does it offer. I am not even sure if It is what I am looking for. Seems to me like data collection against your will, as it would not let you move forward if you not allowed something, like why the health app should manage my phone calls and my contacts? I guess, I have to be greatful that they did not ask my DNA sample or my firstborn son."
"Love the app, with my galaxy watch 4, I track many fitness signs. I hate the fact Samsung is doing nothing toward cheaters who makes fake steps, 250k steps a day is impossible and need banning..."
Has not been recording any of my steps or info since the new update! Everything is just empty and says 0. Fix this.
Won't install without allowing you access to your contacts... garbage feature for a garbage app.
Earlier it worked well. But now it's showing inaccurate calories count. I request you to set it in next update. Moreover the voiceover of the lady is very bad.
Deletes menstrual cycle data every couple of months! Absolutely useless app. What's the point in having a feature to track periods if you just delete the data with every update?
"Earlier i was able to see my steps count on notification area(top of the phone screen), But now in order to check my steps i have to open the app, Please solve this issue"
"This app worked, but when I checked my steps, it had erased all my steps history it shows nothing now like I have taken a step until today with this app."
The food and exercise tracking works well but I don't agree with the step counting. Two other apps on my phone shows double if not more steps per day than that on the Samsung health app.
Requires permissions to your phone number and contacts for no reason. App won't work without it which makes no sense for a health app. So 1 star for an app that doesn't work.
Been great but not now. Got a Nokia that it says is compatable but it won't let me get past the sign in page. It just sets there and spins. Can't find any help on what to do. If I can get this working the review will definitely go back to where it was.
"After a recent update my Garmin Ant+ heart rate sensor will no longer work. I've spent over an hour with online support, and another hour and a half on the phone. Total waste of time. They must think we are all stupid. After a month Samsung have finally replied saying they no longer anything except Samsung hardware, so my expensive Garmin heart rate sensor is now useless. Thanks, Samsung. And I was going to buy a Samsung watch...that would have been a mistake! Painfully slow customer service."
I got this app basically for tracking my steps and workouts. Everytime I start a circuit training it shows me that I burned 162 calories in 30 minutes! Regardless of the intensity of the workout. What's the purpose of wearing the watch if it's going to feed me some preset formula?
Sleep tracking....why can't we see the timestamps for SpO2 data. Why can't we save snoring clips to local drive?
"Used to work, measured my SP02 perfectly, now it won't even take a reading, constantly says to make sure my finger is over the sensor! Strange that it manages to measure up to 95% before it says to make sure the sensor is covered!"
"Another bug... incredible how you are not able to test correctly. Anyways, now when I record a new weight, it changes to portrait mode."
"Used to love it, but the time in the app has been off by 5 hours for months and Samsung support cannot fix it"
"I took 2 BMI calculations within 5 minutes, the second was after pooping. Somehow dropping a .5 pound turd caused my muscle mass to drop by 2 pounds... I have no confidence in this measurement or that it correctly compensates for stomach contents.. Another stupid feel good measurement touted as accurate? Laughable... (ps, you can consider this my contacting you, so do your best with what I have provided here. I will not provide more) Ps, go shove your phone number for not listening...."
"Got the galaxy watch, however can't get this app to work, it keeps saying failed to setup, I've un- installed and reinstalled it, cleared cache, no change And it's weird that email for contact is a no reply email....."
Love it with the watch 5 pro. My only omplaint is the last update changed auto workout to pause which is annoying when I have a weight lifting day. It's constantly buzzing my wrist. Otherwise love the watch and workout/ sleep tracking
Best fitness recording app All functions are easy to use and the great part is there is almost no adds Best app üëåüèª
"The app is very good, but should allow for logging food for the following day/days so we can plan our meals forward."
"Once again will not work. Constantly says This service is not available. Send message to developer, no response. Tired of same old solution suggestions..clear cache..uninstall..reinstall. Nothing works. No other suggestions as to why it doesn't work and no response to emails."
"What's wrong with the audio guide now? Instead of 1.5km it only says 1km (ie misses every 1/2km); says ""second"" instead of ""seconds"" and some weird pronunciation of ""minute"" when saying the heart rate."
"Got a new phone and the app has refused to open. It's been over a week now, it keeps loading."
"Used to love this app, especially when tied with my watch. But now it will never open. Always just says ""cant set up app right now"""
Latest update will not let be edit sleep time. It says I can't add sleep but when I change from 2100 to 2300 I am decreasing sleep time by 2 hours but app says I am increasing time. Please fix. Latest updates do not fix issue as of 10/21/22. As of 10/27/22 Still cannot edit sleep numbers. It just keeps telling me I can not increase sleep time even though I'm trying to decrease it. Please fix. Updated phone to android 13 and sleep app still will not let me reduce sleep time please fix.
"Very good app, samsung should consider adding ""year recap"" type feature. Also, like the steps count, cycling menu should by simplified a bit more."
Why suddenly the apps stop counting the daily steps? Its still zero while Im walking and running for at least 8km..
Totally worst app I ever use. Can't suppose third party app and worst customer service. They are not really response
"Since the last update, my sleep record is showing during the day when I am active. When I delete the record and manually enter it, it shows the same time I was sleeping."
Won't let you bypass the optional settings and requires you to provide access to your phone number or else you can't use the app.
"The app does not automatically track cycling anymore on the Galaxy Watch 4 and 5. It is very frustrating throughout the community, and is not difficult to make an option. Please fix this."
Just like everyone else steps are not showing on lock screen I turned steps on and off and it just shows samsung health app started please fix
The app work sadly though newer device lost some on device ability but for thale actual app it works just fine! Great app
"I like the app. It does what it needs to do. If they'd incorporate a scanner, I'd give it 5 stars. It's tedious to type your food even though once you do, it remembers it. It would just be a lot easier."
"Can add custom foods, but no way to create custom meals so have to add all meal breakdown ingredients and portions for breakfast lunch and dinner. Major flaw of a meal tracking app."
"SH doesn't work well with Health Conndec, e.g. doesn't synchronize sleep from oura ring. Better use Google fit for aggregation view."
"I was happy with this app until I purchased a new phone Galaxy s21 and now the distance tracker no longer functions properly inside the Y where I walk, I literally have to walk 2.5 miles for the app to register 1 mile. Before new phone 4.5 üåü after new phone 3 üåü and that's because the rest of the app works sufficiently or it would be a 1 üåü for distance tracking alone. I clear the cache and shutdown and restart my phone and watch everytime and it doesn't record inside walking."
"Unable to use, it says I need to grant some sort of permission in settings. Could not figure it out."
"Love the app only one concern, after I set a step goal within the step counter after the day resets to the next day it changes my goal on the previous day to something different why is that and is there a way to stop it?"
"The new achiever level badge is pretty raw bad, why would someone choose such bad logo and user experience is going for downside!"
"Good app, and syncs to Google Fit, except the steps, no idea why that doesn't work."
"I don't use ""Together,"" so why does Samsung Health need access to my phone? Every time this gets updated, it gets worse. I will be looking for a different app and possibly a different phone manufacturer. Not Apple, either."
"Wish I could sync my progress to WW, other than that it's user friendly and used daily."
"Disappointed, I have just bought a Galaxy Watch4 as I was looking for a watch with a ECG sensor and facility. It does have an ECG sensor but you can only use it if you have a Samsung phone, even though the watch is supposed to be compatible with other Android phones. I don't have a Samsung but I have an Android phone. It should have stated that the ECG is only Samsung compatible!"
"I love how it automatically updates from my Galaxy active watch, fast. It looks lovely, it's easy to use but there are a couple of issues. It doesn't let you edit your sleep. I often lie in bed after waking up and it gets tracked as sleep. The other thing that isn't great is the trends graphs. Not being able to show lots of data eg months, on one screen and having to scroll is and hard to see the trend. Also, averaging a week or a month's worth of data into one bar isn't what I'm after."
"There are a number of uxui issues that make the app more confusing or inconvenient to use than it needs to be (for example messages that disappear too quickly and you can't get them back, or having to flip back and forth and then scroll to see the data when trying to compare between days) but the overall concept is great. The calorie counter food catalogue could be more robust and it would be nice to know all nutrients, not just certain ones. The global challenge is fantastic, really helps to motivate you to reach the goal as well as interact with the app and the notifications are spot on, not too much and not too little."
"I like the looks of the new app, it's more clean and modern. I don't like that all the items on home page are full bars, it just wastes space. Like someone else wrote, caffeine and water intake could take half the bar, and steps certainly don't have to take up almost half of the screen. I preferred the old way of grouping activities. I would like to be able to put most used activities on home screen, and have them grouped that way and be able to see last one of each of those activities right there on home screen, just like before, instead of having just one bar that directs you to all activities, where you can see past 30 mixed activities and where you have to find specific type of activity and then use trends to see older ones.   All in all, i prefer the look and design of the new app, but older one was much more functional. So, 5 stars for the old one, and 3.5 for the new one.   Please do some additional work on the functionality!"
"Good app but some issues with its stress measurements. I rarely get it to work, whenever I try it always spends ages where I can see it's picking up my heart rate, but it doesn't start, and then tells me to put my finger on the scanner properly. My finger is always securely on the scanner and I get the notification to go away, I don't move my finger, and it happens again. I never have any issues with the heart rate monitor, but for some reason the stress one just will not work."
"Used to adore this app...now missing features. The weight management feature used to be my favourite part, showing a scale and how much I needed to eat or exercise in order to stay in caloric deficit. I lost weight safely and effectively while using that feature. Low and behold I miss it a lot and still keep hoping it will make an appearance again. Please bring it back! Each update has made the app worse and I miss what it used to be able to do for my health."
"As many others have said, this most recent update (v6) is a step in the wrong direction and quite literally a waste of space. The design of each module has gone worse such that they take up more space but show generally the same or less information. If it isn't broke, don't 'fix' it. I find it hard to believe that this update was tested by anyone that actually uses the app prior to release. The fact that one can't even choose which version is active is really bad. Samsung, please restore the old version. Recognise your mistake and learn from it."
Was Great... Now they are completely wreaking it with updates that keep changing the interface so you have to waste a lot of time figuring out where they've now decided to hide the information you could previously find easily. Keep It Simple Stupid. Leave the interface alone. The idea is convenience! No one wants to waste time learning a new interface. And still has ads.
Was a good app but the latest update removed many useful features. I probably will move to a better place. The biggest issue for me is losing the ability to view weight by week and month. This perspective was very helpful for seeing the big picture with weight loss. Disappointing to see such major changes with no opt out or even warning. Edit: I have moved to Google Fit.
"I loved the app, but the ""new and improved"" Stress test is really driving me insane. I want to test myself for the full duration, not just for the last 5%. I get asystoles every now and then that I'm trying to monitor when possible, but in just 5 % it is a real challenge. Also, the ability to export a visual of the heart rate would be quite amazing. Or at least some sort of a screenshot button, as the normal ways to take a screenshot severely mess up the test result. Or a landscape function for the heart rate."
"I have been using the app for over 5 years and it seems that the app gets worse and worse - for example I am still missing a coffee tracker. I am very disappointed and frustrated with the recent update and would like to go back to a previous version. In my opinion the user interface is bad, graphics are worse, the layout worse, more clutter and less useful info. The functionality allowing to see all weight recording and a graph by a day. I am based in the UK."
"Love the app, the trends so you can easily see your progress, the programs you can enlist in, and how everything is conveniently placed at the home menu (steps, last exercises, heart rate, enlisted programs, etc). However, the speed calculation desperately needs a fix. After a run, all the splits add up nicely to the total duration, however the speed tracker is consistently lower than actual speed. According to the app, on my last run, I ran 3 consecutive kms under 6 min, without ever reaching 10 km/h. As a result, while in a run, the app keeps telling me to run faster, even though I'm going above the target speed. I cannot understand how the developers managed to fail such a basic calculation so badly. If fixed, I will update this review to 5 stars."
"The App itself is pretty nice. Although I get lots of battery consumption warnings on my phone, but I can handle that. The worst is the synchronization with my Gear S3. Every other day it doesent work any more and I need to re-install the app! Horrible! And when the sync finally works, I often don't have the GPS data in the app (only on the watch where I can not access it). And it does not get better when resetting the watch or the app."
"I have been using this app daily for over 2 years now, as I struggle with anorexia and it helps me to try to meet my caloric intake goals every day. The newest update has removed this feature, making the app virtually useless to me, and losing all of my graphs to show my trends and data. I rely on those graphs to show my doctors, and now I have to go into my upcoming appointments blind. I see that the weekly data view is still available, but it doesn't lay out the information in a useful way."
"I really dislike the new setup. What is the use of displaying the same information spread out over more space, making the the usage of the app less efficient. As of this version I cannot control some functions using Bixby (a lot of people hate is, but I think it's really efficient for some phone functions). The new looks are OK, but the functionality had to suffer for it..."
"I've been using this app since 2016. Taking away the weight management feature was a mistake, in my opinion. Thanks to that number i used to be able to understand my weight fluctuations in a second and I could adjust and plan the upcoming week, knowing exactly what I needed to improve. That feature was KEY to my fitness journey. Without it, the app is just another calorie counter + pedometer. I think everyone would appreciate to have it back (and improved)"
"The app was fine untill the latest update removed the Weight Management. The Weight Management does exactly that, it helps you to monitor your weight. Now one cannot measure your progress without using pen and paper and flipping around in the app to try and get all the information together. Very frustrating. Would have given the app a rating of at least 4.5 if that main feature did not disappear."
"With each new update this app is becoming more of a decoration than a tool. It's been loosing even simple functionality such as customisation of weight tracking overviews. (All you have access to now is a single line of data points that you can scroll endlessly‚Ä¶) This is the last straw. I didn't want to uninstall because of the impossibility to export weight data anywhere (!), but even with the loss of a couple of years of information, that is too much for me."
"it's a very good app, but a recent update has left me a bit confused. I've put my weight and height in and according to BMI charts I'm at a healthy weight, a bit near slightly overweight. but it still shows up in the orange. it didn't even do that when I weighed more than I currently do. if I press the i icon then it shows up green. this is at the record weight feature, just a bit confused as it's sending me mixed messages. Otherwise a great app."
"The update prior to this got rid of the ability to view weight by day, week or month. It was really useful to be able to track my averages over months. I saw a lot of people saying the same thing after the last update, so I really hoped Samsung would listen and reinstall this feature. Alas, no such luck. It's so disappointing to have an app that works well losing more and more features with every update."
"I like the overall look of it and basic functionality but am really disappointed that it doesn't track my stress levels. Lots of people have found this missing and there has been no word if that is something we don't get in certain countries or what. (I am in Canada). Perhaps it just my Active 2 watch. However, I expected all the features that I read about in the reviews if the Active 2 and stress was one of them and it seems like other features are missing. If you are going to leave certain features out for specific reasons in certain countries, please be explicit so we don't look for those features when we buy. I will probably return my Active 2 and not use S-health. Also, you don't send heart rate information to Endomono. Start supporting other services for those that more comprehensive analysis of our health."
"I wish the weight management would deduct the calories burnt during rest, instead of gradually throughout the day. It's difficult to plan what to eat, unless you do calculations every time. Also, I've seen some food apps allow one to take photos of packaging. Maybe this would be good to automatically fill in the nutrients for custom food items, or barcodes could be scanned to find the item immediately? If you can't be bothered to get up, it thinks you are sleeping, even though I have moved."
"Terrible prefer the old version. Wished did not update the app , lost a lot of data. And weight management disappeared with all my data. Terrible. I want the old version back. More user friendly . Could see how much nutrients have taken it need to take with one glance. Stupid idea to change it. Change for the sake of change does not mean improvement or better."
"I really enjoy this app and it really helps tracking my workouts and I also feel like it's more accurate on the galaxy watche as well, but there is something I want you to add to the next update. I want it to be able for me to create a playlist of workouts because I found it annoying that I had to change the workout physically instead of it automatically changing itself."
"Love the app in general it gives good stats and does what you need it to do. I am however, disappointed that the widget used to track weight loss goals has disappeared.. It was one of my favourite app features. I could easily set a weight goal, with weekly loss targets and know exactly how much food and exercise was required to meet that goal. Please bring it back!"
"It's a decent enough app, generally good for tracking weight and calories, but seems to lack certain things such as an ability to scan food bar codes so it can be hard finding the right food to record. The step counter, while useful, is not a reliable source and really just a guideline. I haven't used many of the other functions, but from past experience they're ok but not marvellous - for instance you were unable record certain activities such as cycling if you were using a static bike."
"The best health app that I've tried so far! A lot more things to track than in Google Fit for example. The user interface is also better. The global challenges are a nice way to track your step count for the month and keep it interesting. EDIT 2021-05: Dropped the rating from 4 to 3 stars. Too much unnecessary 'fiddling' with the user interface and graphics. Also hate the fact that mobile apps keep having some of the previous functionality removed for no obvious reason. Still works OK, though."
"This app has been working great for the 2 years I have been used it. The past 3 months I can't give it permission to sync with my Discovery App. I have uninstalled and reinstalled both apps and it is still not working. I have switched onn all the permissions in my phone's settings. I even restarted my phone! The button is there to press, but nothing happens when I do. And this is on both apps. Please help?"
"Love this app, used it for about 4 years if I remember right. seems reasonably accurate, good route tracking/mapping when I tell it I'm doing a walk/hike etc. I've never really used any of the social aspects so can't comment on that side, mainly used for personal info. As with virtually everything in existence in the world I'm sure there could be some tweaks that would improve things (:"
"I've been using this app since the beginning of October to track my step count and my weight. I've been finding it pretty easy to use although hard to find things sometimes. I like being able to see my average steps compared to other users, although it would be good to be able to change the time span to a month or more, as well as the last 7 days. I would also like to enter my weight in stones and lbs, rather than just lbs, and to be able to swipe back through my previous weight records rather than just seeing them on a graph. Great app overall though, I switched to using it from Google Fit."
The latest update has removed weight management from the app. It's the only thing that kept me going. Plus the color scheme is horrible. I preferred the older one more. I have astigmatism and sometimes it's hard for me to distinguish between different colors and contrasts. The color scheme in food log is extremely uncomfortable for me as im unable to focus and the colors diverge into one shade especially in the nutrient intake summary bar.
"I really like the Samsung health app, it's probably one of the best fitness apps I've used, especially in conjunction with the Galaxy Watch! What I would love to see added though is a way to overlay all of the data collected into one graph, so that you can see where spikes overlap between heart/steps/stress/sleep etc...for a better idea of what's happening and when. Also, being able to create a set of workouts to string together instead of picking each one manually would be great! Keep it up!"
"Far less functional than ever. The new update has removed the only thing I really used, the ""trends"" charts by week and by month with the high and low ranges and then the list of data below that. The charts were never very good because you could only see a couple of months at a time but they were better than nothing. Now there is nothing. If you could see ranges by month over a year of data would be best and is the obvious improvement that has been staring the developers in the face for many years but never implemented. Now they have done the opposite."
"Basically this is a very nice app with many good features. BUT: Workout data cannot be edited! One mistake, and the statistics are moot. This makes the app all but unusable for any serious purpose. It has been an issue for years. Samsung does not seem to care. EDIT: Thanks for the random copy/pasted response, Samsung. It shows once more that you just don't care at all."
"Generally decent but very much let down by the awful slider thing when entering your weight. It's the worst UI I have ever had the misfortune to encounter on a phone. You slide it to the figure you want, let go of it and it ""bounces"" back to a different value! Please fix. And now apparently requiring an international phone call to read to them what I've already written!"
"I really like the app. It's great for keeping track of my steps, workouts, active time and tracking calories. But if I can make one suggestion, can you stop changing how the menus work? Recording what I ate used to be as simple as looking something up, picking my favorites or picking stuff i've added/custom meals, but now it's all lumped together. And the UI seems to change every couple months. Please just pick something and stick with it."
"Useful app for maintaining weight and getting an idea of the calories, keeping track of your steps, workouts and even menstrual cycle. It has a lot to offer. My biggest issue is recording food, if I make something from scratch it only gives me branded items and sometimes I can't find everything and it's very americanised in its wording. So, if I could track my food better it would be an improvement."
Update. After going through the app again i have noticed the option to view past weight history on a graph is back again. This has brought me back to using this app. If i may add one should be able to add notes to the weight for example waist size. Disappointed that they have changed the way the weight is recorded. The option to view past weight history is very poor. The graph on the previous versions could be selected to give a better overall picture from ones weight gain or loss.
"Overall, the app is fine. But you can not edit/override the sleep time. If I'm watching TV throughout the evening, the watch detects me as sleeping through until morning. I try to edit the actual sleep time , but it doesn't allow me to save. I click the back button on my phone and get options to cancel, discard or save. Save doesn't work so I have to cancel or discard the changes. Hope this issue can be resolved."
"The update to version 6 is a massive backwards step in usability: you used to be able to arrange items in tiles and in the order that was important to you, but now you just get everything in one giant list and while you can re-arrange them by long pressing, you still have a long list. Also, the summary at the top of the screen has disappeared to be replaced by only a step counter. Bad, bad move by Samsung and I have to ask myself how they thought this was an improvement"
"Please get the old version back! Or at least the features which are gone, such as daily totals of carbohydrates and fats. Also morning, afternoon and evening snacks! Its so frustrating when you can't see info for different snacks throughout the day, now it's all together. Really disappointed, never seen an update when everything is worse than before, but in this case it is :("
"Very temperamental... frustrating at times. I so want this to work. The area where you enter your own data is fine - eg how many glasses of water, sleep, food etc. But the pulse, oxygenation reader makes me give this app 2* as it takes ages to make a reading. I mean, trying for 30+mins - does that sound OK to you? And then it still doesn't do a reading. I don't know how many times I've read 'check that your figure is on the sensor'..... it definitely doesn't do well if your extremities are cold."
I used to love this app with all the little widgets. But now they at gone I'm starting to hate it. I've never been into fitness but trying to lose weight so getting into it more. Trying to track how many miles/ kilometres I've done and this just isn't doing it. I've had to add another app to keep track of them. I was really excited to get the new watch for myself this Christmas but now having second thoughts. Started to look at fitbit as it tracks everything very clearly.
"I used to really love this app. I've used it for years and would have given it 4/5. But I absolutely hate the most recent update. It's hard to read trends properly. The graphics are much worse. It's stopped benign intuitive to use. You can't see weight trends over weeks and months, just daily. Awful redesign. I'm in the UK. I won't be phoning internationally for ""help with my issue"". It's a bad design with bad functionality, not an ""issue""."
"This could be a great app, but held back by a number of things 1. Can't alter activities. For example after a hike forgot to stop watch, now think the 10 mile drive is part of the hike! Would be good to be able to go back and edit start and end points 2. When starting a workout from watch it would be nice to be able to take pictures on phone and have them added to the route. Not one photo at a time after workout is complete. Little things but app feels half finished."
"Why is there a huge banner at the top of the app selling products when they say that the ""app has no ads""... of course it does! And you can't get rid of them. When we pay for a premium phone and buy a Samsung watch we shouldnt have to see ads for cheaper products.. Or have ads in the first place. The functionality of the app has deteriorated and basically its just a tracking app and not a good one. The weight management is awful and you can't look at your progress over all in the chart."
"Several updates later and still no improvement. REMOVED WEIGHT MANAGEMENT from the dashboard! The most useful features of the app. The new UI looks like it was designed by an 8 year old. Different tones of the same colour for the nutrient intake that will look cool! While we're at it use as much green as possible. Who cares about using colour intentionally. This app is one of the reasons I stay with Samsung, that reason is rapidly diminishing."
The new version FORCES me to grant the app permission to access my calls and phone book. I do not need the additional feature of 'friend's challenge' or 'together' but am not given the option to choose. This is intrusive and really bad customer experience for me as i own a samsung watch. Definitely won't make the same mistake. There's many more brands out there.
"I use this app every day and I think it's a decent step and calorie counter. But the latest update is a step backwards in my opinion. It has removed or buried a lot of the data that previously I used to track progress (e.g. nutrient consumption, floors climbed - displayed on the main screen - some of the trending info etc.) I can't for the life of me understand why they have removed this info. It's like when they removed the total calories burned data from the SGalaxy watch. Doesn't make sense."
"General all round good app. Easy to use and navigate around. Great being able to chose multiple snack times and save meals. Although I like the monthly challenges, I do think they are rigged. Within 24 hours someone has already done 100,000 steps. I dont belive that. Workouts are generally good, just when you sign up to something, it has to go in the calendar ( which I don't really like.) Update 31/01/22. The app isn't syncing with the Samsung watch. So I've lost workouts and steps."
"Generally like the app but wish I could change the kcal to kjoules. I know I can multiply to get the answer but it's a constant nuisance. Like I said, generally good, the food database is particularly comprehensive with a lot of the local (Australian) brands. I sometimes find I can't edit my sleep times. The Save button doesn't do anything. Not all the time, just the occasional day"
"This app is great, I've been using it for years, however the new ui is horrible! All of the small items such as glasses of water, stress and heart rate, minutes done of each exercise, etc, used to take up one spot in a 3 square row with a convenient button to quickly input data. On my 5.x app I could view at least 12 items. With the new ui of 6.x, every single individual item takes up the width of the screen. I can only view 4 items at most. There's so much wasted space for some items! Half of the stress item is a colourful bar that could be layered over the button. The heart rate is half a giant number! There needs to be work done to compact the ui similar to the old 5.x one, at the very least as an alternative option. In the meanwhile I'll be trying to downgrade my app back to something I can get information from ):"
"It does track the things they say it does, but they keep removing useful features. Just too add them back months later after backlash. Latest example is the removal of weekly/monthly trends. Looking at a daily view of weight is neither helpful or healthy. The old week and month was. Would not be surprised if it gets added back eventually, but would prefer they not break it in the first place..."
"Used to be good. Latest update is terrible. Why did they remove the weekly and monthly charts? And why do Samsung keep giving (what for most would be) and international number for help with the app. We don't want help, we want the old features back EDIT: Thanks for the response Samsung. The problem is though, the new ""features"" seem to be the removal of useful features that others and myself used all the time. An excellent product has become an also ran."
"SHealth is an app which requires terrific patience to use. Mine is running out... My first gripe is the notifications. I can turn autofill calories on or off. So I get a notification EVERY DAY with my choice of being over or under my calorie target. Unfortunately SHealth will not allow me the set a realistic target. It would be nice to either have tgis feature actually be useful or just to easily turn it off. It's a really annoying bug that has been with SHealth for a while and it makes me hate it a little more every day. Secondly the GUI is terrible. Hard to navigate, lacking in detail, with settings all over the place. Whoever came up with it seemed to just want it to look nice without a care for is usability but the end user. Thirdly the ability to sync data to strava is severely crippled with uploads appearing up to 12 hours late. Why do I use this app? Because I have to due to the galaxy watch (which is about as buggy). Truly it needs a complete redesign to make it bearable."
"In general it's a good app. However it's slightly annoying that I can't select exercise and simply add in 1 hour of Pilates after being at a class. To log the class I have to set the timer running and remember to stop it after an hour!?! Also when I'm at work my phone stays in the office but I'm up and down stairs all day, it would be great if you could select ""stairs"" and type in how many times you've been up and down. PLEASE sort this??"
"not a fan of this update. The new podium with your friends, it showed the bars so you could see at a glance, how far in front or behind you were. Now you can only tell by the step count. The smaller challenges, i was able to see how many times id won or lost against a someone, now I can only see my total wins. I need to sync my contacts before I can see the results of a challenge. This app used to be amazing, but it's worse with each update. And no I won't call you about it."
"I've used this for years, found it very useful with diagnosis when I was having issues with erratic heartbeat. Suddenly it insists on wanting to make phone calls or it won't work. Even if I wanted the features the permissions are supposedly needed for, the price would be too high. I've reluctantly uninstalled it. The standard response given to every other posting on this is irrelevant. Make the features and privileges optional. We ex-users won't grant permission for features we don't want."
"Great app! There is a minor suggestion I would make: On the phone, there's an option that allows you to look at your stress levels plotted on a time-chart (time on the x axis, stress levels on y): it would be great if the dev team could colour match the level to the corresponding colour you advertised on the little graphic (green for low stress, red for high). At the moment, if you look at the chart, it's just orange (even for low)."
I like the idea of samsung health app but I've been having some problems. I dont like that since the new update I cant have all the exercises on my home screen in the app. It's rather frustrating to have to go into the exercise section and try to find the right exercise when I'm working out. if I just do my workout and try to add the information after all I can do is put in the time and distance which really isn't helpful when the majority of the time the calories are wrong.
"I have been using this app for 2 years and I like it, have found it very helpful, but I don't like the latest update. I can no longer look at how my weight is tracking over months, and my favorite feature, the nutrition score, which I used to balance my diet and aim to get a badge every day, has disappeared. I can't believe that you removed some of the best features you had! When I replace my watch I am seriously considering changing brands."
"I'm happy to see this improves, since the new update the galaxy watch step count is a bit iffy, sometimes it counts, sometimes it doesn't, but then loading Samsung health on my phone and syncing it seems to get it going again. It's great that you can allow other 3rd party apps to merge data with Samsung. Why not just add a food barcode scanner? Currently I use the free my fitness Pal to scan foods barcodes, then import the food data into Samsung health. Which is okay, but bit of pain having 2 apps, and the calories/ weight management don't quite match up in terms of goals. But overall, both free and certainly going in the right direction. And don't be put off by reviews of the watch, borrow a friend's and try for yourself."
Latest update has removed many features I used on a daily basis. Weight and heart rate trends have been removed to name but a few. The app feels like it's 8 years old compared to the previous version. I'm hoping there is some grand plan to reintroduce an overhauled version of the lost features. From a customer experience perspective this is a massive fail. How Samsung plans to compete with the likes of Apple whilst making decisions like this is completely beyond me.
"The app has been great until recently. I use the app to track my workouts 5 days a week and lately, it has been crashing any time I try to go into recent workouts to see the results. This morning even going into the app and selecting the workout prompted it to crash and any time I try to go into the app it crashes. Not sure what is going wrong. No update to fix bugs available. Impossible to use. Real disappointed."
Used to love it but got new phone with newer version and they have taken away the ability to graph weight weekly and monthly. You can only see daily. What's the point in that. Who loses or gains a significant amount of weight daily that that would be a worth while graph. Graphs are only useful with reference to other data which these no longer have.
"Really like the app and all the features. My one request would be instead of just a ""pause steps"" option we could set a timer for thatc as it's easy to forget to restart it. For example when I drive to work it takes about 30 minutes, and as it's a bumpy drive it adds nearly a 1000 steps each way. If I could set a 30 minute pause I wouldn't have to worry about this at all."
"I like this app, gives a good overview. I'm not fond if the latest update. It was so easy to see the weekly average weight, now I have to search and scroll. Couldn't find the monthly average yet. Rather annoyin is that the app counts reading as deep sleep. What I really miss is a reminder function for drinking water for the gear S3. I installed a 3rd party app, which reminds but doesn't sync with this one. An alarm in the gear S3 would be good when the heart rate goes too high when exercising."
"I was absolutely loving this app, the only thing it was missing was the ability to create your own workout regimen and it was so user friendly with the editable workout tiles on the home screen. Just loved it. This new update has simply destroyed it. I'm looking for a replacement unless it is changed back with personalized workouts. Come on Samsung really? Let's get some common sense happening here it's a fitness app for working out"
"Not happy with the latest update, for many of the same reasons listed by other reviewers. Hard to access info, more limited options. But most importantly, the GPS on the running tracker is totally out of whack! The distances and times are wrong, the tracker places me on bizarre routes I've never run! Useless. 2/26/21 Note: followed solutions offered; no resolution with latest update. As I prefer the original design I've gone back to the factory update. Better design, better functioning. So far."
"Instantaneous pace is measured absolutely wrong. Today I ran 14 kilometers for 1 hour 40 minutes. Thus the actual average pace was about 7.1 min/km. But when I look at the graph, it shows the values around 30 min/km, which is absolute nonsense. Also, the pace values being shown during the workout were also nothing close to the truth. Only the total values for the whole workout are correct. And also the values on the laps stats screen seem to be true. Thus, the issue is most probably related to the instantaneous values - on all screens where they are displayed, should it be a screen shown during the workout, or the graph built upon the end of workout."
"I find it very disappointing that Samsung Health can't/doesn't sync with Strava. I've tried everything to do it but no joy. Tried online but everyone says the same, never managed it. Really this is very poor. The app generally is basic in the extreme. It manages a step count on its own. If you want to manually add exercise, you can do but the app guesses the calories you have used, and for the cross trainer, you can't manually add the distance travelled?? Much more work required Samsung."
"Really easy and simple to use. I use it just for tracking my running routes and the basic stats of it. So I like the interface and all graphic content, the way it's tracking my progress is fully explained and easy to follow. One thing I'm not so satisfied is that I can't regain and reopen my last session with all the data that was captured that time(GPS map, photos etc.). Everything else is really user friendly, and the ""together"" section is so great, I really njoy being part of it! Peace"
"This is the worst health tracking app I've ever used. It is useless, I have to link across to other apps to get what I want, using a paid syncing app. After hours of research and trying different settings. You can't even change the week to start on a Monday. The sleep tracking report is terrible and you can't drill down into well, anything. You can't add steps manually. It won't connect to Aria scales so have to use the syncing app to transfer weight info."
"IT's a good app overall but it is really unfortunate that most training plans that are not created by samsung are just like trial versions and you have to download other apps to get the full ones. It is also great that you can just select food from a list, but it is just as unfortunate that I haven't found even one piece of food with the correct calorie count, I mean like fast food or candy."
"Hands down the most complete and easy to use app/service I have ever used. However, it has one mayor constant problem that it is a real let down: the step tracker tends to not properly sync with my samsung wearable (and I've read various blogs to know it is a thing and that I am not the only one facing this problem). Sometimes it may be off for only 20 steps or so, but sometimes it can be a 1,000 or more steps discrepancy. Reinstall app works but resets the watch so not really a solution."
Very disappointed in the latest update. The ability to display weight is now only on a daily basis. As daily weight fluctuates it is of NO practical use. Previous weight could be displayed weekly and monthly. This was MUCH more useful as it showed an overall trend. I DO NOT LIKE this latest version. I note there are many similar comments from users.
"I like the app, thanks. I use for tracking my workouts, sleep and water. The autopause feature for workouts is cool. 1. It is a bit weird that the number of steps is shown on the walking stat screen only, the cadence - on the running screen. I need steps and cadence on both walking and running. Is it possible? 2. What about adding a setting for more frequent calculating GPS-coordinates. I run on a circular track, in that case speed and distance values are not accurate. 3. It is not very convenient to unblock the phone, run the app and press ""+"" each time I drink water. What about adding a notification with ""-"" and ""+"" buttons (or just ""+"") for tracking water through the notification panel?"
I've been using the app for almost a week and one thing is frustrating. Often I wake up in the morning to drink some water. Then I go back to sleep. The application divides my sleep period into two separated periods with low rating. There is no way to combine them. There is Edit function but it allows only to delete one period of sleep. Not good.
"First of all, after the last Tizen update, it stopped tracking heart rate while walking, unless I manually start a workout. No, support cannot help, they keep saying it should be sent for service repair or whatever. This issue is all around different forums, so I doubt it's sensor related. Second, there is still no monthly or yearly summary. I would like to see what I've done as a whole since I started using this app."
"I think the app itself is great. I also love the watch. But, having no access to my data outside the app environment makes long term tracking and analysis useless. I'm really hoping this is addressed. Simple CSV downloads would be a massive improvement. I'll be considering switching to a service that provides this in future which is a shame."
"After the last update, the app just keeps spitting out average pace at random, while the total distance and total time are OK, and it's only a matter of division, so I can't see why this would happen. To make things worse, my Gear won't start any exercise anymore, just as it starts countdown it simply reverts to the previous screen. The app is really great, but it's crazy to leave stupid bugs like this for 3 weeks and do absolutely nothing about them."
"Its a good basic level health tracker. Simple to use, most/all basic features are there. The calorie tracker isn't as comprehensive as others I've used, but it isn't bad. The challenges are fun, I miss the community feature, but it isn't a deal breaker. I like that it can integrate/suggest other apps for workouts, to improve sleep quality etc."
I would really like this app if it had more manual input options because I don't always have my phone with me so it doesnt have the most accurate information. It would be great if it paired with more step counting devices as well. If this changed I as a personal trainer would love to be able to reccomend this app to my clients to help them monitor goals and progress. I love the group step challenges as well but it would be great to see me global challenges.
"There is something that I think could be improved: A direct widget button to our chosen exercise. When I get my bike for a ride within the city, I have to manually go within the app and open exercises->cycling. I would love if I had a direct button on my homescreen. I also like the monthly challenges. They keep me motivated. I think if you could find a way to eliminate cheaters would be great. Today is the first day of the challenge and the top 10 have already passed 150000 steps. Thank you!"
"I'm annoyed by the recent update. Surely the purpose of a health app is to track progress.... Yet the ability to see any data in chart form or as averages over a period have been removed. I was tracking my monthly average weight, resting heart rate and active time... Now I'm desperately searching for an alternative app that will serve up this functionality for me. Trends are more important than a single day. Without them, this app is pretty much useless except as a way to funnel data elsewhere."
"Love this app! It's doing everything almost alone and everything included in 1 app! Steps count, any sport with GPS tracking, calories, water, relax, fitness programs. If I could suggest something then to have a favorite button for fitness programs, videos, and mindfulness as I can't have 2 fitness programs on my home page. I browse through the fitness programs looking for the next one but can't even save it, so need to go search for it again and again. Thanks"
"It's a good app. It would be better if the meals were numbered rather than lunch, breakfast, dinner, morning snack, etc. Also, it would be really awesome if a barcode scanner was added to the app so that we can scan food items instead of searching the database (which is not up to date with a lot of food products). Also, since the new update, when we enter today's weight, it doesn't show up on the graph; however this was tje case prior to thw update."
"After trying different apps, I realized that Samsung Health is the most comprehensive health app for me, especially as I have a Galaxy Watch and a Note. From the insanely detailed sleep tracking, to food monitoring, fitness programs and more it is almost perfect. One feature that I would love to see is a simple workout log. In the programs the app offers there are rest periods. During these periods, I would love to be able to write down what weight I used and how hard I found the set, so I can track my progress. I think this is one of the little things the app doesn't have to become perfect for Samsung users."
"This app used to be great, but it is not anymore. With the app I lost 6kg since it had a fantastic weight management feature that was removed without an apparent reason or notification. It would be great if you brought this back. I can see that a lot of people liked to use this and found it helpful. The activity tracking is still good but a bit weird to navigate these days."
"Overall experience is acceptable but it should be improved to be up to quo with the standards today. Overall presentation of data is not very user friendly. And sometimes not enough data is present. For example, when I'm tracking my football exercise. I'm expected to see my steps, distance and speed too. But these data only available for running and walking. I could only get my heart rate data and calories ect. Hope samsung team could improve on this. Thanks"
Incorrect data. I have set my correct height and weight. My device is always connected to the GPS and internet. The km count shown on the app is incorrect there is a large gap in what is achieved and what is shown. There is a 1km path near my place and the device always mentions the distance to be 1.5 instead of 1. This has always been the case. The estimation is incorrect and off by a large margin
"The latest downgrade may be the final straw for me and this app. I can no longer read the summary without putting my reading glasses on and they have removed the graphs which were great for a quick check on activity levels. So, a huge reduction in functionality as far as I'm concerned and after years of using this app I will have to find a new one."
"So much more you could do! What about scanning food / drink barcodes? Recording medication and illnesses even just as information. But you could have medication reminders, linked to the reminder edge panel? Other apps have a lot more functionality than this. Although I do think this is the most user friendly app and also has the best dashboard. I like the section you have for training, exercise and meditation programs. But I feel you are missing some basics"
With the new update the app doesn't count the steps unless it is actively running in the foreground and the phone is unlocked the entire time. Hard to keep that up while exercising. If I get a phone call and I choose to walk and talk the app stops counting steps during the phone call. Even when I know I have completed 10k+ steps the app just shows 1000 or 1200 which is frustrating. It messes all the stats and challenges are no longer fun since efforts are going wasted. I was very happy with the previous update and this app motivated me a lot but now it is just frustrating. Uninstalling Edit: I have also tried clearing cache as suggested to some other user who had the same issue as me. But that hasn't worked either. Uninstalling and reinstalling doesn't make a difference
"Everything works fine, but I am really frustrated that it does not measure flights climbed. Is there any reason why this functionality is missing? Got the new update. This new version has brought in horrible bugs. It doesn't automatically to Strava. So after each training session I have to manually export the session, and manually import into Strava. PLEASE fix this. It is quite time consuming. Not a great experience! ‚òπ"
"Erratic recording of data. Suddenly stops when I am on my daily fitness walk and doesn't restart. The route maps are now hilarious, just a succession of straight lines and zig zags. This erratic recording is resulting in a totally useless inaccurate information . I haven't changed my phone or its settings. It worked really well once upon a time now every day is a wonderful magical mystery tour!"
"Terrible update!! This has been a fantastic app and was easy to use to track my exercise and weight loss on a daily, weekly and monthly basis, especially during the pandemic. The recent update makes it impossible to easily track weekly and monthly activity. I hate the new displays and they are illegible. Why oh why did you change what worked fine??? I will now have to look for an alternative I can use. So much for progress!! Can i undo the update??? Please do not just give me the same reply!"
"I love this app, it's easy to use and really useful. The challenges and little competitons have made me walk more this year than I've ever actually walked. The weight management application is great too, I can easily keep track of how much calories I burn and how much I take without feeling bad about myself. I like the fitness programs too, they're easy to apply and reschedule."
I use a Galaxy fit e and I've had a fairly good experience so far. However I'm not happy with the fact that my steps don't sync completely. There's always at least a 500 step difference between the app and the watch. It's even worse with the most recent update. Not nice at all especially since the record of trend is only available on the app.
"the graphs completely suck. You can't see any trends holistically or long term because the only options are ""days"" or ""months"", which it still gives a very limited view of the data. I don't get why there isnt a ""years"" option? or just let the user zoom out? for example all weight data displayed on a graph at once, or at least in a list. Its so silly having to scroll forever left and right to see previous data.. This app is awful. at least it hits the mark on a clean interface"
"A wonderful fitness tracking app, provides plenty of data to analyse and has many great features. Something I'd like to see though is more customization of the audio coach, at the moment it gives a long string of targets hit or speed of previous km, however only some of this I care to hear and can be quite annoying when it goes on for too long. Also, seeing the ability to customize whether the audio guide is on/off depending on if you've running or walking or cycling. Many thanks."
"Since the update I can no longer access the 'together' section, which is frustrating and one of the reasons I liked the app.  Even after searches online I can't find a way to change this.  It comes up with an error message 5107 Also the look and use is more cumbersome, but I guess that's life and I'll get used to it, eventually!!"
"Until the recent update I was very happy with this app. Since the update in September the steps counter has gone crazy. I carry the phone (a Blackberry KeyOne) in my pocket as normal: for 30 minute walk the app only recorded 8 minutes, as per the steps they are all over the place. Not good at all. The simplicity and functionality of the older version are no more. A great pity."
"I like this app, its been improved constantly and is quite fast too. 5 stars, easily. One suggestion regarding the color scheme - as i am using android in dark mode, the app also turns dark. That is a problem when looking at the graphs showing Heart rate, Elevation and Pace. As Elevation is displayed in a dark green, its almost not visible with the black background. It would be very nice to change the colors. But again, perfect fitness app!"
"This used to be a great app but now it's incredibly unreliable. It stops counting steps when walking; I know this because I have 2 other apps on my phone, plus an iPhone and they all roughly agree but Samsung Health is way off. It also used to show you how much of your exercise was at a healthy pace but that function was removed during an update several months ago. So if you want accuracy and functionality, look elsewhere."
"Nice app. I like community features a lot. I don't like the lack of out-of-the-box Google Fit synchronization. I also don't like the lack of history for nudges in challenges. Sometimes it's hard to read them all at once. It would be nice to have better direct messaging functionality. Also, I wish I could pin certain community posts, so I can revisit them later. Other than that, nice app, I really like it."
"SpO2 taken away! Why? (for those who need it, you can uninstall the app and the default version from your system install will restore functionality. Then disable the auto-updates in the play store profile). The ads are annoying enough, but now you're removing functionality from the software? This is an important feature that many have come to rely on! The stress option, which isn't available in Canada, seems like an incumberance with dubious utility. Your ux team failed on this hard."
"The pulse and sleep monitors are good. Food tracking is too complex, so I just made 4 presets for 'large', 'medium' & 'small' meals, and a snack. Where the app falls down the most is editing incorrect data - sometimes I can't adjust my sleep time if it's made a mistake. And if I forget to take the watch off when playing guitar, it racks up 4000 steps for every ten minutes. This can't be edited and messes up the active time and weight management for the day. I would also love to track fasting."
"Great for getting fit, but step count not accurate. I loved this app when I first got it. It worked brilliantly on my old phone for trackingwalks and eating habits. The challenges are great. When I downloaded it to my Samsung A20 it wasn't accurate for my step count (underestimated! üò¨) and also the location feature for walks isn't working, only recording parts of the walks. Such a shame as used to be amazing."
"Since 2 March, 2021 the app doesn't sync the sleep data from the watch to my phone anymore. It used to work perfectly before but the update seems to have messed it up. Also, why can't I see the daily calories burnt in a separate widget and in the graph formats provided. The whole point of the watch is to get more information about the daily intake and expenditure of calories so I can make better decisions about my workouts and eating habits. Please fix this samsung."
"Samsung Gear Sport (great smartwatch!) user, for years. S Health is decent, but the app has a clunky user experience, and there is no web dashboard (why not???) Too many notifications. Sync to and from other services is hit and miss, even with 3rd party software. The app needs a proper refresh, and the service needs a web dashboard. I hear Samsung is pulling some features (weight, water, caffeine...) which is fine in my case, but I don't see any new features or UI improvements. A lot of common sports are missing, too, like surfing (I see windsurfing and kitesurfing, but not surfing). If Samsung wants my next watch to also be a Samsung, they need to add features and improve the end-to-end experience.If only the apps were as good as the watch itself..."
"It used to be possible to see the amount of steps I've walked for a specific month or year, along with other details like km's walked, calories burned, etc. but I don't understand why this functionality was removed when it was so helpful? Now you can only see total amount for that info since you've started tracking it by going to Exercise and clicking what I'm guessing is the Trend icon, then scrolling to the bottom... but that is just total amount."
"This app has been amazing, and I would have rated 5 stars if it hadn't been for recent update. I can no longer open the app, and get an error message every time I try to use it. I have uninstalled and reinstalled but now get stuck on the optional permissions (data sharing etc) where I just get the loading icon for hours until I give up... I'm really disappointed as I have used this app to track weight, movement, food, water for months and have lost all my data."
"Samsung Health is my go to fitness app. Easy to use & touches almost every aspect you need to monitor & help you with your fitness goals. I highly recommend it. It would be 5 stars for me, however the challenge that I face is that it is hard to track tropical/exotic meals as there is little data on their nutritional content so I can't use the meal tracking portion effectively. It would be great if that could be figured out, but in the meantime, it gets 4 stars for me."
"The functions and features are good, sleep/exercise/food etc and all generally work well. The sleep tracking appears to work but there's a distinct lack of detail about how much of each type of sleep you should be getting. The integration with other services however is surprisingly straightforward. My main issue is that the app recently updated to now make phone permissions mandatory. No idea why and the description on the store says optional. Plus their fo tact email isn't for contacting them."
"I enjoy using this app along with my watch, it's simple yet I find it does encourage me to move more and is a useful tool in living a generally healthy lifestyle. I also enjoy the monthly global challenges however they are ruined by obvious cheats who dominate the challenges. The top of the leaderboard is basically a competition to see who can cheat the best, it is infuriating! Overall a great app."
"I'm using Samsung health since almost 2 years now and with every update I'm getting more and more disappointed. At the beginning it was super easy and helpful to lose weight. Showed how many calories you're in a deficit, but sadly they deleted this function and many other useful stuff too. The only reason why I'm still using SH is because of the calories tracking, but it's not the same as before. The design also changes everytime and not in a positive way, more in a sad and cold way..."
"I've been using this app a lot for the last 6 months and I was quite happy with it (until the latest update). I like that it automatically detects walking. The burned calories are a bit off, but it's ok. Having to manually input all the food is a bit annoying, but the worst thing is that and the latest update eliminated the weight management function, which was the main driver for using this app. If they don't bring it back, I'll probably switch to another one."
App is ok. I just got the Samsung galaxy active 2 and was very excited to be able to use a smart watch. I switched from a Fitbit Versa. I dont enjoy the Samsung Health app as I question the accuracy of it. I burn the EXACT same amount of calories in a 30 minute period each time. I also do not like the options for workout choices. I either use weight machine or other workout. I'm not interested at all in recording specific movements as it takes away focus from the workout itself.
"Just got my galaxy watch 3. No simple way to check on activity, or sync it to Strava. No I don't want to use the strava watch app (which is terrible) we should simply be allowed to sync samsung health directly without the need for a third-party app (Healthsync). Also agree with everyone, very, very silly idea to remove the weight tracking feature. I've never had the luxury of using it, but it's an obvious function that I expected to find on my near ¬£500 watch... come on Samsung, bring it back!"
"They have recently removed the best features of the app. The weight management feature was a great motivator and definitely the best part of the app. The caffeine intake counter was also really good. They've removed these functions (for apparently no reason, as I can't imagine they are difficult to maintain) and now the app is half as useful as it was. They need to bring these features back, or I'll look to use another health app (and probably ditch my Samsung watch and phone at next upgrade)."
"I used to be so happy with this app. It helped me lose just over 2 st over 18 months. Because of the app I actually also purchased a GearFit watch so I can track my progress and balance my calorie intake properly. A massive help was the weight control feature as it was essential in my meal planning. With the new update, the feature is gone so the app has lost it's usefulness to me. Very disappointed with the new update."
"Overall excellent BUT.... This app has been a game changer for me, providing motivation, showing results and rewarding goals met. The community feature is excellent too! However I need some help, I had to turn off the notifications a few weeks ago as app was pinging over and over for no reason. After I switched back on app has stopped recording any data like steps or detected exercise. If you can fix you get the full 5 stars."
"It's OK. The step counter is accurate. It's very confusing to navigate, and it's missing some basics like the number of minutes you were active/walking. I liked the feature on the previous version that showed your activity level related to others in your age group, it was motivational. I don't know why they removed it."
"Such a shame that you guys don't do anything with the feedback people give you. Just look at the last 100 reviews, almost all are 1 star! I used to like this app a lot, but it is really becoming more and more useless. Focusing on other things then tracking workouts. e.g. The app cannot track where and how far you have run anymore, unless it's open all the time while you are running. There are simple fixes for this, but I guess the focus now is more on collecting as much personal data as possible"
"Still no new sign of progress to bring back the weight management section. I've reduced my rating further. Why would I use the app now? Also the activities have not been added as I requested earlier. One good thing, however, is that there's now a blood oxygen test separate from the stress monitor and the option to record if you're ill or at high altitude. An extremely useful device: a life saver under current circumstances."
"It was good until the update. Now its impossible to view your weight over an amount of time (eg by week, month, year) just where it is now. Why remove such a key thing. To me this app is now redundant, competitors such as fitbit is doing it all way better at this point so I'm just going to shift the last bit of info that I used to keep in the this app (and sync) to that app instead. I just need to figure out how to export a couple of years of data, probably something else which is impossible."
It's a good app. We can keep track of several aspects of exercise and health (special if we use the Samsung watch) . I like the challenges and the fact of keeping in touch with friends during challenges is a good value added. but it's very annoying when you try to post a reply and the app says try later! Sometimes you need to pass hundreds of posts back to reply to your friends post or find a way like a challenge to explain why u didn't answer :(
"I've been using this app for a while and it has been stable and has useful features. The recent update has not delete my local profile but it looks like I still cannot backup or restore to my phone or PC. Yet again I will NOT create an account to do this when it is not necessary. It also looks like the updates revert the items to a ""default"" state rather than continuing to use the ones you have already selected."
"I've been using it for quite a few years now and it was very user friendly. It's now October of 2020 and I haven't been able to get into Samsung Health since I switched phones. I went from a Samsung Galaxy 8+ to an Samsung A70 and the app won't let me in. Keeps saying 'Temporarily unavailable keep trying', for months now. It's become more than slightly annoying and I'm pretty sure I'm going to delete this soon. No point keeping something that doesn't work."
"I've been using this App every day for a couple of years. Would have given 5 stars before update but this has removed at least 2 of the sections I use, aerobic and cycling, plus the 30 day limitation on record keeping. It's introduced programmes that I would usually seek out from a specialist application when required, that I don't feel are relevant to the way that the Samsung was originally designed for. So, sorry but I'm going to look for an alternative. Edit: It seems I jumped to wrong conclusion and reviewed before fully examining the update. I see that my records go back at least a year and exercise have been grouped under single headings. Apologies to developer. I can see that a lot if work has gone into improving the whole package. I'm still not sure about the new layout, but it will probably grow on me."
"Upgrade removed the weight management feature, this was a great feature and really helped me stay on track and being able to see this every day the calories in vs calories out in one place and being able to track trends. I was very disappointed to see it removed! The most recent update seems to have made the app worse not better!"
"I really enjoy how the app has multiple trackers such as water, sleep and calories. I've found the excercize tracker really helpful too, but I feel it would be a great help to implement the ability to create your own work outs or simply add previous ones instead of having to do it again then and there. Would be much appreciated, but otherwise a great app :)"
"I love this app. Although, I liked the old interface design better, it was easier to see at a glance the data you entered for the day. And it seems like I can't add food items anymore... which was one of the most useful features because the bank of food isn't complete at all. Anyways, still a great app to keep you on track."
"What's going on with the Samsung Health app, I have been using it for years with no problems but over the last month it seams to have lost the ability to track my rides properly, just dose a point to point and back, dose not always automatically resume if I stop, calorie count is all over the place, the only thing that is consistent ist the ride time. What I thought was an odd glitch seams to have become the norm. Any one else having these problems."
"Given up trying to use it - the only reason I wanted to was to sync with my watch. Offers to sign in with Google, then says it can't, then makes you reset a password that worked last time, then doesn't load . . . . . Once installed, it burns through battery. All other apps were working fine, with Samsung Health as the exception. Save your time and effort and find an alternative."
"It has been really good app before with premium features. However, the accuracy has changed after the update. For Instance: 1. In 49 mins I did 5.1 km but it says automatic workout has been recorded 7.33km. the time is right but the distance is wrong by over 2 km. 2. When you receive a call during the work out it stops the automatic workout for some reason. please fix these problems which I have noticed so far. thank you"
"Latest update (as of march 2021) ruined the whole thing. Weight tracking is useless and you can not see extended time periods anymore, just day-by-day, so it's effectively super annoying if you want to get a bigger picture. Incredible amounts of space wasting where it could be used for showing you know... information it's tracking? Feels like early 2000s Microsoft: early versions are great and then get consistently ruined. I won't be calling anyone, don't even bother."
"I do find the app useful, it is my preferred health tracking app, the syncing with my Galaxy Watch is good. Samsung's tight integration betwen hardware & apps keeps me in their ecosystem. But I don't get them updating apps and taking features away, it's frustrating! I liked the ability to view a history of weight & heart rate data by week & month but this is gone. Also I would like to be able to specify the portion size if I add my own food so I could set nutritional values per 100g or per kg."
It would be quite good.. but there are some issues that makes it a pain to use. The biggest one for me is the lack of ability to edit/trim the workout's. It's so easy to forget to end the workout - why oh why can't we trim it. It's so easy on my wife's Fitbit. It was suggested by users for at least 2 years.. but apparently Samsung don't see it useful. Syncing issues is whole another story.. just hopeless :D
"*Edited to add.. It updated or something because it suddenly works again! Everything works great again. Thanks so much! It wont measure heartbeat or anything else keeps saying there is an error. Hopefully a fix happens and I would be back for sure. I've tried installing and uninstalling, changing the app settings and permissions, deleting the cache and data, restarting my phone...all to no avail. Before it was awesome and I really hope the bugs get ironed out!"
"Being able to see my step count and access all the other features of the app through the bixby button is nice, I also like the monthly challenges. Though it seems like those few users who are at the top of the leaderboards have found a way to exploit the way that steps are tracked and as a result have ridiculously inflated step counts, far beyond what a human could do. I have found that there are numerous circumstances in which steps are counted when they shouldn't be, such as when I'm using a riding lawnmower, or even riding a bus! As a result, my step count increases by THOUSANDS just by sitting on the bus for a half hour! This is something that needs to be fixed."
"Updated: 4 to 3 stars. They added a period app, but it's very basic. For example, you can't keep track of spotting, if you took a pregnancy test or keep track of if you took your pill. I've had to download a separate app (IUD issues), and found most free period apps provide more detailed/useful services, including the Fitbit period tracker. The tracking seems accurate for steps, heartrate, and sleep (Active Watch). It lacks the ability to click at specific time and see detailed info. Decent."
I would give this app 5 stars if it didn't occasionally cut out in the middle of runs. Today I ran for 30 minutes with 5 min walking on either side for warmup/cool down and it recorded 24 minutes then 19 minutes separately. One time it recorded the second half as walking even though I increase speed every 5 min! I want to be able to use screenshots for progress and that doesn't work if it doesn't get the whole run. :(
"2 1/2 stars UI is difficult to navigate - I always end up rummaging around to find the setting I need. The step counter counts ~15-20% more steps than I make. There's no weight management. Food items are plentiful, and yet, when I 'm adding to my meals, it's difficult to find what I need. Related to that, there's no barcode scanner for food stuffs."
"Very good application but it has a very annoying feature. Every 1 km there is a voice notification saying what distance was completed, how much is left and so on. It can appear when you listen to some important news, participate in a meeting, etc. It is not clear at all if it can be turned off in application installed on Galaxy phone."
"The update from the 5th of August version 6.11.0.061 took away the option for ""Weight control"", which I find very upsetting. Because you could put in target weight, choose difficulty level for how much you want to lose each week, which would show how many weeks it takes to get to the target. I found this a very important feature, and I wish we could get it back. I use this app every day, and it has really helped me towards my goal! Please take this feature back, and I will change my review to 5!"
"It's really good and helps you track progress. I love it. I've lost a lot of weight using this app and I feel healthier with the food guide. I love that its not only about calories but nutrients aswellüòé. Only annoying thing is the step challenge... there are people who take 100000 steps a day, how is that even possible. That really demotivates me from trying. üôÅ"
"The app design is clean, layout is user friendly and synchronization with Samsung Active Watch is quick (I use only variant, where bluetooth is on all the time). I'm giving this app only 4/5, because I couldn't figure out how to personalize notifications (maybe it's not possible at all) - I really don't need update once or twice a day during my period ""to stay active even through it"". It's not bad to receive this message once during the period or better once in couple of months, but it's super annoying to see notification number near the app every morning just because of this unnecessary information. Also after last update of app, where it was redesigned, the section ""For you"" (where is also located the info to stay active) causes a lot of crashes od the app (so I'm stuck with notification number for even longer :D)."
"I love this app!  For the last 3-4 years I've turned in to a fitness junky, in part due to the rise in popularity of wearables, use of apps, and tracking performance.  Originally I used Windows Mobile and the Microsoft Band, but once they discontinued the product, and due to a hardware issue, I had to switch.  I jumped over to a Samsung S8+ and a Samsung Gear S3 smartwatch. I regularly use this app with my Samsung Gear to track runs, exercise, hiking and more.  It's great that I can also connect it other apps, such as MapMyFitness, LFconnect (for treadmills), Strava and more.  It's great for tons of exercises, but I use it mostly for running, biking, hiking, and strength training.  Absolutely love the combo (the hardware and the Samsung Health app). Can't wait to buy one of the newer gear watches to use it with in the future!  Thanks Samsung! :)"
"A few versions ago it was an excellent App, despite the adverts. However, the past few updates have removed core items I used daily and replaced them with visual changes that are unnecessary. If I could roll-back to a old version I would. I have contacted Samsung about this but without much success. Specifically the items missing are: 1) ability to do weekly/monthly averages for weight, 2) floor counter, 3) memory of meals from the past week. More work should be done on usability and not looks."
"New update has taken away features. Weight for example used to show a graph so you could track how your weight over days, weeks or months. Now it just allows you to input it. You can bo longer compare to this time last year or what your average was 2 weeks ago. Used to be a good motivating factor but now not so much. Usually updates improve apps and adds features not take them away. Overall usefulness of this app is now not very good at all. Wont be using and will have to try and find another."
"Overall the app is fine, it's great that I can have everything in one app. The problem is that I'm trying to make sure I'm getting all my nutrients every day, but half of the foods listed don't even have all the nutrients logged. Which makes the nutrient tracking pointless. And I can't figure out how to edit my food list. Also would appreciate a way to enter calories burned manually after a treadmill run."
"It is mostly a helpful app. It's super easy to install and use. Has great features generally.The current design update is pretty ugly however and a bit glitchy. For whatever reason the stress monitor and other body metric records(muscle, water) doesn't work or aren't there. And it takes ages for it record my lastvwork out. But it does a decent job for a free app. I enjoy the monthly group step challenges and the daily health records that track steps, activity and calories burned."
"Focus on one tweak for now, in the food tracking part of the app, the total daily calories can be adjusted, but not the macronutrients (carbs, fats, and protein). As many different medical conditions and individual choices of type of diet influence the ratio of these, they should be adjustable as well. This would improve this part of the app greatly for me."
"Nice, useful app. But design seems to change every week or two (buttons move, features move, useful stuff is removed, useless stuff is added, you need MORE moves to perform the SAME action as before, number of meals go from 6 to 3 then from 3 to 4 then from 4 back to 6 and then they add a step in the middle where you select the meal you want to add... but if there is a meal, you now have to go to the list and then, instead of selecting a meal you want to add/update, you press a ""record meal"" button and then select item from the list... which is an extra step compared to last design). Oh and then they have this useful body weight goals and tracking feature that sets you up with some calorie goals. A few years later they remove it as it is useless (or maybe it was hidden behind 5 sub-menus with no hint whatsoever that such a function existed in the first place, so only those, who dug deep, knew and loved this function). A few years later they re-add similar functionality, except in a limited fashion. Why did you remove it in the first place? Please stop messing with the interface. Thanks."
My main issue with the app is that you can't sync it with any other health care app. With my galaxy active watch I'm king of forced to use samsung health because I can't connect it with any other app. It would be nice the weight management to be returned. It was a nice feature. Also they should add barcodes scan for easier nutrition and calories tracking. Maybe a chart with stat weight and goal weight where you can see your progress would be nice as well.
"What a terrible update. I only ever really use this app to track my weight and the ability to track it over days, weeks and months was a great motivator. The new update has removed the ability to view weeks and months (with highs/lows) which, for me, renders it useless. There are lots of bad reviews for this new update so Samsung, take note and tell your developers to reinstate these features. An ability to view larger graphs in landscape would also be useful. Please don't ask me to call you."
"The addition of the group step challenge was nice but then if it doesn't work properly it defeats the whole purpose of adding it in the first place. I have now lost several challenges where I have reached the step target first. Instead of wrapping up the challenge when I hit the target, I just sit and watch over the next couple of days as the other participants catch up and reach the target. Once they reach, it wraps up the challenge, makes them the winner and me the big loser!"
"Over all a good app. My two gripes are: 1. Recent update changed the way you see you're daily resting heart rate making it much more difficult to see the trend, instead having to view each individual days result one day at a time. 2. The step challenges are good motivation for many, but it's ruined by the top 10 on the leader board clearly being fake step counts. E.g. all above 99k steps by the end of the 1st day of the February challenge."
"The recent update removed the ""weight management ""feature. I am highly disappointed with this removal. That feature has assisted me with being able to see how much I was consuming versus burning. I had a better understanding of what and how much I needed to burn in order to lose weight. With this feature removed I find the only thing good about this app is the food diary. The colouration that was done with this update is awful as well. Will find a new app to use."
I used to think this app was great. Lots of features but the most important to me was heart rate. Unfortunately this feature no longer works properly. I have an e-Fit watch. It measures the heart rate but now it only syncs to the Health app if I set the app to an Exercise mode. I like it to measure continuously which the watch clearly does but the app just doesn't pick it up any more. Would be nice to get the blood pressure feature fully functional too. I also don't like the new sleep graphic!
A fun and easy way to track walking and running along with other activities. The challenges are fun there like little games and if you have friends who will use the app with you you can race them to the end of the challenge. You can see other people's ranks and although I was no where near first place it seems like no one person can get 1st because it looks like some one in the USA is using this app to show just how fit all of America is. And that seems a little unfair. If your going to do that you should put other countries in as well.
"Very smooth and well made, most features are pretty useful however the calorie balance feature that shows whether you're above or below your target for the day is put in a confusing way. Maybe try having it show whether you're at the correct ratio of calories burnt to calories consumed throughout the day instead of showing what your result would be if it was the end of the day? Also make the ""good"" range a bit wider or adjustable, it's currently a very small margin"
"Been using this app since brought the phone. It was easy to use, but the latest update is a bit inconvenient. All the setting been separate to individual, need to scroll up and down to find the things instead of one glace for overall view. Second thing is the meal tracking system is not properly function, some food previously have but can not be traced and need to manually trace back history to add to current record..."
"Loved the original app on S8, but after the update no so much. Firstly, in the original app all the activity cards were beautifully pitorial and presented in easy to see blocks. Now it's just a long list that you have to scroll through. Just visually I enjoy this so much less now, disappointing. Secondly, I run the same route each time, but it estimates 7k one day, and 9k the other. The audio guide often skips info during the run. Would be nice if these were fixed."
"Good until it goes wrong. I've had the app for years and all of a sudden it has said that unauthorised changes have been made to my phone so the app has stopped working. I deleted the app and downloaded again, losing all my saved info. It worked for another few days and now has the same message again. I've contacted Samsung, but they were useless. Unfortunate as I love the app, when it works."
"A bit meh. Not sure if I trust a lot of the data & my watch rarely syncs all my steps. I've done 30,226 today but my phone has only downloaded half. Miffed is not the word... Good for sleep, food & periods though. It used to track all my steps but now for whatever reason, it won't sync my steps when it's not connected to my phone. It just keeps saying it can't complete syncing. I've tried all the settings but to no avail."
"Generally I like the platform, but the fitness and mindfulness sections are very cumbersome to navigate to and around. It's frustrating when you're navigating your way to the same area every day by needing to click, click, scroll way down and click just to get to the mindfulness area before then navigating around within that. It would be great if the most used pieces within the fitness section were bumped up to the top of the list. I'm tempted to just cancel and use the Calm app separately."
"I love the app. However, there have been a lot of bugs recently. Stopped recording Bedtime correctly. Doesn't recognise when you on your phone at night. There's no speed or tracking for cycling. It's not working! It does record running, but has been a bit off. Please, FIX IT ASAP!!!! No, I cannot contact you by phone. I cannot call a US number, I am in UK. Automated response is not great. New bug, not syncing with the watch. Please fix."
"Like many many recent reviewers, I am extremely disappointed with the latest version of the app. I mainly use the app to monitor my weight. Most of the weight functionality has disappeared. It's not practical to scroll backward and forward to check fluctuations in weight on a daily basis. What I need is the old ""Trends"" functionality giving min/ave/max over dayslweeks/months. What we have now is useless. Don't bother asking me to call you. I will nowdelete the app and look for something better."
"I use this app quite a bit, and find it intuitive and user-friendly. My only complaints are 1) that the blood oxygen saturation measurement feature was removed during the last software update, and 2) that there no longer seems to be any way to disable step counting on the phone. I work on a boat, and every time I hit a wave, the phone thinks I'm taking a step, giving me a false high step count at the end of the day. Hopefully, these issues will be resolved in a future software update."
"Last update now fixed bug, sleep graphs showing. However, they have removed the button to show continuous heart rate graph, which I found very useful. Why they keep insisting that everyone wants what they want. Why can't they leave the choices there for people. Same with sleep data, a while ago they took away they option to switch it off, I probably would just swich off, and not have it sending data I don't want recorded to Samsung Health. Come on guys allow everyone to work differently."
"Initially gave the app 5 stars. It was a great addition to my fitness goals. However, for some time now, the step counter on my Sampsung A50 has not been recording my steps accurately at all. Example: I walked 5km this morning and it only recorded about 1200 steps. Would be great if this is resolved as I like to take part in the monthly challenges. Other than that I've not seen any other problems. Good app otherwise."
"Since the update of the app the step counter doesn't track my activity automatically, I have to open the app for it to start counting my steps. It used to detect it automatically and that was helpful. Also the food tracker, it doesn't have the auto-fill, or prediction function anymore. It used to offer you food options as you were typing and that was helpful to find what you needed. Now you need to type a word; search; not find what you needed; try luck with another word... Too much time!"
August 2021 update has taken off the maps from walking and the altitude which is very helpful as I walk up & down a lot on various routes. At first I thought my gear fit2 pro had gone faulty so I bought another one. But not the phone but the app. Each update takes away another useful or for me essential feature. This is my second bad experience with app updates this year and makes this app now next to useless so looking at other manufacturers / apps. Silly Samsung going backwards again. üò° I would love to go back the the far more useful version (for me) that I had a year ago after my cardiac incident.
"Like the new update of different heart rate zones, more informative. However, I have a galaxy watch and app is getting stuck now. When working out if I stop, it goes to the finish? Screen and isn't restarting workout recording when I start moving again. Keeps reading heart rate, buuut distance, time etc don't change. Frustrating, having to finish and start new workout."
"Spent three days trying to get a new phone (non Samsung) logged into my account but only got a spinning progress wheel. After a lot of wasted time I found out you need to hit ""skip"" on the log in page (which this version doesn't have), only the older version has the skip option. So after finding an older version online and installing it I am finally able to log in. If I didn't have the watch that requires this app I would have given up and never used it again."
"Keeps crashing. I have the steps on the notification bar. When I click on it, it loads up and I can look at trends etc. If I look to go back, or open the app from my home screen, the app loads and immediately crashes. I'm on a P20 Pro so don't know if that has anything to do with it I've cleared the cache and uninstalled etc, but the same issue continues. Makes my galaxy watch seem pointless at times."
"This app is useless! It lacks so much functionality and is not anywhere near comparable with Fitbit or Polar. e.g. Need the ability to drill down data in sleep chart. If you wake up in the night, say to go to bathroom, it splits sleep into two separate charts in the sleep chart. You have to manually add up to get your night's data. Please don't tell me to call the developers, just do something about it."
"I've only just switched over to the Samsung Active 2 watch 2 months ago after owning a Garmin for many years. It took me a little while to get used to the Samsung health app, once I got my bearings I loved it. However now to find the weight management feature has been removed, I'm extremely disappointed. I was using it daily. Please bring it back, it was very helpful and useful."
"This app has turned into an absolute shambles. Not only have they removed the weight management features but the icing on the cake.... You can't sync WALKING workouts to myfitnesspal. In other words, the most common form of exercise in the world cannot be logged and synced to the most popular calorie tracking app in the world. Its a complete disgrace."
"I first started using this app when I first bought a samsung smart watch. I had already been using Runkeeper as a fitness app for several years but Runkeeper wasn't able to import data directly from my watch. This app has never really impressed me but at least  I could record my workouts in Samsung Health which could then export that data directly in to Runkeeper. Recently, Samsung made the stupid decision in their latest version to remove the ability to work with other applications. This has forced me to revert to an older version of Samsung Health which still has the ability to work with Runkeeper but using older versions of apps is not ideal. I can't see how removing the ability to work with one of the oldest and most popular workout apps was a good idea, especially when people like me have a decade worth of data in runkeeper and have no wish to replace it. It's effectively crippled what for me was the most useful feature of my smart watch and led me to consider other watch brands. Removing useful features that people still need is a major reason I stopped buying Apple products. It's not something I expect from Samsung."
"I love everything about this app for the purposes for which I use it. I love the features of: the recording sleep, the amount of glass of water üíß record, the steps and activity recording. Now and then I tinker with the other features as well. This app is a feature that makes sense. It helps me to improve my health with a certain level of convenience. And the interface is visually appealing."
"The monthly global challenge or step challenge is sometimes irritating in regards to the star accumulation. I have finished for example 100,000 steps which is equivalent to 3 stars. If for example I have been busy and unable to open the app for a little while, it will say that I have missed the first two stars and only the 3rd star will be received. Everything is ok otherwise, but in regards to the accomplishment of stars, it is sometimes disappointing when it is telling you missed a star even though you passed it already"
"It's alright but the rewards/achievements needs a lot of work. They need to add milestones and better track physical activity. I find the layout not intuitive. The apps can do the basics but that's it. If I had to grade it, I'd give it a D-. I'll likely change devices and app in the near future. Not samsung. You don't pay enough attention to your users and it shows."
I really love this app. I've been using it for years and it's my favourite all in one health app and I have to commend the developers for that. However I'm giving it a 3 star rating in hopes one of my complaints is heard. EVERY SINGLE time I use the new fitness program features. The workout stops midway or bugs out or my Galaxy watch active disconnects and I'd love for that to be patched as I have a rewards program on my medical aid and the inconsistent data tracking doesn't help.
When the last release removed the weight management feature I had high hopes it would be re-added in the latest update based on the negative feedback of its removal. I just downloaded the recent update and the weight management function still isn't there. That feature is the main reason I use the Samsung watch. I think I will look into other products now that this one no longer serves my needs.
"Stopped tracking my steps ""accurately"" since the update. Sup with that. Gonna make me cancel my order of the Samsung gear 3 frontier due to this issue Got the Samsung galaxy watch. Everything syncs just fine to the phone but what's up with the ""floor count"" it just skyrockets even though I haven't gone up an incline I also hope a feature is added where I can ""favourite"" a workout so I can find it whenever I want to try it instead of having to scroll through a whole host of workouts."
"This is now the second time in 3 days that the app just stopped counting my steps randomly. The only way around it is to restart the phone. I was hoping I just needed to update but apparently this is the latest version. There is no bug to report as the app works, it just doesn't count the steps. And I checked, they are not paused. EDIT - I am not calling you in the US for this. Are emails not sufficient enough to deal with the issue?"
"When I first got the phone, the app was great and recorded all my steps and mileage automatically, whether I'd got the app open or not. Since the last update at the end of May it no longer works. I can walk over 5 miles using it the exact same way as before, and it tells me I've walked zero steps. Its infuriating. It needs fixing, and straight away."
"The January update for the sleep tracker switching to a sleep score and what I assume is an updated algorithm is just bad. It definitely doesn't track well. I spent most of a night in and out of sleep and tossing and turning and it gives a sleep score of 71? Yet on nights where a sleep more fitfully and spend far less time awake I get scores of 43 or 44. The app was never great, but at least was consistent and more accurate."
"I used this app for years on my galaxy 7 and absolutely loved it. The version on my new phone, a galaxy 10, leaves a few things to be desired. No heart rate monitor, no spo2 tracker, doesn't show ""healthy "" steps - just generally less detail.The GPS is not nearly as accurate and I am even questioning the accuracy of the step and time recording. I thought upgrades were supposed to give more to an app, not less!"
"I recently switched from a similar-but-different fitness tracking app/device combo to a Samsung Gear Fit 2 and Samsung Health. It is less intuitive to use than the competition's app, and the social function is basically useless, but it does everything I need it to do and allows me to observe data and trends in clear, concise visuals. Overall I'm glad I switched!"
"Was working fine until last night. Suddenly not able to auto detect my exercises (walking, running), cannot detect stress level, sleep detail is missing too. Seems only heart rate and steps tracking is still working. How can I fixed this? Thanks for the response. I did not do anything but all functions are back to normal again after 2 days. Now I am happy and back to 5 stars, no more complains. üòÅ"
"This app basically does its job well; and gives you the control you should have. You can manage your health data with ease, or entirely erase all of it and start anew. Weekly reports are done nicely and sure are useful. Global/personal challenges, badges, achievements, etc. are extra motivations that certainly do have considerable positive effect. Yet, I'm kept from giving 5 stars for the lack of a simple but important feature: choosing the first day of the week. This gets added, 5 stars. üåπ"
"Very disappointed to find the weight management tool (wmt) has been removed. I started using this app in MAR2p018 and the wmt has been my 'magic bullet' in losing 160lbs. Being able to track calories in vs calories burned, I can literally say that I am now half the person I used to be. Please make it a priority and bring it back with the next update. Another suggestion, expand the number of items that we can add to the 'My Food' feature. 100 is not enough if you don't live in the USA! Thank you"
"Oh dear, the update has ruined a good app. The new layout is appalling, and would appear to have been designed by someone who never used the app or consulted existing users. It requires lots of scrolling and is not user friendly anymore. No longer able to see at a glance results recorded, or select an exercise activity direct from home screen. Old layout was simple, easy to determine what activity to record and see previous results. Now have to go through layers to record such activities such as cycling etc. Unless app changes the layout to a more user friendly layout, I will look at other alternatives."
It's a reasonably good app. technically it works good. my point of critic is that I lost all my progress when I changed my country of residence and lost all of my achievements after Samsung advised me to create a new Samsung Account. after that there was no one who wanted to support me. and the cheaters on the monthly challenges are really annoying and demotivating. when contacting them they are saying for 2 years already they are monitoring the situation. for 2 years. lies as they do not care.
No longer crashing but now workouts pause when my screen times out. I have cleared the cache and data (as instructed) and other than losing my history there is no change. Still pausing when my screen times out.‚òπ (Been working great for years and now all of a sudden I cannot set up a workout. App just crashes every time I try to start a hike or walk.)
"Before the last update, I would have given this app 5 stars. However, I can no longer sync my fitness pal with this app and this makes everything a lot more difficult, when it comes to recording my daily fitness info. The allow ""all permissions"" button does not toggle between on and off and stays off no matter how many times you try. Can you pleeeaasseee fix this, so I can change my rating to 5 stars. ****Update: Let me just say that was super fast and I genuinely appreciate it. Super happy."
"Its a great app in theory... The step count doesn't work. Sometimes it doesnt count at all, or records maybe an hour of activity. The sleep tracker doesn't work automatically anymore. The food tracker is a pain to find foods and adjust servings. I do however like that you can record everything in one place, however it's not simple and becomes time consuming due to glitches in the app. Very sad to not have accurate step data after going through the hassle of keeping my phone with me 24/7."
"I used to really like this app, and I still like it, but I'm increasingly frustrated with the pointless changes. Some layout changes do make it nicer, but some changes actually make it worse (no pie chart for activities, just a green circle). Either way, why on earth do you keep changing stuff that are perfectly fine as they are? You could put these resources into something actually useful, such as fixing the pace targets for running. Have anyone at Samsung that actually runs even tested the pace targets? If so, then why are pace targets displayed as km/h (speed) rather than min/km (pace)? And the cardio pacing is like half the run walking slower than my dead grandma and then suddenly bumping the pace to give you a heart attack. Please just stop tinkering with the UI and fix the running programs instead!"
"They basically locked me away from using my Gear Fit2 Pro: With the latest update I am not able to use it without logging into my Samsung Account, but even if I attempt to connect the app to my account it just takes my login information and shows a progress indicator that never ends. I did try deleting app data and cache and reinstalling the app, but the issue persists (btw: No, it is NOT my internet connection). Way to go, Samsung, you just soft-bricked my perfectly working smartband!"
"This app was working great until today, now saying it can't be used on a rooted phone. My phone isn't rooted, and I've never done anything to it since getting it in December. Not sure where that is coming from, literally overnight... I woke up and went into the app to enter my sleep hours and I just can't access the app anymore. I'm left with no choice but to delete the app after reinstalling it and getting the same error message. Too bad... ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
"Auto fill meals does not work anymore. Connection with Gear S3 lost, steps not shown. Terribly slow opening pages with 'trends' data for the first time: 10 seconds! To me it looks like the last update was not properly tested because I have not experienced so many bugs before. Maybe this is standard and this was my first update of the app? Also the process of reporting a bug to Samsung about this app is complicated and inefficient, and frustrating."
"the latest updates just took away from it's feature set. you used to be able to select ehat source you wanted to keep for that( like the watch or the phone), or to see more details about your data. things are now just moved around and options have been removed. maybe they are still there but are no longer easily accesible, like deleting workouts or auto tracked data..."
"There's something wrong with the data permission for connected apps after the latest update has been done. Please check as the data won't sync to the other apps like My Fitness Pal!!! I reinstalled the app and now it won't fully capture the data from my Galaxy Fit! The steps in the band is at 8k+ while the app only captured 100+!!! I still got the badges but it doesn't make sense since the data for step, sleep, active time aren't there!!! What is happening???"
"Often doesn't count my steps, which is really frustrating. So much so that I've switched to a different app. There was a lot to like, the monthly challenges for one, but it's disheartening when, after a 30 minute walk, only 10 steps have registered. I did as is suggested below, several times on the day it stopped working properly, and it didn't fix anything. Afterwards accurate counting was sporadic at best and couldn't be trusted."
"Great app. If you could add a barcode scanner on the food part it would be even better. EDIT: The only truly useful thing for me on this app was the weight management feature, which helped me lose 2 stone body weight. The app is pretty bland without it compared to others. Please bring it back. Its pretty simple, calories in/calories out. Thank you"
"I used to like this app a lot because it seemed very precise in tracking the length and slope of runs and hikes. However, I can't find the history of my exercise sessions anymore. They only go back to 30 days but I would like to be able to review ALL of my previous training sessions. What happened here!? Edit: I can't call that number because I'm from Italy."
"I was going fine but lately it's been to the point where I'm looking for a different app. I have met my weight loss goal, when I changed phones, the transfer and update messed up my settings. So I went to fix it, it show my weight and goal as being met yet there is no maintaining option. I can only choose to lose weight. If that weren't enough they reset my weight which cut down 600 calories of my daily allowance!"
"Most of the time works great, and tracks lots of cool stats. Other times, such as earlier this month. The app was locked up for 2-3 days. Then when the app came back. It missed 2-3 days of step tracking in the global step challenge and also missing the first star, then missing stars 2 and 3 and now the tracking was way behind. So you finish the month off with missing stars on your badge. Could've rolled the stars date back, or extended them."
"Used to be fine, but the recent updates have meant my watch no longer syncs properly with the app. When it eventually syncs there's always days and days of data missing, which is unacceptable. I do some sort of exercise every day, yet there's weeks of nothing in the app. The cynic in me thinks it's because I have an original Galaxy watch and there's obviously newer models Samsung would like you to upgrade to. I got my watch in 2019, I'd like more than 2 years of use especially for the price."
"Was great, now poor. The removal of trends/averages in the weight section have rendered that useless. Tracking weight daily to see trends is an extremely effective technique to drive behaviour change. An individual measurement alone is useless and that can be seen directly off the scales. The updated graphics and interface are harder to use and interpret. Luckily it's only an update away from being a great app again. Please update quickly!"
"Canot find how to show heart rate and time at the same time for running which is essential for my running. How come? No web interface to get a large view of results and other on PC. Not good, not motivating presentation of results for me. No data export to better apps like Polar and other popular ones. Both I estimate would be easy for Samsung to do. And during my search I found many others requesting this. But it seems that Samsungs prefers to block this on purpose. Now there are even less sync options through 3rd party sync apps with the newest Samsung restrictions (steps)."
"I enjoyed using this app until its most recent update. I liked that all fitness/health data could be tracked in one place and without ads, but this update has made things much more difficult. Not only has the Weight Management tool been removed, which was one of the app's main draws, the new interface too low contrast for users in dark mode- for example, food macros are all very similar shades of green, and so I can't easily see the percentage difference like in the previous version"
"For a beginner it is hard to keep on target with drinking water. i've downloaded several 'drink water reminder apps', but there seems to be syncing problems or I have to do it manually on both apps. I use the gear2 pro and it would help if one could have a reminder to dink water in this app itself. Also to have a option to monitor or measure heart rate at a given moment with the gear or phone. now if one checks the heart rate on the phone and one wants to measure it only gives the phone option."
"I, like most others here, am so mad with the latest updates. My problem is the tracking on the map when I'm walking and running. It keeps pausing for no reason, and it can't be bothered to resume the work out. A 5km walk shows up as 1km because it paused and didn't resume. At first, I thought the internet had poor signals but the reception was fine. I have been keeping my walk and run records for more than 5 years and this stupid update has ruined the continuity I've had. Fix it Samsung be quick"
"It's ok, has some nice features but is let down massively by the running section. You can set your target, wether that is distance, calories burnt, time running, I use distance. However when you achieve your target, it does not stop the clock, nor does it create a lap, it just keeps on counting, so by the time you get your phone out you actually have no idea how fast you've achieved your target in, which defeats the whole point using the app for training purposes."
"Pretty alright, used it for a solid couple months till I moved on. It's pretty decent and great to start with HOWEVER I wish they implemented a *BARCODE scanner to enter foods in to make things easier (rather than looking for something or typing all the nutrition facts in) and how much water you should be drinking every day with reminders. Other than that I hope they improve more on this app! It's already pre-installed and I hate having to install another one for a specific thing :("
"I don't get why you would delete the ability to look at the recorded weight by weeky or monthly basis. Daily change in weight fluctuates a lot which makes the info irrelevant. Now I cannot see the weekly average in the timeline when you had it perfect in the previous version. Please add the feature back. EDIT: They have even removed the weight management feature. This app is now useless, I am swiching to something else."
"Used to be a useful and reliable app, then updates erased charts and data, and the biggest problem for me is the list of permissions it now needs. I don't want to give my personal data about every aspect of my life (contacts list, my locations, access to all my files and data, complete access to my mic and camera and much more) to a step counting app. It's data mining and completely unwarranted. Would no longer recommend to anyone."
"The loss in the functionality has made this app basically useless. I used weight management constantly to keep me on point. Samsung cannot brand itself as an all in one app and then cut everything that makes it stand out from the pack. I regret staying brand loyal. Samsung has been promising for the better part of a month to fix this (see their response to me) and yet nothing, no update, no information on when it'll be fixed. Starting to think their lying about a fixing it. Still no fix more than a year later"
"Amazing app, it made me lose weight in a short time & got me in a better shape. I The only disadvantage is after the new software update 6.11, the weight management option has been removed. That was really not cool most of the app users depended on it to watch their calories levels & make sure that they are on the right track."
"I do love this app, especially when used in conjunction with other apps such as for macro nutrition. What I dont like is that it doesn't record broken sleep. For example, when I have a few hours then wake up then fall back to sleep a bit later having used my phone in that gap. It should have been noted but it only recorded the later block of sleep and inactivity."
"I like the app UX/UI and it has a good amount of features. It is reliable and doesn't crash. I am missing some key features, and therefore 3 stars. Some features I would strongly suggest are manual input of exercises with custom type, time and calories burnt and also, very useful, trimming some practices in length. So when I forget to turn on tracking or when I forget to turn it off I still have somewhat accurate records."
"The app is more or less ok, but the way it graphs and displays... Everything... Is basically useless. Also when inputting workout data when not wearing a watch, you can only put in very basic info like type and time, and not info like distance etc that might be measured on your machine. Also the period tracker has ""in love"" as a trackable symptom and not depression?!?? Overall would not recommend and next time will go back to fitbit purely for the app."
I have never managed to get this app to work so I'll be getting rid of my Samsung watch - no point to it when all the fitness data disappears at midnight! Tried contacting developers/customer service only to be given a long list of things to do (no surprise there then!) which still didn't work. Even sent them a screenshot of the error message but it would seem that it was ignored. How can a server error occur on 3 separate occasions? Better to head over to the other side and buy a Fitbit :D!
"The app itself has fine features. Everything I need. But like many Pixel 6 owners, it no longer syncs the data from the watch into the app (even though it says it has). I have to restart my phone and/or watch every time I want them to sync. A MAJOR flaw that needs to be solved. I never had these types of issues on my Fitbit..."
"App was only sort of Ok. Failed to auto detect a lot of activity, it was really hit and miss, was often easier and more reliable to enter data manually especially for cycling etc. Phone crashed severely and I had to do  factory reset, and despite having Sync Turned on lost three months worth of activity data, not exactly sure what the point is of syncing the data, if it cant be recovered. It's only now after the reset and uninstall that I've also realised how bad the battery drain was with it running all the time. There's better apps out there, even if they do have adds."
"Sleep records don't show anymore after the latest update. The only thing I can see in in app is the total hours of sleep but it doesn't show the graphs for light/deep/rem sleep even though I can still see them on my watch. I updated the app on watch, synced it repeatedly but still nothing. And all my past records have disappeared as well :( I am absolutely gutted!"
"Very disappointing. Heart rate monitoring has been changed so that 'continuous' option for graph is now unavailable. The only option is Min-Max now, which is mostly useless when trying to track heart changes, or look at specific activity. Not sure why the 'continuous' was removed, but I will be downloading the old apk, and turning off updates, which may cause a security issue, just to get it back. Obviously developer not very smart."
I switched from one of the leading stepcounter watches to the Galaxy ActiveWatch2. Im pleased with the device but the app has changed since I last used it. I prefer the layout and menu of the competition. I find the samsung app difficult to navigate and to find data. I'm gutted that the weight management function has disappeared. Entering calories is also difficult the database is not as complete as others and there is no barcode scanning option.
"GREAT APP, BUT COULD BE BETTER. Lack of workout selection leads to a few of us missing out. For example Samsung health has no skateboarding option, where as competitors do. And this request has been posed to Samsung since at least 2018, with no results. I'm sure there are plenty of other workouts missing, and Samsung provide the ""other workout"" but it does not track a lot of information that other workouts do, i.e. GPS. Some workouts track speed, some don't. Otherwise, a great app."
"Pregnancy mode needed. I use the app on my phone and my watch. I really like the amount and quality of the data that I get. The app is easy to use and visually pleasant. However, as I am pregnant, some of my measurements (such as heart rate) can't be compared with the norm of non-pregnant people. In the pregnant mode the app could focus on tracking paremeters and achieving well-being rather than goals. Also body composition option could be blocked."
"The new update is not as visually pleasing as the old one. I also find it harder to find things that I'm looking for, for instance, my total burned calories that day. I have to go through specific section of exercise to find that data, but it only shows for that particular exercise, which isn't convinient at all."
"Unusable for months due to autopause bug in the app. App refuses to resume workout even though all autopause are switched off. 5 mins in to a 3hr workout it will stop tracking you which you won't know until it's too late. Autopause settings not accessed from settings page which is counterintuitive. You have to start a ""walking exercise"" and from here auto pause can be accessed for walking, running, hiking, cycling. With all these switched off, the app still pauses when eg using mountain biking."
"It's a good app in general but could be unstable from time to time. For example, the app sometimes has a syncing issue with my Galaxy watch 4 and does not read the steps and distance correctly. This is especially problematic when I am on the treadmill, where the difference could be up to 30~40%. The issue was resolved after an update but came back after the next."
"I, like MANY others, am beyond disappointed by the latest update, which has removed weight management. Not only that, but the step count doesn't sync properly with MyFitnessPal, so I can't even use a third party app as a workaround...this has rendered my Samsung Gear virtually useless. As a result, I will be switching away from Samsung altogether in terms of mobile phone and wearable tech. Very disappointing."
"Some basic health marker tracking. It would be much more useful if we could manipulate the data more (organize by time of day, exclude outlier results, etc.) and change the settings on the heart rate monitor so it could take it results from a longer test. Just very inflexible on this stuff. Also, calorie tracker is a bit old-time, especially as there is no carb tracker."
"Probably the most important app on my phone. I also love the integration with the Calm app, I have the lifetime subscription and its amazing to access everything in one place though I will say the UI and the overall UX can be improved, it is confusing if not difficult to navigate back and forth as it is not easy to discern if a certain icon has an interaction associated with it or not. Even then, I highly recommend this app as it works well on both of my Galaxy devices - S5 and S9+."
Needs improvement. It was impossible to find my old account. So now can't add my other years. It doesn't tell you the km your walking now since update . And the new version I find harder to understand or navigate. And awesome suggestion would be to accumulate how far we walk maybe at the end of each month which would show us how far we walked in our state or country? Just an awesome idea as I can't find an app to log this ? Just an incentive seeing what we would be accumulating on a map .
"Good looking app with sleek and attractive interface. However, the app should allow 3rd party write access to the steps for better compatibility/more open ecosystem. In addition, the weekly summary trends should in my opinion show decrease in red arrows and increase in blue arrow, compared to the opposite now, which is less intuitive. 

And kindly include a feedback function in the app to report bugs or suggestions. Miband has it and is super good. Reported problems get fixed :)"
"I love this app, but please add an option to automatically disable step counting during an exercise. (At least the non walk/run excercises) I cycle a lot, and SH counts the ""steps"" while doing so. This leads to a lot of burned phantom calories, and thus unreliable numbers. Update: I can turn off my steps as a workaround now. Thanks! The option to pause the step count does't appear when you collect steps from your phone and smartwatch though. That's why I couldn't find it initially."
"As the last comment. The most useful feature is now missing. In fact it is completely useless without the weight management bit. It is what the app is about without it, it has no use. You have to be able to set targets and track progress or it has no function. This was a brilliant app I have been using it for months. Please bring this back. It is so useful for me recovering from Cancer and trying to gain weight it gave me a superb baseline and works really well. Please bring this back."
Really enjoy seeing the sleep function in the app and also heart rate. Started going on walks as well so that's been good to see. I have noticed recently on the heart rate that the option to see the chart as 'continous' rather than the bar chart. I preferred to see it as the continuous option but since the update it looks to have been removed. There used used be a button to change it from the bar chart to continuous but that is just 'share' now Glad the bugs seemed to have been fixed as well now
"Works just fine. I've been using this app with the Samsung Watch 3 for about 2 years now. Overall I really like the app BUT, there are a number of basic features missing. Once the watch has auto recorded excerise you can't edit the data, you can only delete it and enter your own. Auto detection of swimming just doesn't work. Swimming harder doesn't record as burning more calories, just swimming for longer."
"Had this app for years. Its great. Love all the features on it. I have been using it on my Galaxy s21 for over a year now and I've had no problems with recording my steps and exercise, as it syncs from my gear2 watch. I purchased a galaxy watch 4 to help with my fitness and was looking forward to a updated watch. I'm ¬£250 out of pocket and have a watch that won't sync to my app on my phone. Very disappointed as I can no longer use my watch fir its intended purpose. Hope to take it back."
Can't get past sign in. I enter my Samsung account details and I am met with a progress wheel. The app doesn't get further than that. Edit: I had to download an old APK to have access to a version of the app that includes the skip sign in option. From there I was able to sign in to my Samsung account through the settings. I was then able to update the app to the latest version. Poor form Samsung. I shouldn't have to put in that effort just to be able to use a ¬£200 smart watch as intended.
"Just because...kidding... The answer is obvious from all other posts. Like all other apps (ir remote, snotes, etc) they dumb it down to the point of uselessness. Removing features and change for the sake of change. Edit post reply: LOL. I don't have to call a number to know that your first versions of everything are most feature rich... Then you start cutting till it's just creepy data-mining ad platform."
"I prefer the older version of the Samsung health app as it was interesting to see personal stats against other users. It's a shame since I updated yesterday that this feature is no longer available. I don't like being forced to allow certain permissions to get an app to work when before updating, it was absolutely fine and helpful. I've noticed that with the updates, features change to the point where I seriously would consider buying a different phone AND smartwatch. Sad and annoyed. üòíüò†"
The app is OK. I do believe that Samsung can could invest more into the development and add functionality to the entire app. The entire design seems a little rough and not really smooth like in other apps fitbit for example. The overview over all the categories looks clumsy and could be structured more thoughtfully. Additionally I wish for the ability to click on the graph in each section and get bogger and more detaled few of all the data found there. I consider the tiny windows not enough.
"This App was great before the recent major changes. It's not as simple to use now and simplicity is what you want when preparing for a run. Also when running the pace time announcements are totally inaccurate and have become meaningless. It all tallys up at the end of the run but is very annoying. Bring back the old App Samsung. Samsung still haven't addressed the running ""split time"" issues that have emerged since the update. On a 5 mile run my pace varies from 6 to 20 mins per mile. Daft."
"Fantastic app, keep up the great work. I love the heart rate monitor mainly, but the other features are amazing too. Samsung is by far my favourite tech company, so sorry if I'm biased but either way this is a really good fitness app. It would be great if you could team up with Fitbit and/or Garmin to allow their fitness trackers to sync with the app but that's just an idea for improvement."
"I think it's a shame that although the watch detects when I'm gardening and registered as exercise, it doesn't have gardening as an option to choose from on the list. I work out more doing that than anything else but it's not on the list of possible exercises. Otherwise it's fine. If they had a feedback button in the app the certainly hid it well because I would have sent them that as an option."
"The app is doing NOTHING!! It's on an eternal refresh and loading! Doesn't record sleep, doesn't record steps, won't let you record your water intake... I tried updating it, looking for information to fix it, etc. and since I haven't been able to find a solution, I'll end up downloading another app that doesn't give ma all this hassle to deal with. I guess it was good while it worked."
"This app has great potential but has a major flow. When an exercise(cycling) is paused, finish button appears. Now, this button is very easy to accidently hit,and no confirmation is required to finish it. As a result, I accidently ended recording countless times and I'm getting extremely frustrated. Please do something about this. UPDATE:THEY DIDN'T EVEN BOTHER TO READ THIS REVIEW AND JUST RESPONDED WITH ""CLEAR THR CACHE"". Wow Samsung"
"Their latest update removed the ability to measure and save oxygen saturation on it's own, you have to do it via the stress test now, and it took ages to find out where the ox results were stored. I wish you'd revert it back to a separate measurement. Also, as someone else mentioned, you cannot remove the step counting function, which is really annoying if you are disabled. I haven't left my bed in months, yet the app thinks I'm training for a marathon...."
"Please, please fix the Strava integration. The app is not bad in itself. I use it with my galaxy active watch 2 and I'm content with the activity recording and sleep monitoring. But what I really want out of a fitness tracking app is the ability to share and compare my results with others. Strava is the number 1 platform. But SH integration with it is broken in multiple ways. Only running is synced to Strava, and GPS data is messed up, leading to inacurate pace analysis. Big sad."
"The recent update removed the ""weight management ""feature. I am highly disappointed with this removal. That feature has assisted me with being able to see how much I was consuming versus burning. I had a better understanding of what and how much I needed to burn in order to lose weight. With this feature removed I find the only thing good about this app is the food diary. The colouration that was done with this update is awful as well. Will find a new app to use and smart watch"
"In general, I have been satisfied with the app. However, following the most recent update, there have been random issues with the reporting of sleep. Although tracking of time in the various modes of sleep through the night seems to be working, the app is randomly reporting zero for the sleep score and in the explanation of the score, the bar charts shows zero score for the modes. 05/03/21 No longer reporting any sleep cycles."
"Would give it a no star if I could, since the latest update I've had nothing but trouble getting on the app. It keeps crashing, screen goes black, doesn't register anything if I can get on the page. If I'm lucky I can get access for about 10 minutes a day all for nothing. Total waste of time using it. Sort it out please because it's useless at the moment."
"Some good features. But errors too. I used app for cycling. Each time I slow down in traffic, it stops tracking and says ""Workout paused"". It resumes tracking only after certain speed is reached again. City traffic wont allow steady speed. We have to factor in the time used in pauses, else average speed is inflated. I also noted error in route tracking when I walked across an underground subway without network. Instead of pausing workout and resuming, it counted the road route and added a km."
I love this app for counting my steps and distance. However it doesn't allow me to record different stages ie I would like to set a distance starting slowly as a jog and during that jog speed up for short intervals and slowing down again and repeat this for full distance. So far it seems I have to stop moving altogether reset from walking to running and vice versa back to walking. I don't want to stop the activity. Recently started the inapp challenges and they are great to keep me motivated.
"It is not being shown in the notification pannel after update, i am not comfoert now, pls give it like before this, not samsung health started"
"I bought a galaxy fit band specifically to use the weight management feature, within a few short months you go and delete that feature! The only really useful feature in the whole app! I cannot afford to get another tracker and app. This better get resolved soon! I had a choice between the galaxy fit and a fitbit and I went with you (despite the fitbit's ability to link up with sparkpeople) because I have a galaxy phone and liked the compatibility with my phone."
"I used to love this app. But as of late it will not open. I am getting an error telling me I cannot open the app on a rooted device. This device has never been rooted nor does anyone with access to my phone have the technical knowledge to do so. The application itself is still running in the backround, as i am still getting progress notrifications. However, when I try to open to chekc my progress I am faced with an error and the app is forced to close. I can will change my rating on fixing this."
I liked the app when I had my note. Unfortunately the heart rate part doesn't seem to work with my Samsung A42 =(
"The app is fantastic. However, could you make the interface smaller, or probably an option to make it bigger or smaller. In my opinion, it is hard to scroll down only to select one of the feature. Apart from that, could you make 1x1 widget for oxygen, or heart rate or probably for steps (current one has no 1x1 size)."
"It's been weeks and I still can't access my sleep ""tab"". It keeps loading forever. I updated the app, restarted the phone... its not working at all. Please fix it, I really need it ! Update: still not working. Its seem obvious to me to update the phone and app if something isn't working properly. But usually after 2 months the bug is fixed... apparently u don't care."
Absolutely frustrating. Galaxy Watch 4 data does not sync and show up on phone app. Uninstalled and reinstalled numerous times but the problem persists after every few days.
"Wanted to try some of the app features but Uninstalled before even getting to a sign in page due to required permission of managing phone calls and number. I have zero interest in this ""feature"" and think having it required is stupid."
"Application is much better, everything is better, but you need to be added one option, 'RESET' option, if someones want to rest there steps he can, sometimes it starts unnecessary, so thats why i am not able to rest the steps that already starts."
"There should be an option to edit the time on which the first day ends,my walks sometimes extend pas mid night but I want to have the ability to adjust the time of what counts as the first day and what counts as the second."
A really nice app. Such a versatile range of workouts to choose to track. Almost all food items are also in the library so one doesn't need to worry about missing out on any calorie count. One thing though - the sleep tracking could be a bit better with telling you the REM and Deep Sleep instead of just the hours of sleep. But overall a great experience!
"Unfortunately, I was dissatisfied with the service as I got a message that the service was not available in my current location. Disappointed."
"After the last update, it doesn't work properly, it doesn't count the steps by itself, you have to open it yourself"
I loved this app and used it through several phones. October 1st I got a new phone (a Google pixel 6) and it will not let me past the login screen so my galaxy watch 4 is just collecting dust because the steps and activity tracking was my main use. Very disappointed.
Doesn't stay logged in. Doesn't keep information current. Difficult to track health history on. Horrible to use. Edit - so it started working ok for a few months but since the last update I can't even open it anymore. Is this going to be fixed soon?
Purchased a watch 4. The Samsung health app I have doesn't have Spo2 reading. I was contacted and given a number to call to get this remedied. NO HELP at all. They give me another number to call between 8-6. I have been a loyal Samsung user. VERY FRUSTRATING!
"Requires phone number disclosure for no valid reason. They want to create a social environment with your friends, I want none of that. I returned my Galaxy pro 5 watch because of this. Switching to pixel watch. Update to the reply: if that's the case then make it optional"
"My one wish for this app is that it had a fasting tracker, especially with intermittent fasting being such a popular weight loss tool. Fasting for health and detoxing is so important!"
Completely useless ecg app let's you see an awesome line go absolutely crazy on the screen hundreds of times over again! Not sure if it's supposed to be like that or if the app itself is a total failure ü§î help me out here devs could ya?
Ever since this last update my sleep tracker is useless. Everything is off. Last night it said my sleep period was 4 hours and 26 minutes but the time was 2:25am to 8:26 am. That's 6 hours according to my math and sleep says 3 hours 38 minutes with 58 minutes awake. In the least it should be almost 5 hours sleep. This has been off since the update on the 13th of October. Please fix this and give us an actual email to contact the developers instead of a noreply address
Health stopped showing steps and distance for treadmill workouts. It was tracking these parameters a few weeks back. How to fix it?
I am writing this review in hopes of updating the sleep tracker. I don't usually do anything like polyphasic sleep (sleeping in intervals) but I do wake up occasionally do something for an hour or so only to fall asleep again. It would be nice if it could be recorded plus if I could have the opportunity record naps. It would also be great if the calorie tracking portion could be expanded better to feature more foods.
"Was great... not so much anymore. the amount of info is fantastic but For some reason the app cuts out and turns my screen black when I'm looking through past exercise, it then won't re-open when I close all my apps and try again. Really infuriating bug that should have been sorted by now. My phone isn't old and is the top one for its model so surely it can't be that. Please sort it"
Ok. But blood pressure monitor is not supported in all areas. Why? I lowered the rating due to this. Please fix this.
I don't want my phone contacts accessed by this app. It should be optional not required.
Step count and sleep measures are not working properly. This is coming after updating the app recently.
"Love the app, just wish that the calorie tracker took Into account what your goals are and your workouts. And really wish it had a barcode scanner for adding food!"
I could have rated it 4.5 stars if I would have reviewed it 5 days back.... but since last few days the steps counter has gone fool... till last week the watch as well as mobile deta showed accurate steps data... but for last few days it seems to be doubling... I some how disabled it on mobile to show only data counted by one of it but the watch still shows double steps.... and nothing on net seems to be helping.... -Vaibhav J Joshi
The fitness section does not work and workout programs are not shown ....the number u provide to call says it doesn't exist please assist
"The ECG and blood pressure monitor app not working at all! I already downloaded Samsung health monitor ,and watch is still sending me back to enable this options. App itself have no configuration towards this options, so what am I suppose to do? You need to work on it so far I see there is a lots of other unhappy customers."
"App won't even go past first screen, just stuck on loading circle infinitely."
"Overall the app is quite fine, but what I totally hate is the fact that the info passed on to the complications from Smart Watch 4, are not actually info, but only shortcuts to the Samsung Health app. For example, instead of passing on the value of the heart rate measured at a certain point, it only passes the ""heart rate"" text :| Also, there's no ""total calories"" value available in the complications list."
"How to ruin an excellent app with pointless 'updates'...which only achieve the removal of all the best and most useful features and replace them with dumbed down second rate versions...well I've persevered but it's time, after three years to move on...shame. OK, the latest update has put the snack features back, which is a step in the right direction...now fix the pedometer which only seems to count one in five steps."
I use this app every day and I really like it. I am gutted though as some great features have been removed which means I now have to use other apps along side it which takes a lot of time. The diet planner has gone along with the feature that calculated calories burnt... I also loved the programs it used to have. There were also many other features... If these features were to be brought back I would give 5 stars.
"Disappointed with the gym selection. Not a lot to choose from with regards to the types of exercises as well as the platform. Nobody times there weight training. It's all done in reps and cycles. So annoying to have to stop the timer and restart the timer every time I want to gym, land up giving up on the app. Not cool at all. My suggestion is to upgrade the gym platform...."
"Why is the sp02 function removed? I recently updated to 6.5 and when I went to check my levels, it was gone. This is a critical component for me and was a deciding factor to stay with a Samsung phone. I have had to revert to the previous version to get it back. Edited to add your response is not at all helpful, the stress option is not even available in Canada. While I love my Note 8 maybe it's time to look at the Pixel"
"It's the best thing ever! I moved away from a hectic life, and gained 40kgs. I'm on my way back down, with a huge part of it being thanks to Samsung health being there, always! It calculates every possible thing food calories sleep steps it's really easy to use, as far as I'm concerned, there's nothing except a real life personal trainer, could beat this app! It's great!"
"Really like this app. I find it very useful and I've been using it consistently for a year now especially the weight management bit. Where has it gone!!! Please reinstate it. I am put off by the most recent update losses and the change to a garish, loud colour scheme. Please give us an option to turn back to the calming delicate tones and hues that were peacefully not fluorescently shouting in my face everytime I go to make an entry. It's like its angry with me now inatead of encouraging!!"
"You can't see all your workouts (only those from the last 30 days), so many workout types don't exist or can't be set on the watch (I don't buy a 200‚Ç¨ watch with GPS so I have to carry my phone!). You can't change the time/distance if your watch didn't track it right... The list is endless. For such a big provider for fitness watches etc. Samsung has very limited options for people who actually want to work with it. I have read so many feedbacks of ppl complaining about the same stuff."
"I really like this app and all the features, so I don't have to have a bunch of separate apps for food/calories, fitness, sleep etc. I like that you can add your own custom recipes. One big draw back is that all the macros are based on the old food guide of 65% of your calories coming from carbs. I eat keto and it would be really nice to have to option to set your own daily percentages for carbs, fats and proteins. Other than that it's a great app"
"Struggling to understand why the swimming function doesn't allow you to simply press a button to pause the swim - you have to hold turn the water lock off, then swipe and then press pause, when the watch face is wet! Which is impossible. Didn't use to have this issue on Tizen. Also gps tracking is not good, it weaves around all over the place, particularly when walking or running. This needs looking at. Sort these two issues out and it'd be 5 stars from me. Galaxy Watch 4 LTE."
It was a very useful watch for weight management until they removed the calories burnt feature. Now I use it primarily as just a watch and am unlikely to purchase a new one when the time comes. I've also noticed that the auto Goodnight mode seems to have disappeared and I need to activate it manually every night.
"You have rendered the application useless, and the investment in a new watch and Samsung phone a complete waste with this new update! And this is coming from a long time die hard Samsung fan. People look into monthly averages for sleep, and steps to compare, and you made it super unintuitive to scroll across the year, having to actually click each month to see the value. People want to compare how well they sleep and their steps, in a glance!! The slick UI at the expense of functionality!! Bad"
"I have been using on my Galaxy watch to track my weights work out and I have been incredibly disappointed. Menu set up terrible. Even when you select the correct exercise and get in the correct position it fails to detect the movement. Awful awful app. Look at the Google one for inspiration, this is useless. Nowhere to record how much weight you are using."
It no longer shows my weekly summary and doesn't record all mywalking. Started January 29th.
"Very disappointed with the latest update as I need to click through to see numbers of mg, g, etc for Protein, Potassium, etc per day. Also nutrient score is gone, and it used to push me to eat healthier. I need to track Potassium and it is not as easy to do so anymore. The old system where numbers showed on the main screen was much quicker. Also, morning snack, afternoon snack and evening snack are now just grouped into one - it was really useful having them separate. Wish I didn't update."
"Up until recently there was a Weight Management feature, this was a very useful tool for helping with weight loss as it gave an indication of calories used versus intake. With the aid of this I managed to loose over 15 kilos. This feature was removed in one of the updates and although there has been mention of it being reinstated its been over three months and its still not back. I keep the app updated in hope but am very disappointed that this has not been resolved."
"I thought this was a great app, for about 12 months. Then it started deteriorating with some parts losing their functionality - my step counter is now useless, my exercise tracker only works spasmodically and now rarely tracks my whole route, the nutrition tracker changed and is less useable, and then yesterday the stress and blood oxygen tracker just disappeared completely, and it's not in the settings so I can't just reselect it. Very frustrating. I want a new one."
"Have been using this app for a year. Recently (not sure if it was after the phone system update) it can't detect my running distance. On the map, it says location is detected and as I run, the cursor on my map moved along. However, there are no distance, pace and calories recorded. I ensured that location info is allowed for this app already. Have also tried uninstalling."
The graphing for weight in the latest version has lost the functionality to view by week or month. This renders it effectively useless. The need to record daily weights is limited to a tiny number of people with medical / eating disorders. The vast majority of people record weight weekly and need to be able to view trends over months and years. Please can the previous version of graphing be restored.
"App is OK, but there is a lot of stuff included that most will completely ignore. My complaint is that the auto detect workout function gives a completely incorrect distance measurement for walking, and fails entirely to record the distance for cycling. If you manually activate a workout session it does record distances and track route correctly, so it seems to be a bug that it doesn't record properly using the auto detect function. Also altitude readings are consistently low by 15m."
"I've gone from really liking this app to trying to find an alternative. I cannot, for the life of me, understand why you want to combine the step counts of both the wearable and the phone. You could select either the phone or the wearable or indeed combine them if you so wished up until the last firmware. but now the only option is All Steps.. it tells me I've done 10000 steps when in reality you've only done 5000. Not very helpful and ruined the app."
"The app randomly creates an error which thinks my non rooted Samsung S8+ is rooted. When it gets like that, the app will not even load. I have to uninstall/reinstall/clear data/cache and reboot my phone. Then it decides to do it again a couple of weeks later. All on a Samsung device that's not rooted. Other than this hassle, the app is great when it functions. I will update to 5 stars if they can resolve the errors in a future update."
I really like using your app as a guide. Although it's quite annoying to type in a food and it prompts frozen foods or take away options before the 'real food'. Also i don't think your weight management diagram is correct. It makes you feel like you haven't achieved your goal. I ate and exercised and it sat on 'good' but half hour later told me I was under and to eat (i didnt feel like eating and it was 9pm). Also every morning Its always over 500kcal. From a motivation point of view it hinders.
"its stopped counting my steps accurately, I've just walked 5 mile and according to the app I've had 8 minutes activity and walked 0.42 mile,I prefer to use the manual one as it give a more accurate account but even the automatic one isn't working. it seems to have corrected itself, the top of the layout I was only seeing the ultimate workout ad but now I see both with cycle yourself happy plus it was buffering like it couldn't find the information, not sure if that's what caused it but thank you"
"I don't understand how the app works for some of the smaller but really seething I used to use it for, since the update. I used to set a reminder 15 mins before bedtime, but now it just asks if I want a reminder, then the pop up comes through 18 minutes after bedtime (weird amount of time, I know!). Glad to have the activity tracker working again though, mine hadn't updated in months!"
Been over a year that the sound from coach is the same output as media player and it's so annoying when it also states dumb motivating things with no options to separate it or the sound. I want to use it for runs and listen to music without this bot always talking things I don't care for listening. If only there was the option to declare how fast I need to run without all the rest and control the volume so it doesn't interfere with my music all the time. Oh well
"Nice app, but I am not a fan of the latest updates either. Just got my Galaxy Active 2 watch a couple of months ago and started using the app to track my bicycle rides. I love the new feature of being able to view all three speed, elevation and heart rate in one chart, but I do not like the colour scheme and new fonts. The major issue are heart rate zones, with double digits (minutes and percentage) not being visible. They just simply do not fit on the screen and the app does not rotate."
"Nice health app, but too American and with hiccups I love the trackers, food database, walking challenge and the way you can customize it. Sadly enough tips come in the language of your sim card and you can't change this. Food database is too American. You can't track your training over long period of time or get overviews in graphics. Goals are too American as well. Europeans don't always have to be the best or greatest. We do things for fun as well. üòä Your answer is no answer. Just a template"
"This app was once great. For 2 years, I had all my workout data recorded, and i loved it. Now, i get an error every time i open the app. I looked online for solutions, and I ended up deleting the app and reinstalling it... same issue. But now, I've lost 2 years of workout data. Lame. Was it an update to the app that ruined it? Im not sure. Please fix this app. It used to be so good! Galaxy s8+ user"
"Doesn't measures steps in a week or month, just gives average data for the month/ week . There is no yearly data as well. Doesn't counts total steps walked thus far. Something like million steps or two million steps is very inspiring. It is supposed to be a premium app and is the only option for a very expensive Samsung Galaxy Watch but gives very basic data. They should allow compatibility with other third party apps or upgrade their current one. Disappointed."
"This app has really supported me to lose weight. I loved the feature that allowed me to see my calorie intake v energy expenditure at a glance , with suggestions for how long I needed to walk / run to get back in balance. It also took in to account the balance i needed to loose weight over a certain time. Now you've removed that function it's useless. Why meddle with something that was working so well? I was recommending it to my patients for weight loss, I won't anymore unless it is amended."
"Why no zero stars? Where to start, this seems like it was built by a child. How many bugs can I report. It crashes 95% of the time within the first second. The only way to stop that from happening is to uninstall. Then the log in crashes, and the password cant be pasted in which is a nightmare, when you use a password manager and you have to long in 15 times because it keeps crashing. I would have deleted only for the stupid watch 3 needs this app, absolutely disgraceful."
"I like the app but is lacking a few things that I think it could do better, health metrics, my fitbit does oxygen variations when sleeping cant find it on this one, plus the fitbit I can also access all my data on my computer or mobile, where for this one its only on the mobile, plus have noticed its not got all my data back form last year and the year before, just the last month or so and as I scroll though I am noticing data that should be there isn't there, and I know I was wearing the watch and had my phone with me. Only thing that changed was I brought a new phone a year ago. I only reason I keep using my samsung watch is it looks far more better on than my fitbit does. Has more a professional look, and as I work in retail I like that it looks good."
"After the latest update it just decided to automatically pause workouts even though I'm on the move (walking). It is very annoying to listen to ""workout pause"" when I'm less than 3 minutes into my walking routine. Also since I've installed the app it always asked me if I wanted to run the app at the beginning of my workout since my ""GPS signal is weak"" when I'm in a wide open metropolitan area in a major city in El Salvador, Central America with perfect reception. I feel truly disappointed."
"It used to be fun but since June 2021, the app isn't counting my steps properly. I have another step tracker which is more reliable in counting and everytime on SH I have almost half less than what i have walked in a day. Of course, this is affecting my results in the challenges. Why is this happening? Now, it says the service isn't available and it is not counting my steps of the day into the challenge. It is not a network problem, since I'm posting this, it's the app. I'll lose the next star"
"Out for my run this morning and and, after finishing, opened the app as usual to measure my heart rate. Got an error along the lines of ""Could not set up app. Couldn't connect to server"". When I got home and connected to my home WiFi and opened the app again it popped up a screen asking me to accept their new T&Cs. It then loaded the interface, with some idiotic idiotic new animations along the top of the screen. Thanks Samsung! That was really worth blocking the whole app and messing up my training this morning for, just so you could have me tick a box and inflict some infantile animations on me."
"I WAS loving this app!! But since the August update, all the good functions are GONE! I used to watch my steps count as I was walking (gone), I used the weight management to help me stop eating before bed (gone), I used to see the time of day when I was most active and set reminders based on it (gone). So sad - there really is no functionality left."
"Fixed problems by uninstalling and then reinstalling. Now works OK again. - - - - - - - - - Used to work. Now it doesn't record steps properly and results from the previous days go missing. I have paused and restarted the app, rebooted the phone etc as advised. Makes a difference and then it fails again. There's a bug that needs fixing which has been introduced in the latest version. Please fix and release an upgrade!"
It can be very good and has some brilliant features. A couple of times in the last week though I have been walking and it has suddenly stopped and restarted or not started at all. This is annoying as when you are trying to clock the walk you dont then know how far you went. I have looked to see if I have all the updates and i do
"After the recent update, this app doesn't work anymore. It is not able to pick up my movements to count the steps and distance. Just keeps pausing even though I was walking. Removed my case thinking it may be insensitive for that reason but problem persists! Now I can no longer use this to track my daily walks and weekly summaries. Very unfortunate and disappointing! There seems to be several feedback on negative outcomes. Why don't you reverse the update or fix these issues?"
"Extremely frustrated with the removal of the weight management feature that provided a visual net calorie count (in vs out) as this was a key feature in helping with weight loss. Having used this feature for 6 months and now nearing my end goal, I was very disappointed to see this change being made and fully agree with other users posting reviews since the 'upgrade' as this needs to be reinstated...."
"Since the update, I'm stuck with a constant notification telling me I've achieved my step target. I deleted the app and reinstalled it, and now I've lost my day's step data and am stuck with a notification telling me to go for a walk instead. The notifications can't be swiped away and it's very annoying having them stuck on my phone all the time. I had no issues before updating the app and wish I hadn't now"
It can no longer track a work out and who knows why that change happened - was it due to the last bug fix? Auto pause kicks in even when walking and shows for example I've walked 35mins and maps the entire route but says I did 0.17kms. Clearly it's not working. It is also temperamental generally when changing battery access. - Thanks for replying. This number is not a local number and with hold/wait/call duration times I will not be calling but do appreciate you responding.
"This is great application. I am swimming and its keeps me motivated. Swimming section of application gives me detailed information on every swimming parameters and it is easy to see your progress. Thank you, Samsung! One more thing: can please add option of swimming exercises information export let say to Excel? It could be great if you can do that. Thank you in advance!"
"I've used many other fitness tracking apps and Samsung Health displays, in a user friendly way, most of the features that are standard with other apps. With one big exception. With the strong focus on heart rate zones as a training tool these days, there is no ability to edit your heart rate minimum/maximum. This needs to be fixed asap or Samsung users will look elsewhere for readily available options."
"The app in its old design was extremely efficient to use, wouldn't take you seconds. However now, it takes me so long to do everything, that I find my self using it less and less, before I would track my water intake, do regular heart beat and stress level checks, add in meals, now I rarely do any of those things apart from the meals which I begrudgingly force myself to do from time to time, even though I hate using the app in its current form. I have now deleted the app and downloaded the apk of the previous version, so much better."
It just won't map your routes be it run walk or hike. It bit like most Samsung software pretty average. Compared with just about any other smart watch software for sports tracking it just is not there pretty useless. I wished I had looked up before i got the watch. The inability to map is old news and all over the internet. Samsung seem to care less. Very disappointed.
"I do like the app and the detailed data that it provides but there are few basic issues which makes it look like an unpolished app for example: 1. When I try to setup ""My Page"" and upload my photo the orientation changes. While croping the photo it shows one orientation and when it gets applied all of a sudden the photo is rotated 90¬∞ and the resolution is low. 2. I am unable to edit my DOB in the profile section It is really annoying to see an app from such a brand having these basic issues."
"Regarding my last comment about this app, I got a Samsung active 2 with my partner after being with fitbit after many years. I enjoyed using the watch although I found the app to be lacking in a few areas such as it's interface. There is no colour or life into its design. Don't get me wrong the app is very simple and easy to use for beginners who never used a fitness app before. I just hope for some improvement in future updates."
Very disappointed that in the last month the app has started adding 'friends' without my permission. Just because they are in my contacts does not mean I want to see their steps - and I don't want them seeing mine. Its a breach of privacy! One that was added by you is my boss! Not good! Turn back the clock and give us back the helpful app we had before the latest upgrade or two! Please do not suggest a number to call - I'm outside the USA. Edit: your answer does not address this issue!
"After the new update, I cannot see multiple sleep records in the app for the same day! I have the app syncing with Sleep as android, and I also have a watch tracking my sleep. Before the uodate I was able to see the graph for both, but not anymore! Also, the sleep trakcer's trends tab now does not show the graph for earlier dates, which is a big step backwards!"
"Very upset with the latest update it took away the main feature of telling me how many minutes of exercise I need to do to burn my calorie intake. I've enjoyed using this app and I've lost so much weight using it, but now it's taken aways the key feature which I've relied on a daily bases, i hope they bring back this feature as its so important to me, this was an absolutely brilliant feature for me to keep track of my weight, if this could please return it, and I would rate it 5 stars"
This app is amazing especially if you combine it with the smart watch. It helped me track my active time and helped me stay fit. The monthly challenges with people from around the globe is so much fun. It has many other features too; like meditation and special fitness and diet programs. It even has sleeping stories and music. Simply amazing; I am very happy that I installed it üôÇ
"The app has good potential. However basic things does not work. There are major problems casting the exercises from the app to the TV using SmartShare function and ChromeCast: The video is not stable, and audio disappear or sound fragmented during the exercise. This problem does not happen when streaming video from the phone on YouTube app, for example. Also SmartShare seems to work fine, but the connection with the app is not working well on ChromeCast.  Also I would improve the exercises videos by adding more audio instructions during the exercises, to direct the users so that the user will not have to always look at the TV.  I would add an option to the users to add feedback per each program and per lesson, to allow requests for improvements and report issues when found, e.g. do when doing an exercise on the left side and then do it again in the video on the same side, by mistake instead of the other side.  In addition it takes too long to the app to load. I think that it should be lighter and load faster. Also not clear how I can view and download my data history from dates longer than last 30 days (view / download exercises etc., doanloda heart rate, etc.)."
"It can be the best health app of all... But is not. Sleep recorder, VO2, HEART RATE measurements are one of the best. Problems, ONLY CAN SET 3 SPORTS! . You can't edit the sport autodetection (most the time it set a wrong sport), and one of the worse things you can use it with another were able gadgets than Samsung's (I have the Samsung's phone is one of the best, but the watch isn't) It can't synchronize with other app like Strava or Garmin app. But it can with food's calories counter."
"Same as the Gear app from Samsung where I have to disable battery optimization to have it sync properly with my Galaxy Watch. If the optimization feature is enabled on the phone, the app when launched will not see the watch or sync even after multiple attempts. If I just don‚Äôt sync the watch, I risk losing all health data as the Gear app may forget being connected to a watch that forces me to reset it. The health app is a bit more reliable compared to the Gear app but is a battery hog. With optimization, the phone would last 36 hours on a charge with light usage but with that option turned off, the phone needs to be topped up every 18 hours. Maybe its time to move on. The Galaxy Watch works great BTW. Just poor software on the phones spoiling the overall experience."
"Love the app. Would prefer some better functionality. For instance when entering food. It seems if you enter one food, then try to stay in the same search field and select a 2nd field during the same entry, it locks up and won't allow you to. Its intermittent and the easy fix is leave the food section, all the way out, and come back in and it works. However when you are busy trying to enter your meals its very annoying."
I have used this app for years on my running route and the distance measuring is now way out. It tells me I've completed a kilometer when I know there's still a good way to go. I thought the update would fix that but it hasn't. Frustrating as it has been reliable for years and I can't now measure progress or times as I know the data is wrong.
"I've turned off marketing, but have suddenly starting getting ads from Samsung that are irrelevant and block the settings at the top of the screen. When I tried to contact them through the app, it wouldn't let me until I'd agreed to receive their marketing. Rubbish when you consider I didn't even download the app (it just came with the phone) and it doesn't work with Fitbit, the market leading tracker, because they want you to buy a Samsung tracker instead!"
"Incredibly comprehensive, does GPS run tracking, calorie counting, and everything else other health apps do. Much better than Google's version. I hope they continue the good work. UPDATE 3/3/22: more cumbersome to use after aesthetic changes I that it takes much more clicks to accomplish the same task. And now doesn't sync data from my Samsung smart watch. Such a shame. Used to be 5 stars."
"Very frustrating that the weigh management feature has been removed? This was excellent and one of the best features, especially when paired with my galaxy watch. I cannot understand what a feature like this would be removed... Updates are meant to improve an app, not to keep removing good helpful and useful features. Please bring it back!"
"Since the last update, the notifications system has been completely botched. A constant notification about my steps isn't helping. if I completely disable steps notification, I don't get target achieved. Sleep recording notification somehow not coming up any more, so for the past few weeks, no data. Pls stop responding to call you to solve the problem, just provide a solution. We're not the ones always wrong: I didn't change settings, I just updated the app and it fell apart."
"Useless app with conflicting information. One section says I was under my calories for the day, and another section says I was way over. Sleep info says no data recorded, but when I go to record, it says data already recorded. Very inconsistent information, doesnt sync well with other apps. Very disappointed since I just got a galaxy watch and this is the platform it syncs with. I wish it synced with Hidrate to track my water so I dont have to do it manually. Very disappointed."
"While the previous user interface was ok-ish, now tracking specific exercice requires you to go through way too many screens. I mainly commute with my bike, and now I need to go through several screens and wait for a very noisy timer (that can't be disabled) in order to track each run. A simple shortcut/widget to start/pause/stop would make this app so much better, most of the people I know who were using this app decided to stop due to the lack of auto tracking (for cycling) and the times it takes to start tracking."
"Update: The app has long required access to your contacts, presumably as a way of verifying your identity. In fact, it was accessing the unique identifiers stored in your SIM card. Previously, it only required access to your SIM card during initial set-up and then it would just run after that even if you temporarily removed your SIM. The newest update will crash if you ever remove the SIM to use your phone as a simple WiFi terminal. (I do often.) An error message would be better than a crash."
"Well the app gets the thing done. But it was 5 stars when I had S8 a couple of years ago, guided running programs, with keeping the pace, instructions for keeping pace, warming up etc (although it lacked many features that are present now). It seems that audio guide was heavily downgraded, which was my favourite feature, now I am looking for app with better guide and programmes not just workout targets. P.s. even sound synthesis for audioguide got worse."
"Like using this app, but when are you going to let us manually add exercises? Sometimes I forget to turn on activities, would be great to be able to manually add it, and go back to a day I may have missed!"
"Generally very good, I would have given more stars if it included barcode scanning of food for nutritional info. The loss of the carb intake in grams for the day is a significant loss for the app. The calorie intake/output balance gauge was also very good, and a real shame to lose that feature. I have sadly deducted one star from my review the app because of the loss of valuable features."
"I use this app to track my daily food and exercise, no issues so far. I don't like how she talks to me when I'm walking or if you stop at traffic lights she says exercise paused. Is there a way to turn this off? Edit: Used the FAQ to find the setting, which you have to actually tap on the exercise option then find the settings. From there you can turn audio guide off. Still think all settings should be under one settings menu to make it easier."
"After the update, a two step verification is required. Even after doing the two-step verification, it does not log into the app. Now the security blocks the access to the app instead of adding extra security"
"I have been using this app from more than 5 years, a quite active user indeed. I have changed my phone multiple times in the past but was able to sync data always. There was a forced update provided to me, and that has literally screwed up my device. Cannit find any data that I have hard earned in last 6 years. Been writing to Samsung from billions of days, but customer support team doesn't care. Of course why would they, they are busy sending random scripted machine message. Uninstalling!"
"Pretty accurate and well designed app. I have been using it for recording running sessions for about 5 years now. The app does not start properly after the last update (on 5th April 2021). Also, the audio guide has often stopped working suddenly. Audio guide settings are difficult to find."
I Love this apps capabilities. I've never had any issues using it. I wish it was compatible with my Motorola ( new phone) . I loved being able to log my vitals and weight at Dr visits.
"I use the app to track my steps and distance as well as mapping my walk. However the distance calculated by the Steps area is different to that calculated by the Exercise area. The last one by as much as 2km. How's that even possible? It's 2 areas within the same app! Switched on at the same time, so no explanation for discrepancies"
"Great app however, there should be an option to remove ""friends"" permanently from the app instead of just blocking them. The app syncs my contacts and adds ppl in my phone book that I don't want to be on my shealth app such as co-workers, associates or ppl I've met while out. Adding that feature would do really well. Other than that, the app is great, I've been using for years now."
"I liked this app a lot, but now it has stopped working. No sleep recorded or steps counted. It has happened a couple of times now. Unfortunately, I may need a new, more reliable app."
Might be a good app if i could sign in without having to set up all the two step verification B.S. but whatever would I do if someone got into my account and learned how many steps I took in a day. Absolutely useless security features make the app unusable. 0/5 but they make you give one star.
I find Samsung Health to do an adequate job of tracking my health except it does not track pickleball üèì which is I play frequently.
"Doesn't have and option for people who work night shifts. By this I mean it cuts my daily progress in half. My day starts at 8pm and ends at 6am I want to see all of it on one bar not split between two ""days"" an option to set what my day is would be nice. Not to just end it at midnight."
"Trouble with weight graph resolved by a very informative customer service rep. My fault entirely, very satisfied!"
"Every time Samsung updates, phone or this app, steps doesn't record my steps. I should be at about 7000 right now and I'm at 3500. I've walked all day at work and several 30 minute periods of zero steps recorded. Get your updates correct before you send an update."
The app is good. But there should be option to switch between different workouts without finishing. Useful for different sets in-between
"Needs the ability to quickly toggle between your weekly targets, not just steps, but calories burned too! Severely lacking behind the fitbit app."
"Like the app but don't like the fact that it counts steps while I'm driving. I drive for my job. I'm constantly stopping and getting out, so it's inconvenient to have to stop and start steps through out my work day."
"Set Bedtime mode to a 12 am-8am, saved it. Decided to change to 1-8am, saved it but the settings reverted back. Disabled the Bedtime mode only to have it turn back on! Today, I looked at my phone in the afternoon and saw screen was in black&white and it put me in Do Not Disturb mode which I have never used. Seems very buggy. I deleted the Bedtime settings (creepy that it turned itself back on) and uninstalled the app. Pls DO NOT let an app decide to turn itself on."
"Absolutely the worst health app and product available. Buy a Fitbit, and have a usable app."
"The two step verification is the worst security system I have ever seen in my entire life, it's invasive and practically made it impossible to log in the app in my area, as there is no signal. Moreover, the idea of changing password every half a year is simply stupid and impractical. It's my first time the logging system made me uninstall the app."
"Went up from S9 to S21 but got downgraded in functionality accessible from the phone. No longer have the ability to measure stress, blood oxygen and heart rate from it?? Was quick and easy to check anywhere anytime. I get the functionality is still available in the watch but not looking to go and have to spend another couple 100 on purchasing one. Will have to do some research on better alternatives."
"The BEST health app out there, Samsung does not get enough credit for this app. It's the most detailed and informative app they have made. I love it and the fact that it's all free (from what I use) is icing on the cake."
Sleep time is messed up! Randomly out of nowhere it's like the time zone changed and I can't figure out where or how to fix it. I check my sleep tracking at 7:30 am and it says I woke up at 2:30pm though my watch reads 7:30.
"The app would be so much better if you were able to customise which items are part of your daily activity heart, for example the previous items of activity, active time and calories was much more realistic for myself whereas the current steps, calories and active time is much less realistic for me."
"The app doesn't allow to login within it. During Sign-in, it just opens up a new web-link and even after signing it there, the app gets stuck overall."
"Ever since the app updated a few days ago, it no longer counts my steps. Making the app pretty much useless to me."
"This app was working fine. It's great for steps & for sleep recording until.. Recording my sleeping pattern the only thing is, in the last few recordings this happened. I'd album my phone just before falling asleep. Once I woke up I'd recorded it. Lately it's been telling me I've been falling asleep 2 hours after albuming my phone! Which then I need to edit. I shouldn't have to edit my sleeping pattern but I've had too now for 2 weeks or more!! I've updated the app!!"
"I enjoy using this app but the list of workouts lacks popular workouts like HIIT, interval training, free weight workouts, and calisthenics. But does include kite surfing and hula hooping. Hula hooping??? Also the calorie burn is wildly inaccurate for many exercises."
"I wish there was a way to completely disable it running in the background. Also why is there a ""steps paused"" notification? I don't want it counting steps on my phone full stop."
Bug: Unable to watch fitness videos (YouTube link) in full screen (landscape mode) as auto rotate not supported and have to watch videos in portrait mode.
"Come on guys, with each new release the functionality of the app just seems to reduce. First, there is no way to add a non samsung smart watch or fitness tracker, then you disallow third party apps from syncing steps into the samsung health app, I dont walk with my phone everywhere! So it's my tracker that shows accurate data! I'm trying to use the app, as I like its design and ease of use But ill be deleting it now, its just a waste of storage and messes with my health data as well."
"I am not login in the app, it is continuously showing processing failed I have tried 100s of time but same error..........üòí"
"For get to stop your work out, out of luck. I mean why would they let you move a pin like one can in Google maps. That would be so hard. Multiple workouts ruined because they ha e an extra mile from driving."
"Needs a better sleep graphing system. I want to be able to see a weekly average of actual sleep time that takes into account time awake and restlessness. I dont necessarily care about my total sleep time as it doesn't help me reach sleep goals. A ""readiness score"" similar to fitbit would also be helpful - something that takes into account sleep and prior exercise to help you determine current days exercise"
"The app seems to be giving a lesser step count since the last android update. About 1000 less steps for the same amount of walking I do every day. A couple of times it even stopped counting altogether for part of the day. I'm baffled. It's been good up to now. Using on Samsung A7 (2018). Thanks for the suggestion. However, it still seems to be under reporting."
"It stopped counting steps, tried everything to get it to restart, still not working"
"Every since the last update it doesnt track distance, steps or calories in the treadmill."
"I'd love if there was a ""quick add calories"" option. Sure I can do that by adding the meal, but I mean not even displaying carbs/fats, etc. for the day or meal if it isn't relevant to me and just letting me input a number quickly. Maybe an option to toggle the rest out, I don't know. Hard to explain I guess. Another thing I'd like is if you could edit the servings for manually added foods such as ""cups, ounces, etc"". Only gives ""serving"" as a serving size."
I've always loved this app and even got a Samsung smart watch to use with it a few months ago. But now Samsung have changed it and taken away the weight management widget I'm going to need to get an entire new system. Its not just about losing weight. That widget brought together all the different aspects of my lifestyle in a way that was really helpful and useful. It was a main feature of what made this app so much better than the competition.This has had a really negative impact on my life.
"I'm glad people are up in arms about this. I refuse to be shoehorned into accepting permissions for access to managing and making phone calls for an app that is required for my galaxy watch! This is a possible tipping point in the never ending shift towards less and less control over your own software which has more and more control over you, it's irrelevant why the permissions are ""needed"" in my opinion. Software is in an exciting time of interconnectedness, let's not be controlled by it"
"I live alone. Why do I have to set up a screen lock. And if some one does get ahold of information about my ecg,,,, SO WHAT? I would like to use your app, but I AM NOT going to set up a screen lock that will only slow down my operation of my phone."
"I have had this app for several years and unlike some have never had any problems synching it with my Samsung Galaxy watch. I have noticed however that it only automatically records exercise intermittently on my Samsung S20. For example yesterday, it said that I'd not done any exercise at all. However, when checking the number of steps for that day, it had recorded over 16000 steps,and walked 7.5 miles! (which was about right). I have now reinstalled the app to see if that helps."
"Permissions for phone calls is now mandatory. This is ridiculous, and the privacy policy states that they basically have access to absolutely everything on your phone, from contacts to your internet browsing. I used to use this app everyday to track steps and diet and thought it was a good free app, but I'm not going to let it ""make and monitor phone calls"" FFS"
"Have been using this appt the past 4 to 5 weeks but it seems to be inaccurate data on both sleeping and calorie counting. For example it says I got 45mins sleep for the whole night last night. Which I know for def is wrong. The calorie counting is also not correct. It doesn't seem to be updating properly. no bar code scaner for calorie input can't sync with other apps, very poor app in this day and age , I've removed it"
"Randomly tried this app again a few weeks ago and it works. Not as efficient as it was before, but better than that rooted phone error that was constantly coming up Since the last update rooted phone error keeps popping up about every 30 seconds, next to impossible to do anything on my phone. No, I won't call your 800 number. Fix the app and I'll redownload it. I actually enjoyed its features."
"I really like the app. The redesign just took some getting used to but it works for me just the same. Wish I could add my own sports to the tracker (like Netball). Also, I would like to include more data than just weight, such a visceral fat, muscle weight, waist size etc. To get more balanced health information."
"Unfortunatly,, last update is a major step back. During the time, I got used to the interface, which first seem to complicate, but now I realise it was an asset. Now, it is way to simplified, weekly report is with less data and so on... I am aware that this world is going in favour of idiots, but I was hoping that Samsung does bot go in that direction... Finally, I'll stick with SH a bit more, waiting to see your next move, but even now I am close to search for alternative..."
"Since the last update, it runs extremely slowly, especially for inputting my favorites and/or my food. I have to wait for the list of favorites. I also noticed that previous meals don't show anymore! I liked being able to select previous meals when I had leftovers! I follow the steps settings, applications, Samsung Health app, storage, clear cache. Unfortunately, nothing changed :( Greetings from Lithuania!!! Liked it before more."
"I'm joining the long queue of many annoyed SH users in regard to the loss of the Weight Management feature. Really can't believe the update has taken it away. The very thing that keeps alot of us going is this feature. I recommended this app to many of my friends, pre-update, but now feel I can't possibly continue. (slow clap/sad face ensues). üëé"
"This used to be such a good app, but the latest update has really ruined it. Can no longer see weekly or monthly averages, the healthy pace data has disappeared and the layout is less user friendly among other things. Really disappointed and also annoyed as I don't feel this is going to meet my needs and am going to have to look for something else when this was working so well for me previously. Also the new graphs are useless! And Samsung's response are useless. ""Call us"""
"It became impossible to use this app after the update! Tried to log in, can't do this without setting two-step verification (why I can't skip it?), started it's setup, got the error. Tried again, was waiting for the code by sms, it didn't come. Tried to get code via sms again, it came. Entered it into the field, button ""Verify"" became inactive. Reinstalled application, proceeded to the two-step verification, got message that wrong code was entered too many times, so I need to wait 30 minutes."
"This app is terrible! I've had problems from time to time where the app won't sync, which means I lose my data. With this new 'update' every time I unlock my phone I'm prompted to enter my password in the app. Even though I've ticked the box to remember me. To make things worse, the developer contact email in the play store is a no reply email address so you can't contact them! Goodbye Samsung I've had enough!"
"New interface is horrible! You need to scroll a lot; less information is shown; clock goal indicators are gone, charts are only in week view (I loved browsing timeline and comparing days/weeks and months for total avtivity/ stepcounter and separate exercises - also gone) Why my favourite activities are off the main screen!? - quick access was the coolest thing in previous interface! Do bring back the old app! If there are any people who like the changes (which I seriously doubt) make a separate version for them; but leave millions of users functionalities they used on daily basis. It's a shame Samsung is destroying one of the best sport tracking apps there was :/ And don't you try writing underneath that you don't get it and I should call you! Do the reading, count the bad reviews you got since the update and bring back the old functionalities and interface!!"
"I'm slowly improving my health, no pain but lots of gain but seriously wondering about the step counter, I feel like I've covered a lot of ground but it isn't reflected in the step count where once I trusted it, now I question it's accuracy. Also, really miss the oxygen saturation - it helped me to manage my asthma meds. Now it's gone, along with bedtime monitor, I hardly ever bother to use the app anymore. Waste of time."
The app works flawlessly when it works properly. 90 percent of the time it's not able to connect to my gear s3. Every other app and notifications works just fine. I'm not sure if this is just me or a general problem. I'm on latest version as of writing this review. Apart from that the programs are great. I wish this app was as good as Mi Fit. So much that I hopelessly tried using it with gear s3.
"The problem is very basic regarding our possibility of interaction with it. A very few things cam be done. For example, today I started to rope jump and finished to start a stretching. Just remembered to press finish after 10 minutes. Now I will have this time recorded forever in my history because it is impossible to edit it. Also it just allows to connect to samsung gear and not to heart monitors straps for example. Also, unfortunately, food calories counter is very worse than Myfitnesspal."
"It use to be a good and reliable app, but presently when you open the app it crashes and can not view your progress or view your day to day activities. I hope they fix the bug because it was an excellent app for motion and easy to use. Well I gave it 3 stars but I would edit my review ones the issue has been fixed. I am hoping it would soon."
"Not bad but graphics are a bit dated and need to be better. Also some people are just superheroes and can do more than a 1,000,000 a day so it becomes a little pointless. But it is good because it records your stats and keeps (me at leadt) focused on trying to maintain a level of fitness"
"I love my new Galaxy Active 2, and - by extension - this app. But one thing that is annoying is not having a smart alarm... The watch is collecting data, but can't use it to wake me at the best time? Even my Pebble 5 years ago could do it. Would also be nice to set more than one alarm, for different times and different days."
"I use this app every day but now that they've removed the Weight Management feature it's pretty much useless. No reason to remove the best feature of the app! Also the nutrient intake summary colours changed and they're so similar now I can't see the difference between carbs and fats. So frustrating. Why update an app to make it worse? Update: the last update was bad enough, but this one in 2021 is even worse. Terrible layout, snack options removed, it looks so different. Thanks, I hate it."
"Hopeless. I used it for first time when i purchased the new galaxy watch. First time i used it, it worked very well. But it has never worked since. No steps recorded, no heart rate recording, try to start a workout and nothing happens - usually just crashes. The reason i bought the watch was for fitness. I've found that the health app stops the watch from receiving notifications too. Basically i've found i've just got a fancy looking digital watch now."
"Recent update is awful. Now I can no longer log into the app as even though it gives me the option to skip adding the two-part login (where it wants my phone number), it errors out & won't log me in! What is the point in having a performance watch when you can't see any of the data in the app?! This is the final nail in the coffin to return my galaxy watch & return to Fitbit. Edit: Samsung's response ""add your phone number and it will work"" gives me no other option & is holding my data hostage."
"Ever since the update, I can no longer seem to connect my Fitbit Charge 2 with Samsung Health. I find this upsetting because I prefer using both to monitor AT LEAST my sleeping patterns (I even disregarded the fact that it doesn't sync other data like my steps, etc.) I was thrilled when I found out that it syncs my sleep data because it gave me a reason to keep the Samsung Health app."
"The update is a huge failure. Sync to Strava has always been temperamental at the best of times, but now it's even worse and they've taken away the ability to link up with other apps that were able to sync as a workaround. This app needs a manual sync option to force upload to Strava if the auto sync fails. Looks like I'll be switching my fitness watch to a Garmin"
Has upgrade changed stuff for the worst. Logging food is so much harder with extra button presses and the food selection screen appears as a smaller box rather than whole screen. This makes selecting things to troublesome. I have a Galaxy fold phone and even on the large screen it shows up as a small box on the right hand side. Can only read few letters of food items. So yesterday I forgot to select a walk but was confident my watch or phone would pick it up as an 'auto' but it didn't.
"Not sure what has happened but it really is not very good now. No longer can get totals for weeks or months or even years , just averages. I would have thought at least step totals would be a basic function. I also preferred the old layout with clear boxes for each  tyoe  of exercise rather than just a list of what youve done in the last 30 days  Whoever thought these changes were a good idea needa to be sacked, a big step backwards"
"Great but need some extras. I would like to manually be able to add muscle, water and bone percentages for those that have the scale that measure this. It would be great to be able to track those numbers. And body measurements. And also add trampoline to exercise please. I have 3 different apps to track all these different things but if I could have this in Samsung Health I'd get rid of all the other apps. Other than this I really enjoy the exercises & the app as a whole. Really awesome app!"
"When I had my S7, this app was unbelievable. It did my step count, taught me how to run, and was probably the most versatile exercise app on the market. However, now with my Oppo, it continually signs out, won't do my step count, and constantly asks for updates. Coupled with the fact that I get all my messages in Chinese instead of English, and I can't set the voice alert to a British English speaking person, this app is slowly spiraling for me down the proverbial loo."
"Crashing constantly on start up since upgrade. Uninstalled and reinstalled app and kept my fingers crossed that my data would be preserved, which it was thank goodness. I have therefore upgraded my rating from 1 star to 4 stars. I use the app daily to record my calorie intake but find it tedious to search for food items and select from drop down menus. If I could scan a barcode to add the food items I would gladly give a rating of 5 Stars. Also, I would like to create my own recipe by combining ingredients from the drop down menu. I would then like to be able to weigh the amount of my recipe I have had for that meal time. At present I have to edit every single ingredient of my recipe from 'my food' depending upon my portion size rather than just saying how much of the recipe I have had."
"I can only agree, the new update is super annoying. After loosing the weight management option a few months ago, now the weight tracking is also gone as well as the snacks. It's becoming more and more useless, also because the food database is not adaptable to countries. I'm considering to replacing it with another app."
"This app used to be pretty good. With the latest update, what was - for me - the best feature has been removed, leaving a (sub)standard app in its place. The ability to monitor calories consumed vs. calories burned was extremely useful for weight management, and I can think of no good reason for this functionality being removed. Please bring this back, Samsung - it was by far the most useful feature in the app!"
"Last update was not good , lost of some good tracking data, sleeping report is poor now."
"Since you last updated your app, access to all records since first using it, is no longer available. I record weekly walking sessions and details of ALL records were saved. You now only enable one month of viewing and full details of recorded results i.e area/location, in the last recorded item so no areas walked show any record of speed, incline, etc that can be viewed and compared to previous data - something that was ALWAYS accessible. Without access to this info it seems a pointless"
"Removing weight management was a blunder. The app disappoints everyday ever since. -Step counts are not as accurate as they used to be. I would be walking and looking at the screen when the count suddenly freezes for a few minutes and then starts again, completely missing the 200-300 steps I would have covered in that duration. This happens every 15 minutes. -The exercise section skips work out records as it pleases. I would work out every day of the week and it only shows 3 days of exercise."
I love this app! I like its different training programs especially the running coaches. Monthly challenges are also fun. Especially the added community feature. There is only one issue and its the number of cheaters. The first ones have step numbers that is humanely impossible. It makes the honest users disappointed after awhile since they never can make it to the top. I hope you can find away to eliminate possibility of cheating and remove cheaters from leader board. Then it will be really fun.
"The app used to be great. Now the app keeps crashing, takes an extremely long time to load data, and keeps resetting the step counter throughout the day. Very frustrating... Samsung, please fix it! Update: I've followed the recommended steps by the developer a few times and I'm still experiencing the same issues."
"Disappointed, I cannot get past the updated privacy notice. It's made the app unusable and it used to be great. Update - Samsung have suggested I contact them through the app. The suggested path doesn't exist in the app. Will be uninstalling because there's no way to get it to work again. Real shame because it worked well before the privacy notice update."
The main feature that I loved for several years was the fact that I could use my phone to check my heart rate... but the app doesn't do it anymore. I have tachycardia & the app was very helpful in me keep an eye on my BPM
"I use this app to track my distance targets, speed, activity minutes and steps. I use the measurments in the imperial mode for feet, miles etc. I have found that the app has been changing the measurements from imperial to metric without notice. When I try to change the measurements back by going to settings the measurement page is blank. This is annoying and time consuming as the phone needs to be restarted in order to bring back the measurement page. This is on two different devices."
"I love this app, its interactive, it's easy to use and it works well. The only 2 reasons I put 4 stars is because; 1. the food tracker can be frustrating as the food options aren't always there and you can't customize portion sizes. Not a big deal tho :-) 2. Watches other than samsung can't be linked to it. I have a samsung gearfit2 which links, but if you have a fitbit, striiv or any brand other than samsung, you can't link it. Would be great if you could!"
"Not sure what happened to the updated version but I just cannot log in to the app. Once I input the credentials, it just keeps giving a never ending loading screen and neither I am getting a skip option. I was able to use this app earlier but now it's a mess. I am seeing that people across the world are facing the same issue but they get skip option and are able to login through menu screen but I am not even getting skip option. I have tried and wasted 3 days time but all in vain."
"I've been using this app for years on my old Galaxy S5 without issues. After transitioning to my new phone the latest version requires a Samsung account to work at all. That alone would deserve a bad rating (I don't want my health data attached to any account, there is perfectly good local storage on the phone, keep using that). But it gets even worse, signing in with the new account doesn't even work. Had to use an older apk just to be able to use it at all."
"Was great up to a certain level and used it a lot. Now with new permission requirements, it seems I need an app that gives me a choice between user experience and access to data. I didn't even start, blocking access to my years old data!. Bad choice Samsung. Hoping for smarter decisions in the very near future."
"I installed this app yesterday and so far I think it is excellent! I know its going to be a really helpful tool in monitoring my health and weight. I gave it 4 stars because when asking you to fill in your active/exercise data, it doesn't give the option of inputting data after you have exercised - it only allows you to turn on a timer to log when you start and then stop it when you stop. My activity is often spontaneous (like running all the way to work for 15 mins) so that update would be great"
It's amazing. I love it and it's awesome that there are different features like meditation and workouts and challenges. I really like it. Previously I used Fitbit and the only feature they have that I think S.Health is missing is female health. It would be awesome to have a period tracker within the app like Fitbit had. But besides that it would be amazing.
"Good, but I won't use it. The app is very detailed wirh good tracking features but i personally will never use it because the food diary does not include a barscanner feature. For this reason I will always stick with MyfitnessPal. It does import some data from MFP but it transferes ALL meal data into one meal group (not each meal individually). Also, it does not import all of the macro nutrients either, only some... Give it a go, you may like it but this is a deal breaker for me."
"I love using this app very much as it very comprehensive and neat. With just few tunning evey thing will be great. A very important thing from my point of view is to have an online website too that I can access and import and/or export my data. Also, solving the syncing issue with the comnected apps. In my case, sometimes it takes days to sync an activity with strava. May making a manual sync option will be an alternative if the automatice fails."
The latest update removes weekly and monthly averages from weight and blood sugar measurements. Makes both of these somewhat useless as progress and trends happen over longer periods of time. It seems to me that every update removes features. Kind of the opposite of what most developers do. It also didn't measure stair climbs. Another feature that seems to have been dropped an update or 2 ago. As I said features are dropping off as time go on.
"I am really saddened to have rated this app 2 stars, because I've used it reliably for years... But for the last 2 months, the app keeps pausing during my runs, even though I do not pause. Some other times, my pace is VERY far off to what is normally would be while running as well. This made using this app extremely annoying and impossible. Customer support: I have deleted the cache, I have reset the app, and I have taken off the autopause. Nothing works. Will not call your customer support."
"Using this with a Galaxy watch active2. Would be nice if it was a little more like the Garmin Connect app in terms of how the data is visualised. For example, press and hold heart rate graph. I think the garmin app is much easier to read the data quickly somehow. Also, why can't there be a single app to control the galaxy watch in terms of the health side and watch settings. Just consolidate two into one."
"It's more difficult than it should be to alert a bug (even in the app store, the developer contact email is a no-reply address!). I see than 90% of the time the app does not correctly calculate the heart rate zones based on my age. They are correct on my Galaxy Watch and then sometimes correct on the watch for a brief period, but usually displays incorrectly. Despite repeated error reports to Samsung, nobody ever replies..."
It's not great that you updated the app so I can't use the oxygen sensors that my phone and few other models (s9) have. First of all it's the notion that my phone isn't mine - cause you can do whatever you want with it's functionality. Second choosing not to update something that is two years old. Third and most important - there is the thing with covid and how it messes with ones oxygen blood levels - the sensor might have been a way of crude diagnosis - far from perfect - I know the many limitations of the sensor - but could help with decision of calling or not calling health care provider. But no. You decided that just leaving something and updating so it won't become some hacking hazard is too much. Thanks for that.
"I'd say that this app made me healthier because I feel like health is now more competitive and I'm trying to actually boost myself to achieve for example a badge in a challenge. Also, the app made me exercise more. But, I have recently noticed that some people that were on the monthly challenge leaderboard, have walked an unbelievable amount, and made me wonder if the people are actually walking that amount or they are cheating. Very sorry if I'm wrong, but I wish the company will have a look."
"I'm borderline underweight and have been using the app to gain weight. It worked great and I loved the app. However, just yesterday I decided to update it to the latest version and ever since then, half of the time I open the app, it keeps showing the nutrient requirements for men instead of for women whenever I try to input my calorie consumption. It is starting to be problematic."
"I have never ever written a negative app feedback before, but I cannot believe Samsung could remove the weight management option. If someone can explain the logic behind it, I would appreciate it a lot... I got Samsung watch and phone just recently, but I cannot believe I am already considering scrapping the watch. I was not very happy with the pulse tracking, which was a pain when running or doing HIIT, but removing sth that worked is just another level...!"
"This used to be a really useful app for weight loss - helping to balance food intake with energy expended. The latest update (5 Aug 20) has taken away this facility. Why? It was a brilliant way of taking control of your own weight loss regime without dieting. Please, please reinstate it. In the meantime I'm not using the app at all and am searching for a different app to replace it üòï UPDATE: Here we are 8 months later and, despite Samsung's original response, they have done nothing to improve."
I loved the app until the 5th of August update! The visualisation of the excersice history is now awful! What's with the dot as the indicator of the amount of exercise? Am I supposed to measure the diameter of each dot to be able to compare the amount of excersise between days? The bar visualisation was so much more intuitive and straightforward. Is there any way to switch it back? Also the whole visual appereance of the excersise history with the digital numbers is so unappealing.
Despite auto step count being enabled it is often not recording steps early in the day. It is also showing an annoying permanent notification on the home screen for steps. I want to be able to turn it off. The automatic to prompt recording is sleep duration and quality has gone in favour of the permanent display of steps (that doesn't always work). Annoying.
"I love the app. The only thing missing is an option for who really needs to keep their sleep in check: people with insomnia and with little kids. There is no option to add multiple entries in one night, which makes useless for me, honestly. I keep it up using paper! To see if I get the minimum sleep per night ( while the logs in the app seems perfectly fine :7 hours of sleep). How to add the 5 times I woke up - 25 min. Each? And then when you lost + 40 min. Sleep in the middle of the night?"
"Very ordinary fitness tracker. Doesn't even give basics like annual totals for steps, floors etc. Only reason to use is that it's the only one that syncs with Samsung watch As suggested you can go to trends but the only options are days, weeks or months. No annual total or year by year option. Surely anual totals are very important You can go trends but the only option are days, weeks or months. No years."
"It's brilliant, I've lost 2 stone and now it's helping me to maintain my goal weight. However, the new update has removed the weight management feature which is the most useful part of the app. I noticed another bug fix but you haven't reinstalled the weight management option. Please put it back!"
"Great app all round, which is better still for the myriad of devices and other app interconnections. The only thing I would change is to be able to amend a workout if it's recorded automatically. For example, on my Samsung watch I selected 'cycle' for a workout as I couldn't find 'mountain biking'. Post my ride, and using the phone app that had sync'd the data, I realised I couldn't change it from cycling to mountain biking. Otherwise, all good!"
"So, so limited and left me disappointed! Some of the sports / activities on the phone app do not appear on my Galaxy Watch, which is very annoying when some of these were what made me decide to go for this watch. The UI and functionality could learn a few things from Garmin Connect app. This seems to be a theme with Samsung as both this app and the wearable app force you to do too much on the watch when it would be so much easier to do it on the phone. Just let me change and manage more of the content and functions like titles of exercises, layout and some of the watch display fields in exercise. I will look forward to the generic Samsung response......."
"Samsung has disabled the Oxygen Saturation function from this software if you are outside the USA, thereby removing this functionality from my S10 plus and all phones equipped with this sensor. I had to find an older version of this software and make sure auto update was disabled to get this function back. During COVID-19, it is even more vital that we have this feature. It is either Samsung wanting to push their wearables or had some issue with having to register the phone as a medical device."
"Can't add sleep more than one time a day üòÖ Well, introducing new bugs this time after update. Step counter not working. So a star less this time"
"The app is mostly ok. I don't like the ads on the top, they take too much space. I get a daily reminder about my calories intake although I removed that item from the dashboard. The sleep tracker asks me to rate my sleep but this information is not consolidated in the stats. The stats are not displayed in a meaningful way."
"I had this app on my phone as a way to count steps and found out today that it had been unknowingly deleted off of my phone with an update, for how long I don't know. I'm annoyed that I thought it was keeping a record of my steps especially after a long walk today only to find out it was no longer on my phone"
"Even after several updates, I keep receiving an error which does not allow the app to run on a rooted device. However, my device (Galaxy S8) isnt rooted. Please fix this issue, it's been several months now. For those with a similar issue, I recommend using an older APK/Version of the app for the time being."
"When I switched from Fitbit to Samsung Health, I was impressed. I'd say almost as good as Fitbit, but with a far better looking watch. However, the functionality is slowly being eroded. Using the watch & Samsung Health app to track fitness and 'health' (you'd think the clue's in the name) was the reason I own the watch & use the app. You can't even link food & calories to a weight goal anymore. That's totally nonsensical! Sounds like more features are to be culled soon too. Shame."
If Samsung wearables had proper support for Strava etc I wouldn't need this app. But it does upload to Strava eventually. It would be useful to be able to turn off or hide the features you don't want to use. I want to track walks and runs. And that's it. I don't want to see features like glasses of water etc that I have no intention of using. I also don't understand why the app calculates times and paces different from Strava when both apps are running on the same device. Which is right? Are either of them. Another issue is that Shealth does not map your route unless you are using a wearable but Strava does without. Again. Why not?
"Very disappointed to report that the workout is no longer functioning for me. I enter to start a new workout, choose an activity ie walk or cycle and when the distance screen opens, it cant take any input, just remains frozen with a ""detecting"" string appearing. Then it bombs out. I've been in and cleared the cache but that made no difference. It had been working fine. Sent the feedback on previous crashes as well but it's no better today."
"It's okay, does most of the things one would expect it to do. Would get a higher score if Samsung wasn't arbitrarily locking features off for those who don't specifically have Samsung phones."
Took forever to open and set up the app. Don't know if it was just my signal or what.
Never could get to work. Followed all directions. Others tried and couldn't get it to work either.
Really liked that you could check heart rate and oxygen levels. Had to get a new phone and that feature does not seem to be available now.
"The app was great, apparently till 3 days ago the app won't sync with my Samsung account and won't track anything. I have never had an issue like this before. My phone just did a system update this morning and the app still will not sync nor record anything. I have tried logging into my Samsung account and updating that but it still will not sync and it keeps showing ""updating"" but nothing is happening. It is so frustrating. I'm thinking of downloading some other health app that tracks step"
"Syncing with 3rd party apps had worked, but for two extended periods (months), it stopped. After submitting data log & receiving no feedback I left two negative reviews, each receiving a bland, standard response. I eventually uninstalled all updates. This lost some records, but reset to an older app version which worked properly. The app then updated automatically & switched off all data sharing. However, this time the functionality was there & I just had to toggle the relevant switches."
"New version. No weight trends anymore. I have usesd it only and only for the weight trends. Thanks for the answer, but I do not need a help desk. It is a question about the disappeared feature. It is not possible to see weight trends per a week or month anymore. It was the most important feature."
This app used to automatically record steps and work outs on my last 2 phones. A few days ago I had to replace my phone due to damage. I'm using the same make and model but the app says that it is paused. It won't record steps or work outs and it won't start again. I've tried changing all of my phone and app settings but nothing. Rubbish!
"I was using Samsung J7 Prime till feb 21, it was excellent experiance. Since i changed to Samsung A71, it is big problem. It is not tracking in Auto mode, every time when start walking have to wake the app. It is not showing in msgs. App is up-to-date. This app is Rich in features for recording instances for future reference. Can you add one feature to Track my path of walking? Where I am walking/moving, like if one is at new place exploring, and wants go back to start point. Thanks.."
Worst app. Wants to do 2 step authentication but the reset password button doesn't work
"Cheaters continue to cheat in the monthly challenges, and steps are not being counted accurately. I closed the app, walked 50 steps, opened it, and it counted like 20 steps....... for an accurate step count, the app has to be open while you are walking."
"The app used to show your steps when you swiped down. Now it just shows ""Samsung Health Started""."
"Excellent, highly recommended. I make reviews on every app I use and every store I visit on Google maps. This is a no spam, 100% recommendation review. Step tracker is accurate, but I carry phone in back pocket, so it may be different if you carry in a purse or on a waist clip, I don't know. Workout videos are quick to load ( on basic wifi) and shown at a pace easy to watch and follow. If you wanna tone or shape muscle/ body mass this is the app."
"Use to be able to check my heart rate using the camera on my phone now I can't use the heart rate monitor without the watch, so no real need for me to keep the app on my phone. The app is of no use to me anymore. I can do everything from my watch."
I loved using this app and after upgrading to samsung 23 ultra I can no longer use it as I did before it will not measure.
"The app's fine, however it lacks personalization options. Would love to change tabs order or exclude some info on workout report screen. Like, I have no interest in graphs, but have to scroll down a couple of screens to see speed. It's almost quicker to dotge math to convert pace into speed, then find actual speed. Also need more then 3 fav exercises and something like HIIT or general power workout on the list. Cycling doesn't register automatically."
"After latest update it has stopped showing km I ran , I can see km in total step count but not in running, how do I fix this?"
"So disappointed that the app has been downgraded. I have used it since 2016 but don't think that will last for long. It's no longer the health app it once was üò™ Until today, I was able to monitor my calorific balance, input vs expenditure. That is no longer available in the latest version, as you know. It's very sad because that was the very function that set the app above the competition. Please reinstate it üôè"
"Totally disappointed with the feature of rubbish 2-step verification. I've got the verification code, filled it in and then nothing doing. Tried a few times as I thought there was something wrong with my phone only to find out that the app is the actual problem. I can't even complete the verification even with the verification code given. What a waste of time!"
"I'm sorry, you don't need to have my phone number to share with others. Response to your response: Can you explain what an ""optimal experience is""? Do you use my phone number for other LOB in Samsung? Are you using this information to market to me within the Samsung ecosystem? Can you please share with me how exactly my phone number for a health app give an ""optimal experience""?"
"Slightly more than useless with newer models. I used this constantly on my S10, S20 and up no longer support the key features/sensors."
"Good But Needs Improvement, The Together Chat was So Good! Seeing everyone's posts it was Huge Motivation, BRING IT BACK PLEASE! Where's the fitness program for walking challenges? Will give 5 Stars when the options are there. Please make this more exciting to open every morning."
"Needs to many permissions that aren't necessary for it to work. Needs ""contacts"" to look up other users? Requires a two step verification? None of this should be needed to access health data from my watch. Time to switch to the Pixel Watch."
"Can't edit my sleep times. My Galaxy Watch 4 counts me as asleep when I'm awake but not moving, and there's no way to correct it. I used to have a Fitbit, and this was easy, so I'm really disappointed."
"blood oxygen level constantly fails around 50% and cannot get any accurate results unless i vape or do something to decrease them to at least 90% b02. response: what help in using the app do i need? oh, do you mean talk to them so that they can gather data? because that should not need a phone call...."
"I have mixed feelings. One day, it works great. The next day it has inaccurate steps. I've erased everything and tried starting over, still isn't working properly üôÉüò©üò§"
"I first use this app on my S10, it works well then. Nowadays the app does not react even though I open it the whole day. The app was updated recently (a few days ago). So I have no clue why the app does not work as it should."
"I am unable to log in to the app on my new ZenFone 9. I used a Google account to create my Samsung account, but the Google OAuth login does not work. I would prefer to use this since I already have a history on my previous Samsung device, and the app worked well there."
"Asking for phone number, verifications 2FA... I don't f.. want your ""together"" what are you Facebook? All of that to get access to my data collected by my accessory, do better! Unless the app becomes stand alone with options to connect elsewhere, I find the app to be to vulgarly invasio to use."
After an update the app won't work without allowing permissions to phone so that itwill allow *othet* who my number is in their contacts to find me in Together. If I knew I wouldn't have updated the app.
"Won't transfer data to new phone. Tried for a week now. Years of data gone. Other apps n games transfer instantly. I'd consider this a lifelong important health app, and for Candycrush to be far more efficient is just sad. And why remove weight?"
The recent update has messed certain features in the app. Used to be able to choose my start of the week day and now can't find that feature as it's defaulted to Monday and I want it to be sunday
"The app is great, but there are cheaters that use the together part of the challenge. This needs to be looked at. Currently the leader is at 320000 steps done in 2 days... please look into this."
"Great app, feature rich, and saves a lot of time. Can you include the nutrition facts for vitamin pills, adjust the calorie limits based on weight loss/gain goals, and allow us to set reminders on meals?"
Sleep times are totally off .. I have it set to go to bed @10:30pm and wake up at 5:45am and it Shows that i am going to bed when I actually wake up and wake up when I am going to bed. When I try to manually change it it will not allow me to..
"Does not record steps correctly. I ran 5km - in exercise history it shows 5712 steps but steps on home screen only has 2817 steps. This is now a recurring problem. Phone, watch and app all up to date."
"The app has recently stopped accurately measuring my running distance, adding on 2/3km to each run and logging faster times and pace. Really disappointing"
I have been using the app since 2017 without any major issues but since November 2022 I get asked all the time to agree to the terms and conditions as if I just downloaded it. Please do something about it! This is a very helpful app and I want to continue to use it like I did till now.
"Can't even try to log in, says that my browser is unsupported, even though I have tried all the ones it says will work. Older apk lets me try to log in, but it just keeps spinning after I enter my account info."
"Weak, food tracking doesn't work, customization doesnt work, no pathway to get support unless you give them a bad rating on Google Play, then a phone number miraculously appears."
"It's trying to force me to use this app to open a jpeg. After unistalling this app, it won't let me open the jpeg I need. I've tried re-downloading it after unistalling the app and it doesn't work."
Good app and features but alot is restricted to non Samsung phones so would not recommend buying the watch or using the app till this changes. Won't be buying the watches again myself due to this and not recommending it to anyone that asks about the galaxy watch range .
"The whole time I had a Samsung phone, it worked fine. Now I've switched to Google - it's unreliable and doesn't track my sleep."
I used the app to track my workouts but now I need the app to share step information through HEALTH CONNECT but it doesn't work for that. I would be grateful if this could be fixed on the next app updates.
"Why can't I sync with my Watch 5 Pro? Using S21 FE. You know how I got it to work? All OPTIONAL selection MUST be selected. If it's optional, then why wouldn't the app work if I choose not to agree?"
This app will NOT capture snore data. I have everything set up according to your instructions and it will not record snore data. Very disappointing
"The ever elusive blood pressure feature still MIA, Samsung appears to be giving their customers the runaround. They keep moving the goal posts and I'm getting tired of it, time for a Class Action Lawsuit! I bought my wife the Watch5 and myself the Watch5 Pro specifically because I was told it was already available, they just didn't say NOT in the USA, this is false advertisement and against the law! Beginning of the year they said the end of this month, now they are saying the end of next month!"
"Could always see the route I walked and now it's not showing the route or map anymore. Checked on the wife's phone if all our permissions are the same, still no map but she gets it on her phone when we go walking. Such a hassle"
My Galaxy watch isn't tracking my steps and now with the new update my phone isn't either. Totally unclear where to check and see if the settings are configured well.
"I love this app before the recent update. Workout from today disappeared-totally lost, can no longer check heart rate or edit the log to add the workout information. PLEASE FIX THIS ASAP"
"I like the app, but I've been trying like crazy to get an update that tracks sugar intake. If you all could add that I myself and others would greatly appreciate it!"
Why the hell aren't u guys backing up women's health on the app anymore!? It's part of our health which helps me track a lot of stuff I need for my doctor's appointments that I usually forget if I don't have that stuff on this app
Sync/backup always lets me down. I opened the app for the first time in a while and nothing has synced to the cloud.
Edit2 They don't read this I already called you have no solution. Just canned replys to make it seem you care. You don't care. Edit...I called they donot have a way of fixing the water ounces or the step problem I wish I could give a -5 rating. It needs to be more user friendly. The water measurement is based on 250 ML or 8.4 oz will not let you change this. It tracks steps on your phone and watch I only want the watch not my phone it won't let you change that.
Why did this need access to manage phone calls? Wildly inaccurate- O2 saturation always at least 5% under and fluctuates terribly. Step count seems to be a completely random number.
The initial Samsung Health App was beneficial and useful. This new Samsung Health App version is trash. It's below basic. I Uninstalled it. It's a matter if time before Samsung is out if business and Apple takes over!!
"Now it came to be just nothing. One day it had been a real addition that helped me a lot with the perfect oxymeter, calories calculator, stress measurement but Samsung turned into the evil of money grave. Sad for you, it will be the steps to your end"
Excellent. Thanks Samsung For Making Best Fitness Tracking Application In the World. Trying Many Apps But Samsung Helth is Best And Accurate. Workout Auto Pause And Resume its Golden Feature. Want A litle Fix I Am Start Walking And Cycling Workout Together. Cycling 1 Km Just Walking 1 Kilometers just Cycling 1 Kilometers But its SOW Cycling 3 Kilometers Pls Fix This If Possible
Can't get ECG on the app and it's the whole reason I bought the watch.. UPDATE: so the ECG is its own app.. for some reason it wouldn't pop up when I put it in the play store search bar.. finally found it
I don't understand what happened to this app It doubles the amount of my steps For example My husband and I walk the same distance he is showing 3000 and I'm at 6000 Please fix it It started after your update I contacted Samsung but it is still not fixed
Previously 5 stars. Samsung decided to drop the heart rate sensor on their new phones in order to sell their watches. I don't wear watches so now the app is barely useful.
"I have used this app for years and it worked great, bought new phone, the updated app is worthless. I cannot get in, deleted and reinstalled and still cannot get in."
"Doesn't track well, and can't get the correct time to sync. I worked out at 7 pm it was recorded as 1 am. Woke up with 4k steps."
"I have this application for several years but just today, It was deleted and after another downloaded everything went hanky panky and all I tried to restore did not work. Please help me restore."
If you are crossing lake Pontchartrain causeway (new Orleans) at 65 to 70 miles per hour in passenger seat Samsung watch 4 will consider you are walking and start counting steps may be because of joints of the concrete bridge and counts for around 1/2 hour. This has happened 3 to 4 times. This needs to be fixed.
The app doesn't map my walks anymore and I'm not sure why. My location is on and it used to map. Everything else works great though.
"Complete waste of space, doesn't sync, works maybe 50% of the time. I'm binning my watch and going to apple. Lesson learned."
"Ever since the update, it will not go past the 2 step verification process. I can no longer use the app even after uninstalling and reinstalling."
"so annoying to see all the cheaters claiming they are walking up to 65 miles a day in the montly challenges. All these online forms talk about this and how samsung makes it difficult to report the cheaters by asking users to send in screen shots and then not even doing any about it yet the rules of each challenge say cheating isnt tolerated. No wonder why there are so many cheaters. Also as developed as samsung is why not have a report button in the app, I'm sure you can build AI for this"
I just bought a Watch5 and to my surprise the ECG and Blood Pressure is not working for x reasons.. why would samsung advertise new features of a brand new watch and to find it not working only after buying....... what are you looking to do??? Do you want your customers to go back to Apple????? I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS ISSUE
Useless. Doesn't work without a registering a Samsung account and I cannot open a Samsung account with a Falkland Islands phone number even though it is in the country list! I do know what my own phone number is ffs!!!
"Freezes most of the time and step count lags and doesn't register steps specially close to 12 AM, it just stops counting altogether."
"Don't buy a samsung watch and phone thinking you'll be able to check your blood pressure. The app is not available, yet. Samsung suggested I call the support number. I did and they confirmed the BP app is not available."
It keeps giving me errors and the app dosent opens I have tried a lot but every time it gives me error : SERVER ERROR OCCURED. don't know how to solve this.
With all the technology available this app still can't figure out that I'm not walking at 70mph. Why is it still counting steps when I'm driving down the highway.
Was perfectly happy with the app until I updated it this morning. I can't open it now due to server error (0x2C#1#). I have a Samsung Health app on my other device that looks different? I'm confused...
Struggle with app. Keeps saying cant open and to retry or log the error. I log a error and get no feedback and still cannot open and use app. Not helpful at all.
No sim card detected right after installing. Let's omit the fact that the health application should not care about the presence of a SIM card. But there is a SIM card in the phone
"Samsung's decision to disallow input from any garmin device renders this app useless for me. Samsung phones have also dropped Ant+, which all means bye bye Samsung phones and apps."
App is not supporting ECG and BP monitoring whereas Samsung Galaxy watch 5 has these features. Samsung must do something regarding this. This watch as costly as Apple watches whereas not supporting these features. This injustice with galaxy watch5 buyers. Very unhappy with this. Thanks
Can not sync step data with any other app. I have to manually put step data in each day. Get it together Samsung!
"Lost my sync with my Gear Fit, won't let me sync anything. Was working before last update in May, now will not work and will not let me install update that I am asked to install. What do I do now? Nobody responds to my review and I have no other way to communicate.."
After updated a few times and getting worse!! Why it always not on? Even I turn on everyday and it's still shut down?? I have to reopen eveyday and everytime I need to use!!
"Not working Stopped working 23/12/22 followed instructions to clear cache and data, restarted phone, uninstalled tried to reinstall app. Still won't load."
Work well but missing accumulated climb data. Really *Samsung*? how is this possible? It also does NOT support GPX exporting via Mountain Biking activity. Strange!
"Something has ruined this app. I just recorded a cycling exercise and unlike in previous recordings there now is no map showing my route, no graph showing the heart rates, speed and altitude at each time during the exercise, no average speed recorded, no max speed recorded, some errors in the heart rates. So disappointed. Was good until now, pretty useless"
I like the dark design for that it gets 5 stars...I know that a lot of features dont really work. Treat this as a fitness logbook and nothing more...
Very disappointed got a galaxy watch 5 to be able to use the blood pressure program only to find out that my Note 20 isn't a new enough phone to able to use it even though I was able to use the ekg before trying to reinstall
Basic health app but it serves the purpose for tracking. The update in 2 removed the Favorite Food List. You can mark it but where is the list??
This is a great app to view and see how many steps have been put through out the day..This app also helps with how much walking has been performed..
"Times no longer seem accurate! The individual km times run don't add up to the the Workout Duration (not referring to Total Duration). They are out by around 10-20s even on a 5k run! They used to always add up, which is what you'd expect. So don't know what my actual 5k time is! ******** Find it fairly useful and accurate... however, have to uninstall and reinstall every other week as for some reason the audio guide stops working... so get no indication of how much I've run."
"Good app however there are a couple of things to do that can improve it further. What is missing from weekly summary is how many minutes of vigorous and non vigorous exercise a person has done! All the data is there, so this is a very strange omission, since it would help a lot of people to reach the recommended 75 and 150 minutes respectively. Second omission is the ability to export all the exercise data (already present in the app) to say a spreadsheet format, so one can make comparisons..."
"EDIT: it used to be good, SECURITY WARNING!! It wants information on phone logs and contacts!! Like others have said don't give!! Samsung don't lie to me. You didn't need my phone before u don't need it now for ""improvements"". Who the hell even uses Together feature Old review: Counts your steps, shows exact time of exercise when walking or running and this is only just a tiny part of the app. It can measure ur stress and heartbeat (with Samsung phones only), provides calorie and so much more..."
"Almost the auto sync is not working. Even manual sync it won't work. Every time I need to open the Wear App to sync the data from watch to App. And another weird thing is that I am not able to see my weekly summary. Cumulative data. How did I do in a week? Trend just gives the information about average stats. Earlier we used to get weekly summary reports. ___added the following on 27th June... Contacted the help desk, but no luck. Looks like this issue is for all users. Pls fix this bug..."
"Excellent app, allows me to keep track of my health requirements, calories and exercise. Update 11/07/2020: They have changed the app. Many of the function are no longer available, and some will ONLY take input from massively expensive wearables, and only those made by Samsung. There are no longer manual input for stress tracker and pulse measurements. ** Update ** 26/02/21 - Recent changes to the program has removed more functions and the weight tracker is completely f**ked up. Used to be good."
"This app has been fun to use, and it helps me stay on top of my fitness goals. One thing I wish it had were some alternative ""exercises."" For example, most days I spend enough time tidying the house that it would be worth adding to my activities. Maybe add a custom category, so those every-day tasks can be added to the routine? Otherwise I love all the features, the workouts are great!"
This was my favourite app - used it every day for over a year. Sadly the latest update has totally destroyed it. The latest update has replaced a simple easy to use interface with something complicated that doesn't make sense. The best thing about this app was the calorie counter which summarised total calories burned (inc exercise) vs consumed and gave you a figure reflective of your daily goal for the current day and prev days. Please please roll it back to the previous version. Real shame.
"Well.. things have changed again. Until yesterday, I could see the time I spent running and the time I spent walking on the activity tab. Now it's gone. I don't understand the goal behind always changing things. I am disappointed... Below is my former review... It is still a good app, but the new updates have made it less ""good"". I would love to see the ""weight management "" feature back for example while keeping the new features."
"confusing interface and bugs. I bought the Samsung Galaxy fit 2 and connected it to the app. 1) you can't adjust the length of your step. Hence in my case for example it lowers the speed and distance by 20%, which is unusable. 2) there was a coffee cups counter widget. After I connected the band, it disappeared. 3) poor connectivity with Strava. I did 2 walks. I recorded one manually and another one automatically. The app merged them into one and send to Strava with errors."
Hate the new update. Not only is weight info removed but so has the quick view for activity stats. There is no longer any easy way to view graphs in any meaningful form. I have used this app since I started exercising 3 years ago to chart my progress so removing it and passing on a Galaxy Watch are a big deal but these recent changes are too many steps backwards for me.
"Loved the app until recently. The last update I received won't let me use the app until I agree to let it, ""make and manage phone calls"". Absolutely not!! The way I use the app, I can't imagine any reason why it would need to make and manage calls. Reply to Samsung Response: Your answer is not helpful and does not address my concerns. I can't imagine any reasonable features that would require making and managing phone calls to optimize my experience."
"I have used this app on all my previous Samsung phones and really loved it. I am so frustrated having upgraded to an S10 5G, transfered all my data using smart switch and everything works except Samsung Health. Have sought tech support and they were not able to help either. I have tried every possible setting change I can think of. What am I missing? I'm just reading, similar issues after the latest update During data transfer I was also prompted to install the latest update."
"Samsung App seems fairly accurate and easy to use. Sensitivity to recognise movements is pretty good. However, two aspects are Poor: 1) Old version let you input data for workout done manually for updating, present version ask you to start the activity and close the activity, but not record some activity you did by keeping the phone away. 2) In this age of Cloud based data sync, Samsung app does not update your old data if phone changes even of SIM is same...very strange and big weakness"
"At first I was enjoying the app along with the new Galaxy Fit e. Everything worked fine until my Fit e could not sync with the app every other day since last week. I am a very active person and likes to keep track of my activity. But how can I do that if this error keeps happening? Tried restarting my fit e and my phone in hopes that both devices will sync after the process. Still, effort and hopes gone to waste. Tried reseting and it deleted my record on my fit e. It's just frustrating!"
"Simplistic and missing a PC/web page component. It's kinda okay, but I just changed from a garmin watch to the Samsung and the Garmin Connect app was just so much better thought out. Samsung: 1. Go and think through how people actually train and make the app more complex. More options. More user-customizable. Feel free to contact me if you want a list of features to add. 2. Go look at your competitors like Garmin Connect and copy all their features! 3. Add a webpage component where I have more features and more control on a big screen. The watch is great. The app lets it down."
"Not sure why people don't like the new update, it's great. Looks clean and simple, it's easy to use and it's not to hard to scroll thru or press a button instead of swipe left and right. Overall it's a fantastic app that works well. Never had a problem and it's definitely helping me loose weight and motivates me to train more regularly."
"As a reminder to stay active and counting steps this app has been great for me. Definitely some room for improvement, I'd like to be able to track what I eat to make sure I'm eating enough and eating healthy rather than just the calorie intake. However the community section with the monthly challenges are quite fun and a great way to stay motivated"
"Just moved from iPhone to Samsung, discovered this app and love it as it's got everything in one place. One huge downer and that's why I'm giving only 3 stars is that I've got Amazfit smart watch and not only it doesn't connect to it, it doesn't even sync with it's app. So now I'm back to using various other apps instead of this one unless I figure out how to fix this problem. It's a huge disappointment and very Apple-y to not connect with other devices."
I've been using this app for a few years now and it's worked with no problems until a couple of days ago. The sleep records aren't displaying in the app. I wear an Active 2 watch and between the phone and the watch they sync and show all my sleep data. Not any more!! I have tried different ways to resolve this but with no joy. I use Samsung Health mainly for sleep and workouts so this is very frustrating. When it's all working this would definitely be worthy of 5 * but right now only 3!
"Not a fan of the new version (I notice there are many apologies for this). I have a fit smart watch (not a Samsung device) that I have been using for over a year now with the app and had no issues at all. Suddenly with this new version, the app no longer acknowledges my watch. Does this mean that the new version only supports certain devices as accessories?"
"Sadly the latest update has changed my opinion of this app drastically. The format has been changed for the worse, and the ability to check Trends (or Trends by category, for example heart rate after exercising) has gone. The app still records the data, but doesn't display it nearly as usefully as before. Very poor. They've turned a serious tool into a Fisher Price child's toy, and it sucks."
"Just a buggy unpolished experience that I wouldn't expect from what is regarded as ""the android phone company"". They remove important features with every update it seems. I always get warnings that the app keeps crashing and using a lot of battery. I've been a loyal Samsung customer for years but there are some things we cant let them get away with. It's a health app that no longer shows how many calories you burned. Enough said."
"Very good app overall, I didn't rate it 5 stars cause of the car (steps still counting even in a car) bug. I know it's kinda hard to differentiate between those and real steps, I'm a programmer myself, but I think it would help that instead of adding the steps and workout info automatically, you should prompt the user at the end of each ""workout"" whether that was an actual workout or just a ride in a car. Something like ""Did you just work out?""."
"It keeps crashing after the last update! Not only did they removed the weight management feature, which was the only one that actually used data to give us useful information, but they have also crashed the app for me. It's kinda useless now and I have a $300 watch with a screen I can't even use well now. Unacceptable!"
"The app doesn't work anymore. I keep updating it, but it won't fully update information from my watch to the app. For example, yesterday I went for a bike ride and the watch showed all of my details, but there is no record of the ride in my app. I used to use this feature of total work out time to track how active I was in a week. Now it's hit or miss if any of my work outs end up logged on my app. Disappointing - please fix this bug ASAP. I'm finding the watch less useful now."
"I've been using it for years and loved it for tracking my activities. Unfortunately I can't access my history after the latest updates, I can't even open the app unless I give access to contacts and phone. That makes absolutely no sense and the bull that the app needs that to make a better experience doesn't fly with me. I will uninstall and use something that doesn't have such ridiculous requirements."
"Previously 5 stars, but the handling of this app has me waiting for my contract to finish in September, so I can get my first non Samsung phone for over 20 years, and flog my galaxy fit watch. Weight management was by far the best feature of this app. It was easy, efficient, versatile, and by far the most important, effective. What do Samsung do? Leave the water tracking (because no one can possibly count to 7/8 during the day), and remove weight management. Own goal Samsung. Roll on Sep."
"This app can't sync anymore with my fitness pal which I've used for a long time to lose weight (successfully). Samsung is going towards a very disappointing path, disabling a lot of features which have been really good so far (e.i. mirrorlink). In addition this is the only app for weight and nutrition management not allowing you to scan foods bar codes. Honestly I won't be buying anymore samsung phones or other products."
"I have been using this app for over 3 years. Everything Samsung...t.v, phone... Since the last update, the app started to stall and fail. It's gone from being super fantastic to super shabby, fails to start, then starts, pauses, doesn't record, will not ""finish""..... Then the next day didn't record at all !! So unfortunately for now I am uninstalling and looking for something new..."
The update didn't seem to work. Doesn't record cycling stats or map. Step count doesn't appear accurate at all. Update - thanks to Samsung for getting back to me. Their advice worked so back to 5 stars. One small additional tip - if you like to use BBC Sounds while the Samsung app is running you need to allow background activity or the apps seem to stop each other. Had me puzzled for a while after the update but all working now.
Hi as of today's update to security policy I am no longer able to open the app. It goes around in a vicious circle after reading and accepting certain permissions. I am denying access to certain things such as for the app to change and manage my phone calls. I don't understand why that would be needed? It keeps taking me back to change settings. I have tried allowing everything but still does same. Have reinstalled to no avail... have been using this app for years with no issue before.
"Its good, but why have you discontinued the programs feature. Seriously, you are losing on what people want. The product owners need to be aware of the customer's expectations and needs. In the times like these health programs was a widely used feature. Edit: The feature is back. Kudos and Thanks! Updating the rating."
"Okay, but I have found that when using it for cycling, it suddenly freezes and does not measure the distance being travelled, I have to stop and reset the app, to get it going again. Also it would be better if it measured the distance travelled beyond your target distance. For example, when you start the app for cyclling you are asked to put in your target distance, lets suppose you put in 12km, it counts down from 12km , goes to zero then stops. It would be nice if it continued messuring beyond 12km."
"All of a sudden Spo2 measurement tool vanished, without any comment. I select this Samsung model specifically for that function, at an higher price compared to others. NB I am not in the USA. By suppressing this function without notice, Samsung shows (again) disrespect for its customers. Otherwise the app's functions are not easily accessible, and their setting hard to find. Later, I found the function under the heading Stress which is an impertinent renaming, except if it is what Samsung wants."
"I really like this app I just wish that I could send longer ""nudge messages"" during challenges. I would also like to see the ability have more than 10 challenges at once I and perhaps being able to choose challenge participants by geographic area. for example if I could say search for people in British Columbia or North America. This app hs greatly encouraged me to get exercise and has helped tremendous amount. I never expected to have this much interest and desire to walk keep up the good work!"
"So I'm not sure if others are experiencing this as well but for the last couple of days this hasn't been recording my steps at all and I'm getting quite annoyed by it. I have another app that also has a pedometer on it but it was good to have both picking up steps as they weren't always in sync and so I could work out an average from them both. But as I said, this is now not happening and its frustrating as this is what I mostly use this app for..."
"This app is really starting to get on my nerves, every time I open it trying to look at all the extra data I can't look at on my watch it constantly closes without me touching any buttons, I have to do this multiple times, some times a few minutes before the app doesn't crash and let me use it. I just want to be able to open it straight away"
"This latest update is the worst. It makes you agree to give ALL permissions before it let's you login. When you do, you still can't login because it wants you to setup the two step login. When you try to do it, it says login session expire, please login again. Every time I restart app, I get this same message. The only way to fix it, was reinstall the app, which meant losing this month's data because i hadn't sync recently. This is the second time i lose data. I had it with this lousy app."
Since the update I get a message 'can't set up the app'and 'log in to your Samsung account'. I do this and it makes no difference. All permissions are granted so I don't know why it no longer works. Having spoken to Samsung I'm being told that it's not compatible with my Motorola G8 Power phone even though it worked prior to the update ! Guess I'll have to start using an alternative app.
"I uninstalled the app when they removed the oxygen saturation tracking. It's not the only feature that has been removed. It appears as if Samsung wants to encourage you to buy the Galaxy watch... not happening.  The reply is useless for Canadian users because the stress function isn't available to us. Also, the only stress I'm feeling is with apps that remove functions without notice. I won't be reinstalling this app."
Used this app on my galaxy s10 to track spo2 level every day. Now on my new s22 app has gone backwards by taking that ability away. New is not always better.
"Totally awesome app! Started using it a few months back when I got sober and into fitness for the first time in my 31 years. Able to track everything I do and if required enter the raw data myself. Fun little challenges with friends across the globe, programs that are very useful and handy to have at your beck and call. Worth an install!"
"It's disappointing that when I open the app, it just starts loading showing the spinner and it never ends! it's 10 hours I'm searching on the internet and I see some people resolved the issue by installing the older versions which give you the ""skip"" option in the first page. I even installing that and even the skip button doesn't stop loading! I seriously don't know what to do! My phone is Galaxy J4"
"It was a great app, I don't know why it updated and now it stopped tracking my steps, it only works if the app is open. For example, I went for an 8 mile jog with my phone, I was listening to music, when I got home, I checked on my steps, I had 0 steps counted. From that moment on, I realized it was just working with the app on. It happened from Saturday September 29th on"
Phone doesn't always sync properly. My watch records X steps and the phone does not have the same reading after syncing on some occasions. Phone always disconnects with phone. If you don't own a Samsung phone DONT BUY A SAMSUNG watch. The most frustrating experience you will have. I have had both Samsung and non Samsung phones and there is a huge difference. Samsung and Apple have the same mentality. Need to have all their products to work properly.
"Last update now requires a lot of permissions to be granted (which i'm not prepared to do). No idea why it needs so much access to so much stuff on my phone. Sorry, finally uninstalled this and using one with more privacy. Also, used to be great but after various updates now you can't even view a count of your targets reached, maximum distance walkec etc. not as much fun as it used to be with less information and still no zoom on the graphs to see how far you have walked at any point in the day."
"Having issues! Since the latest update, the app is convinced that I'm 20 years younger than I am, so all the heart rate details are massively wrong. I've tried syncing repeatedly, changing my birthdate and saving, changing it back and saving again, but nothing seems to work. The dob is correct on my profile, but the stats are showing targets for someone 20 years younger. Really frustrating!"
Used to be good before the update. Everything kinda fails apart. The sync to runkeeper is gone. Everything else needs developer mode turn on. There's no 1 view without having to scroll down the page. And honestly buttons became smaller than before. What's up guys? Why try to make things looks hip but it just don't work better or worse.. worse....
"Overall it's great on my S8 to measure my heart rate and track steps or sleep, but the constant changing of the interface is really starting to get annoying! New update removed ads, so +1‚òÜ! But it changed the Steps widget, the green percentage bar is so awful! As I have the widget at full transparency, I'm able to see my wallpaper, but this new bar doesn't support transparency! Great that the devs are adding features, but don't force it! Would love to see an option to hide the percentage bar"
"The weight tracker has been removed! I have switched to an older version of the app until the weight tracker is replaced. It was for me the most useful part of the app. For anyone else missing it - uninstall the current version, turn off auto-uodates and then find and download the apk for version 6.10.5.031 Its a shame, I liked the return of the spo2 monitor but the weight tracker was so much more useful. Please put it back!"
This Update is the absolute worst!!! Food logging being the worst!! All snacks are now in one!! Now you have to manually calculate your snack calorie intake. Why change something that was perfect! Overall terrible and will eventually have to find a better app to use if you dont revert back. Layout is also horrible and info is missing!!
"Great app for keeping personal stats. The 'challenges' are completely useless. If you join a monthly challenge, it shows people that are getting in 200,000 steps per day. That is absolutely impossible, they are obviously cheating and the challenges are meaningless. The personal stats are good though."
Update: still the same not tracking distance properly even after suggestion by the technical team. Got a fast response from Samsung regarding my issue though which was impressive. Hope this issue will be resolved soon. Suddenly it isn't tracking my walking distance. After auto pause doesn't auto resume anymore. Keeps pausing even when I'm actually continuously walking and takes a while to resume or doesn't resume at all. Doesn't track my distance well with auto pause off too
Doesnt do what it's supposed to. It's apparently synced to my Samsung active watch but for whatever reason it says a different count of steps to what my watch says. And YES I do have it set to both watch and phone monitoring. It's been like this for months now and recent attempts to try and fix the issue resulted in losing 2 years worth of data.
"Poor after the recent update. The app seems to have removed the ability to select or create different workouts (e.g., cardio or fat burn). These were great for creating my runs as they used the coach option to update on pacing etc. Now you can only set a distance, time, or calorie target for runs and there is no coaching. Will probably now look for an alternative app for my workouts."
"Please please please make editing workouts possible. It's so frustrating when you just make a little mistake when entering some data and you have to delete it and start again. And make it possible to just enter total distance swum in a pool rather than lengths of set distances, since some pools aren't standard. Also when entering mountain biking data rather than recording it on the go please make it possible to add a distance so it's not '1.5 hours, 0km', that's just bizarre."
"I think this app is good for logging steps/workouts. The downside though is that it is really not easy to add people as friends. Even if you send invites, if your recipient clicks on the link you send them it doesn't automatically add you as their friend on the app and to add someone you either need to know their email address or be with them to scan a qr code. Would also be really great if the app could sync with information gathered through other popular apps such as myfitnesspal."
New format does not show calories burned and exercise log is rubbish basically an unreadable list. There is no way to set a target for number of training sessions per week. Limited customisation and using small light fonts on a white backgroung is a terrible idea.Fitbit app is simpler and much much better. Samsung needs to fix this truly awful interface and add basic fitness functions. What is completely bizarre is that the galaxy watch app is much better. In spite of the minuscule screen the watch provides a much better experience. But the companion app is a massive fail
"Love this app but not recent changes. I no longer have access to see my over/under for caloric intake and I enjoyed using that feature of the app. I also like the way the heart rate in recent workouts looked better before the changes. More colorful and esthetically pleasing. It seperated the days instead of by week, which I preferred. It seems to be taking longer to update new info with my watch as well."
Thanks for messing up this app again. The sleep data from my Gear S smart watch was fine after you finally fixed it several months ago. Now you've done yet another update and messed it up again. Oh and no I don't want a pointless international phone number to call. Or idle promises. I'd just like to see it fixed or rolled back to the previous version. Stop messing things up and leave it alone...
"Sometimes the app updates improve features, other times they don't. The most recent update is the latter. Now there's no way that I can find in the app that will give me a weekly or monthly average weight like there was previously. The same goes for calories to an extent; I can get a 7 or 31 day average (but it only appears to be a rolling average) however the macros only come up as useless percentages and not totals i.e. 20% protein instead of a much more useful 180g protein."
"When I open my running maps on Samsung Health and on other apps, I notice that SHealth's hasn't precision, it is very clumsy. Also, I miss more data's summary. I can only see a list of my runnings by day, week or month, and the visualization is not practical. I miss something more graphic and embracing, so I can really see my improvements."
"Doesn't track the activity properly. In case while walking of you happen to stop abruptly due to a sudden obstacle, there is a break in activity. If you're on a call and walk, it doesn't count it as an activity. The step count does increase, but they have a feature wherein of you do any exercise for a prolonged period, it counts it as an activity. There are flaws though in this. It also doesn't show the total distance walked in a month as a summary which most pedometer apps do."
"Really like this app. It's great the way you can set friends on it which keeps you motivated. I love the stats it records after a workout, because I use my Samsung Watch it give me my heat rate aswell. I do however have one big problem with it, it only records 30 days activity. This is soooooo annoying as I want to keep track of my personal best 5k, 10k, etc runs. I would give it a 5 star rating if it stored all my runs, I have to take my phone with me and I also use mapmyrun app on the phone."
"I used to love this app and got many friends and family on board using it too. Unfortunately the calorie tracking widget, along was other features, was recently removed. I, and fellow users are most disappointed about this. It was a fantastic feature which really helped with weight loss, the at a glance graphic to see calories eaten, burnt and remaining was not only useful but very motivational too. I am now trying to find a suitable replacement. Very Sad samsung, very sad!"
"It's a pity, but it's not working. Clock's hardware works excellent, GPS is enabled. Everything is fine with cycling, running with all GPS metrics in water, but in swimming (outdoor) mode speed, distance aren't working. As I said before in my previous message, I did a hard reset, but except of this, I did a cleaning cache, stopped and started again pedometer, but it didn't work. GPS metrics aren't working in swimming (outdoor) mode on my GW4 Classic."
"No option to edit workout - if you forget to stop your workout recording on your device when you finish, there's no 'auto stop' so it'll just keep running indefinitely until you remember. There's no way to then go back and edit your session to the actual correct duration, leaving you with meaningless data. This has been brought up numerous times on Samsung message boards, but the company continue to ignore requests to add what would be a very simple feature."
Steps and miles ran are off by a mile with my Samsung Watch 4! GPS is all over the place when I go to the track. Switching to Garmin.
"I don't like the newest update. It is harder to follow. I liked the trends options especially for sleeping to track my patterns, but it is no longer available. The graph is there, but no longer shows the specific breakdown. Seems lots of things are missing in this update. Frustrating!"
"Since the recent update (a couple of days ago I think) I'm not able to swipe away notifications, whereas, before I could. I've tried various notification settings for the app but they still remain in the list. Maybe I'm doing something wrong, if not, please can we make notifications swipeable again. Thanks."
Please fix snore detection. It no longer detects any snore. Watch 3 Note 20 ultra.
"Can't get this to sync with Healthy Path, although Blue Cross says it's compatible."
There seems to be a problem to sync the details from watch. The details are not syncing into the mobile smoothly always lagging .Team please fix this ASAP.
Latest update seems to have resolved the list of issues. Edit: Samsung health permissions not working with Google Health Connect. Permissions are removed after a few minutes.
Since the last upgrade in which weight management was removed it has turned this once very good and useful app into something that is useless. It just takes space on your phone now. Weight Management was very good and has helped me to loss weight and maintain a healthy life style. Removing has made is useless and it's time for me to start looking for replacement. I can never understand why companies destroy something good and that works.
"Does not work for cycling. It is not recording your activity. So you report issue about it. After following the solution steps it still did not work. And for walking, it records even in a bus. It will keep you motivated with saying that you are above hundred percent ahead of the daily goal, however you have walked just a few hundred meters... As an experienced samsung user, I will not recommend this app. Luckily there are other alternative apps in market."
Wants to control your phone calls...wants my phone number! Total BS idea. It used to be a great app. Now its a waste of time data miner.
The app is lacking some features that only surface when you have a Samsung watch. If in Auto record mode it has no idea when you're cycling where you are yet it does when you are walking. It doesn't ask you are done exercising? before it automatically stops recording even if you're taking a momentary break. You can't combine mistakenly eneded exercise sessions & make them one. Vibrate the watch & phone before auto record stops. Change colour finish button to red so it's obvious. Landscape info!
earlier times I had c9 Pro. it was excellent experience with Samsung health. but now I'm having s21ultra. step counting sensitivity is poor.
There's no healthy pace for steps anymore. Just counting steps by themselves is pretty useless. I also don't want to share my contacts. I don't want to use together and share info with people I barely know. I also really don't want to use a watch! Getting a smartphone and no longer have to carry a watch was so liberating. Removing pulse and oxygen measurement from the phones was a huge downgrade. This app no longer serves me a purpose so I've uninstalled it.
"I use Samsung Health to keep track of my weight and blood pressure. When I got a new smartphone, I had to ask Samsung how to transfer all my data from the old phone to the new one. I had a response in less than 24 hours (on a weekend!) and had all my old data transferred within 30 minutes! Thanks Samsung. (I really should use the app for more, but I'm just too lazy.)"
"So far I love the update, new visual style is appealing for me. But the old trouble stays the same - no matter how productive you were for the first week or more - if you decide to participate in monthly competition, you will lost all your progress until the very day of your decision. I see the point like ""if you want to compete yourself with others you should check for the begining of the challenge"" but what can I done if I have a lot of things to think of and just forgeting this all the time"
"Lacks many features that thr base apps from Fitbit and Garmin have offered for years. Can't edit a workout after finishing, so too bad if you forgot to start or finish a workout at the right time. Cant easily graph progress of various stats over previous weeks, cant reteive weekly averages for a lot of key things you'd expect to track averages for, like calorie burn. Overall it's little more than a motivation simulator that pats you on the back at random intervals, rather than a serious tool."
Weight management was an essential part of the app. It told people how much food were they supposed to consume at that time in order to maintain balance/deficit of calories. I was shocked to see it disappear. I strongly recommend to bring it back. It is was the major reason I use this app instead of others and I'm using it since a year and a half on a REGULAR basis. Thanks
Used to be able to choose Walk or Run etc but now the Exercise feature has disappeared. Why Samsung?
"It's really good, but there are some features that need to be improved and fixed. Like the sleep detection in watch 4... it doesn't work if you take a nap or afternoon sleep. It'll show the night sleep only and after that if you sleep it's not considered. Also please add some more variations of gym workouts. Other than these minor changes, it's perfectly working and I like it!"
"While I like the overall look of the new update, and am having fun with my new Galaxy Watch, I'm finding a lot of my activities are getting doubled-up, and I cannot delete the extra workouts. For instance, today I've got a 31 min workout recorded on my Galaxy Watch, and a 31 min ""General"" workout imported from MapMyFitness. Only one is registering in the active time, but I can't delete the extra one, so it keeps popping up in MyFitnessPal and messing with my calorie count. In the old interface, I could easily delete workouts. Why would you remove that feature???"
The app stopped showing the cycling icon . I used it for last 3 years to track my cycling targets. Please help
Having to agree to the terms over and over again is very tedious and too time consuming for me.
Excellent app! There's everything you need on it to stay in shape.
Ibdont like that took your glucose level off. I fontbuse insulin ot was an easier way of keeping track for me
That give me best experience of walking but after updating it . App don't show any notification
My foot steps are not resetting at all. You should work on this. Thank you
Inaccurate... it counts steps while I'm not moving at all!
Needs improvements and it's too many updates and then it crashes
"It was working fine till last month. But now i couldn't able to open the app itself. Unauthorized changes were made to your phone error appear Everytime i open. I tried cleaning up data and reinstalled the app multiple times. No change. Same error appears. I see similar issues reported multiple people. Samsung team, please respond the same ASAP 9/11/2019: Based on the response, i could able to reinstall the app and resume my tracking. Thanks to the support team!"
From sometime It is counting steps even phone is sotting on one place and manual running is not good enough
"Can't check spo2, measurements for sitting down and movement are broken (will say I'm sitting down while walking), distance calculation is a bit off and so are steps."
"It was such a great app until the recent update (aug 2020). For me, the app worked great and I lost a lot of weight thanks to the app. However, they deleted the feature of weight management control and that really dissappoints me. If anyone out there saw this review and can add the weight management feature back in that will be so appreciated!!! The feature (weight management) helped me a lot in my fitness journey. :)"
Calorie Counter works but doesn't give right readings Also Bluetooth Heart monitor only works if its Samsung on my old S8 it worked fine
"This app has a lot of potential but has some annoying bugs, for example. The manual recording of sleep often wont save... means the auto estimate has been way over or under (7hrs +/-) and sometimes picks up sitting still as sleeping... Food recording: awkward for several reasons, due to word count The weight management function has 'calories over' coloured red. Red as in danger or very bad.... I have set the function to help me gain weight gradually over time so this irritates me a lot!!!"
Next to useless. I can walk 2 miles and it doesn't register anything. Then when I walk back it will show / record that ! I can exercise for an hour and it'll show 15 mins. It in no way whatsoever gives even a close representation of what exercise is being done. I only wish I could delete it from my phone but it's a Samsung app on a Samsung phone so it won't let you remove the app.
"It's a useful app really but can be even better. For example meditations are in English only and those with not enough English knowledge can not use it. One big problem is that, there is no where in the app to share what users experience. I wish I could share my ideas to improve the app through an email for instance. üôÅ"
"Edit: I'd like to add a phone number, but the process is not working. _____ App just stop working after update. It is asking 2-step verification, so I added phone number, it sent me text, put the code and clicked verify and it cleared the form and ask the same again. I tried it again and same results. Now when I try it, I can't pass the verification, because no sms is coming. So basically, I just lost all my fitness progress since I can't log into the app. Btw, I have Samsung phone! Never again!"
Updated my phone from my Note 9 and now your forced to buy one of their devices to check your heart rate. Never again will I buy this garbage again.
"Best app for samsung watch users, period tracker is very accurate üëå sleep tracking and sleep scoring is very good too"
Can't connect other devices that aren't Samsung. This is not worth having
Is good but despite several attempts I have been unsuccessful in getting a sauna feature in the exercise tracking options
Dumb thing adds over a thousand steps late at night at least twice when I was lying in my bed reading. And can't them out. SO INACCURATE
"I loved this app until the most recent update, which has changed the daily activity counter to include calories burned, with no option to switch the calorie count off. For those with eating disorders or disordered eating this is really dangerous - one of the things I loved most about this app vs others was the lack of forced calorie counting, but now I'll need to find an alternative unless it's changed"
"Best app for fitness.Detects,pauses and resumes workout automatically.i live it"
"Once I have changed phone, why you are sending the code on old phone which I do not posess any more."
"Overall, the app is good. I wish you were able to put the exact amount of water you drink."
"App required me to sign in again for 2 step authentication, which for personal fitness for me, is totally over the top. I should be able to choose whether to use it, regardless the app would not open so reinstalled. It's just lost all of my workout data, except the last month. All of it. Follow up: Your response doesn't help me at all."
"The app stopped working. I uninstalled it and when I re-installed it, all I get is a page that wants to me to agree to privacy but there's no way to do this--all I get is an option to download. Then it asks for settings. I get nothing. When I had it before it let me track time, various activities, HR, steps, water intake as well as challenges. Now I assume that exists somewhere but I can't get it to show up. All I get is app info which is totally useless."
This app was great when it worked. I relied on it and it did help with a healthier lifestyle. The last update messed up the app. I cannot even use it any longer because it can longer be opened with my phone. It gives an authentication error message. I called Samsung for help and they still could not fix it despite my remotely using smart tutor to assess the phone with my permission. Update: Samsung got in touch. Provided a dump file. App still not working
"Silent notification telling me Samsung Health is running to check my health. CAN YOU STOP CREATING REDUNDANT NOTIFICATIONS ABOUT AN APP BEING AN APP... ARE YOU DEVELOPERS FOLLOWERS OF ""WATER IS WET""???"
"I use this mainly at work to count my steps. I do the same job every day, some days it says over 6,000 steps most days it says 1500-3000. How can there be such a difference? Don't know if I have confidence in the accuracy? It would also be nice if it would stop asking about my cycle, I'm almost 60 haven't had one in over 10 yrs!!!"
If I remember to use it. Is there a way to connect with Fitbit versa 2?
"The previous version was flawless. There are two issues with the new update as far as I know 1. Weight management option is no longer there 2. Weekly summary for the last week is not updated since the new update arrived. Apart from that, it don't really see any other issues. Looks neat."
Can't see any bike ride been mapped since last two updates!!! This really sucks...
Not accurate at all from heartbeat to steps. Just a gimmick
Please make a daily activity widget and add more widgets. Great app
I have always liked this app until I realized it's not tracking my distance accurately.
"The new update is missing several features from the previous version that made it a 5 star app. I can appreciate the slick design of the new update but I would love it if a few items were put back: 1. The total daily macronutrient intake (in grams) 2. The option of morning, afternoon and evening snacks. 3. The ability for the app to automatically store a few of your previous meals. This is overall still a great app but I personally feel the previous version was better. I hope the feedback helps"
Runs really bad since the update this morning can't maintain its connection to my account
After the update the app no longer opens keep receiving server error
"Can't use it anymore without signing in, please remove sign-in or make it optional"
I am a regular user of this app with a bike trainer. Up until a recent update it was working fine. The app would detect the Garmin Sensors (speed and cadence) using ANT+. Now it cannot detect the sensors and you can only use bluetooth to connect to accessories. What is going on? Without the sensors you cannot calculate distance or calories burned.
Does not work anymore (specifically the step counter). Samsung S8
Just upgraded phone from S9 to A32 & found the stress tracker missing. A quick search says this may not be supported on all phones. A bit silly if a phone won't support features used by its own branded app. I've also read the comments about the permissions now required by the app. Continuing to provide a proforma response isn't really going to cut it with consumers.
"Pretty good but could be better. I recently got a G-Shock watch with a step counter function and was disappointed (although not surprised) that this app and my watch cannot be used together. Would be good if you could partner up with them so that this is possible, or else add a function that allows manual editing of steps. It would also be good if you were able to edit a workout after finishing it, as I once ended up 'doing' 10 hours of yoga..."
I've been continuously using the app for more than a month now. I would had given it a 4 star but the recent update ruined my experience. First of all the color choice they update is not for colorblind like me. There are no contrast in the colors to distinguish the percentage of the nutrient intake summary. Another thing I notice is that they'd remove the feature if I am over or under in my calories for the a time being. I which they had made it better but they just ruined the great experience.
Doesn't count steps accurately need to uninstall and reinstall again for it to work
"Samsung Health Devs: I've been using the app to track my weight for the past 2 years. I've recorded my weight regularly, so there's good quality data on my average weight changes over time. Today in Feb 2021, I would like to know how my current weight compares with my weight in Dec 2019. I cannot because you've changed the data visualizations that make this extremely difficult to do. I have no use for this app in its current state. Your Jan 26 update has been a major disappointment. Very poor."
So far so good. Would prefer if it was like my huawei app where it registered the type of sleep I'm getting not just the quantity.
From few days ...my watch after every workout it reset itself to zero...means no activity time and activity calorie while I had 7k steps
2 verification just a trash. The verification code never send to my phone
It would be nice if we can add friends from the leadweboard
"Would be much better with a running (sic) average UPDATE: (Previous score 3 stars) I have now just been blocked from using the App as Samsung apparently want access to my call records and the ability to ""make calls"" from my phone! Bizarre. I have uninstalled and strongly suggest you don't touch this with a barge pole. I had been using this App for over 2 years and so have lost 2 years of my fitness data. Samsung should learn the difference between data mining and data theft."
This app used to be fantastic. Now they have updated it. They have removed two meal slots which makes tracking far too complicated and changed the UI to something that is awful and barely understandable. Why they felt the need to change the calorie limit from an easy to read bar to a lemon that fills up is beyond me. This update has not only ensured that I will never used this app again but has made me reconsider even getting a Samsung phone for my next upgrade. Absolutely ludicrous.
"Loads of data missing, in the middle heart rate goes missing or the speed when you really wanted to see how you did in your workout. It is annoying. I clean watch at the back thinking there's something on it but it makes no difference. It does it again. Why? I've now read other people have same problem so I'm not alone. Wish I could trust it better"
"This app worked well until last update. Why mess around with a working app. It now tells me that I have stopped walking when I have not. (Auto pause). And does not restart. Today I walked nearly 12 miles. The app says that I walked less than a mile although it has logged my walk when I look at recent work out. The most annoying thing is it keeps saying that I have completed 0.9 of something? What? What apples, pears, breathing? This app worked well before it was updated."
"Overall, I find this a useful app. A couple of things which are a bit annoying though: Recording food: useful for calorie counting but information is lacking in other nutrients. Eg, semi-skimmed milk, peanuts and beans contain no calcium, according to this app! Makes it difficult to trust the figures on everything. Workouts: judging some exercises by time is appropriate. However, push ups, pull ups.....? Surely this would be better if the user inputs the number of reps they have completed?"
"The app is very useful and includes many features that help you monitor your health. Blood pressure, exercise times, sleep, sugar, coffee and etc. was very useful until started crashing from no apparent reason after the latest update. I use my sport device without a sim card. So what's up? it means I can't use the app anymore? A bit weird to demand that every user has a sim card in addition to user profile."
"Horrible update that made me uninstall the app and look for an alternative. The feature that I used the most was HR tracking due to heart issues, and the continuous option showing the graph and average heart rate helped me tons, but it has been suddenly removed. What am I supposed to do with the HR range? Even the hourly measurement shows only range, which is completely useless to me. It makes me sad since I have both galaxy S21 and galaxy watch. Won't be coming back until the feature returns."
"This app was good up until recently, I used it often and then all of a sudden it kept crashing when I was opening it every time so I can't even get on it. I think it may be something to do with this permission update but I think I'll be changing to another health app that doesn't require me to give all my phone permissions just to track my heart rate."
"Good app, the auto exercise needs to actually automatically start, I would say 50% of the time it does not record. Also cant get it to track my exercise route, havent been able to do this in over 8 months. tried resetting, uninstalling but still doesnt track location even though location tracking is on. (Samsung S9) EDIT: can you respond rather than me call, there are many users with the exact same issue when I search for answers on the internet forums."
"In the past this app ran fine on my Galaxy S7 and was a great fitness/weight-management aid. In recent months it has slowed down with each update and now runs at a snail's pace. Slow to launch, very slow to switch from one category/page to another, painfully slow to register keyboard inputs (such as when searching the food database). I cleared the app's cache, then the app ran at an acceptable speed... for 20 minutes! Now so slow, again, it's unuseable.  Samsung, do you have a freephone UK customer services, number, please?"
"With the previous version, I would have rated this app, 4/5 stars... unfortunately, I am very disappointed with the new update! I miss the old graphic so much were you could see the change month to month and week to week. Data is still there but it you have to keep scrolling over and back and it is built with multiple bars, rather than a bar per week or bar per day! Please please change it back :("
"I would like to give this 5 stars as its an amazing health app and even better than that apple version on there smart phone.  It syncs seemingly with my smart watch and the other health app on my phone.  I am able to monitor my food intake, heart rate, steps and how many miles I've hiked on my adventures.  But there is one feature missing that would make me give this amazing app a 5 star. And that you can't scan the bar-code using this app and have to put the food in manual by typing in what you've eaten and trying to find the right item in the list. It is for this reason alone that I'm using a 3rd party app like myfitnesspal to sync up all the calories data to my health app.  Its a feature that's a long time coming and would really make a huge different's to the app. By making it easier to add your food to the app."
"I used to love this app and it worked well. I could record my heart rate, stress levels and now it is all gone. It says in notification that it is no longer support Android OS 7, but mine is 11 and nothing in this app works except step counter. I am going to uninstall this as I have a better app now that does everything that I need. I hope you can fix this issue as it is shame that after so many years I have to uninstall it."
I just wish the pedometer would work well and I don't have to have SIM card to use this app. It is not needed because it even can not verify my identity. The low difficulty exercises seems harder for me (beginner and overweight). I hope they would find or able to sync with many other fitness app or provide easier exercises. Sorry for uninstalling.
The most usefull part about this app was the weight management feature. I came back to this app after a whole 3 months to go after my basic routine only to find out the feature was taken out in an update. Samsung please return the weight management feature. A lot of your customers look after it. Hoping to seeing this feature in a soon update. Been 2 months waiting for the weight management feature. Guess I'm moving on to some other app.
Rubbish app. Asks for to many permissions (make and receive phone calls? What's that about?) Also forces you into 2 step authentication whether you want to or not. The app itself is almost child like with difficult to find and understand the information. If you don't use it for a long time you are prompted to sign in again but trying that closes the app! Uninstalled.
"When it works it's great, I like the all together option with the challenges. Gave me something to aim for/sense of accomplishment when a goal reached.Unfortunately for the last two months it has stopped counting steps properly. Have tried pausing and restarting step counter but I am having to do this multiple times a week now."
"As a health tracking app it's pretty complete and I personally only really miss a glimpse at past values on the title cards without having to go through each one. Having said that, in true Samsung fashion, if ads can be crammed in it, we'll do it and we'll only play nice with 3rd party services that cater to us."
"I used to love this app and used it regularly. The recent update has crippled so many important features that made it a valuable health app. What annoys me the most out of the recent update is that the weekly summaries are now next to useless. They used to track your activity for the week and you could compare it to past weeks. It was really helpful for me to see how active I had been and be able to set goals but now it only tracks your sleep. Total bummer, think I'll go back to pen & paper"
Put back the weight management feature!! No notice and it was just gone.. along with all the data! Been using this app and loving it but you just took away the best feature that sets it apart from the rest! Surely you can see by a quick google search and your recent reviews that it wasnt a good choice! Disappointed!
I have been using the app a while and has helped massively with tracking food and exercise. It has helped me make a positive lifestyle change however I'm not happy that the weight calorie management feature has been removed. If that was still there it would be a 5 star app but it just seems like a stupid move to remove a good feature.
"Overall it's a good app but I'm missing line graphs one everything that has graph part and a page where I can see a graph of distance that I've walked. Also I'm missing ECG an Blood Pressure only because I have non Samsung phone, c'mon... Btw take some notes from Google's Fit app as I'm a bit lost in the layout of your app. Make your sleep chart similar to the one found in the mi fit app and add route map syncing from watch (can't find a map with route that I've taken in your app)."
"I have had no technical issues with this app and enjoy using it. Upgrades I would like to see soon would be the ability to set my own macros, and for it to allow for editing and deleting of ""my foods"". Sometimes I make a recipe and change an ingredient or two or I make a mistake and close before I finish putting the info in and cant change or delete it so I have 2 of the same things. I would like to be able to just go in and update the info instead of starting all over again."
"Very old not user friendly interface, wake up and get with the times, the app was last updated about 5 months ago. It's like their not bothered. Might have to move away from the galaxy watch, shame because its a lovely watch, this rubbish app lets it down. Edit: you need to add a calendar that shows all the days you reached your active mins/active calories/active hours targets, it would be great motivation to keep reaching targets."
"It was good before. Could see activities separately from mobile or watch , e.g. walking or running recorded by phone or watch. But now adding up mobile and watch. Very very disappointed . I have Galaxy s10+ and galaxy watch. It says you can't see the activities separatly from your watch. Not able to see the activities on my watch either because it syncs with mobile and adds up, you see the total which can be more than what you have done if it is not double. Very very disappointed."
"It was an excellent app, tracking everything I wanted. And then came last update. Now I can't enter the app any more. It requires two step verification and when I enter SMS code it loops to beginning of verification. Result is that I can't enter. Message for devs: I don't care if anyone sees how many steps I did. Just make the app work. Step counter widget still works, so I gave second star. Also, telling me to contact support from the app is hard if I can't enter the app"
"Sadly the app is deteriorating more and more each day. I used to recommend this app to everyone, now I'm looking for alternatives. The step counter does not count a single step without my watch. (it's not my phone, because my phone registers my steps on its own OS) The app no longer has weight management and no longer tracks coffee intake or how many stairs I climb. My watch no longer automatically connects to my phone and the battery life is terrible. I'm terribly disappointed."
"The watch and Samsung app were working quite well until an update where it seems to have messed everything up. My watch cannot sync sleep tracking data with my phone now, and if I try to sync the data using the app it asks me to record my sleep data manually. I don't know what Samsung did in a recent update, but my sleep tracking doesn't work at all now. Please can you fix this bug or error, I bought the watch to specifically track my sleep data."
"Like many other users I found weight management to be the best feature of the app. It is truly disappointing that this feature got removed instead of improved. Ever since the update I find myself not actually using the watch like I used to, I think it is incredibly annoying that I would require to calculate my calories Vs burnt ones instead of just a quick glance at the weight management data! I am seriously considering to choose another brand watch, which is a shame, I really liked Samsung!"
"App does not show steps walked and stairs climbed separately (like it does in apple iphone app). Also in steps counter bar chart, it would be very convenient if steps count & kilometers can be displayed above or in the bar itself. Sorry to say but I think I could not convey my point properly. What i mean to say is that there is no staircase climbed counts seperately. Didn't see any option as 'All steps' or 'floors' in any menu of the app. Please provide your email id to communicate further."
"Samsung App seems to deteriorate with time Recently, the ability to see when stepcount is paused has disappeared. How does one upload to Discovery Vitality. There used to be a button on Discovery app to sync data, but this has also just disappeared. I tried to unlink and link in the hope that this might fix things. Unlink was successful, but link didn't work due to failure of Samsung site to respond. Rather frustrating. Please help with concrete advice."
"I used to rate 5 stars, and use the app 24hrs a day. But no longer use the app at all due to the removal of weight management on last update. At least I found out right before I bought the latest gear watch. Phew No need for that if I have no more need for the app without weight management. Its been a few weeks now and I don't miss it like I thought I would. I'd come back if this feature is returned shortly. But if its weeks or months away I'll move on. It was fun for a few years anyway"
"I can't even login. Once I entered my credentials, there is this endless spinner and nothing else. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app, it makes no difference. Edit: ok I figured out how to login on the app. You gotta skip the login process in the first place to access the app itself. Then you can login ""normally"", that's quite an annoying bug hope it'll be fixed soon. The app itself is good, just missing some finishing touches IMO."
Well I've now given up. Bought my watch originally for cycling but now want to train for ironman style events. Never syncs with strava so had to buy a wahoo bike computer and now looks like I need a new watch for swimming and running. What a waste of money this was. I wouldn't mind exporting the gpx file but there is no longer the button to export it. It seems to get worse every update. So much for technology moving forward.
"Using this with the new Galaxy watch, which has a useless heart rate monitor. On the surface it looks useful until you start trying to dig down to get useful data. You can make it monitor your heart rate continuously but apart from inside some exercise apps you can't see anything other than today's hi and low rates. Cycling app, great shows a reasonable amount of data, heart rate speed, elevation, times over predefined distance. However looking for long-term data, nothing you get the last 30 days. It feels very superficial and is totally unsuitable for any serious tracking of fitness"
Not as helpful as expected! I have tried turning the sleep management option off as I don't need it but it still pops up with messages about how long I have been asleep. I turn my phone to flight mode overnight so the timings aren't correct anyway! One night it had my asleep from 21.40 yet I had gone upstairs to get ready for bed at 22.30 and walked around after that and the steps were also recorded! Doesn't record pottering about the house on the Fit but does on phone.
This app is quite good. I prefer the older UI but.the new one works on too. BUT my biggest issue with this app (old and new) is you can't edit the distance for walking or running. Specially for treadmill running. Maybe have an option for treadmill & allow the distance to be entered manually. Pleeeeeeease. That is my biggest complaint.
Lots of food missing. I think it's locked in Samsung only phones. How unfortunate.
"Good for the challenges but suspect some of the top 10 ones are fake, unless some people walk over 50 km a day every day. Regardless, personal challenges between friends are fun. It would be nice if the language was stable, though, as half my feed is Spanish and half English, despite having set preferences to English. App is bit flaky synching with a Fite band, and seems to rely on a second app ""Galaxy Wearable"" as a thunking layer for some reason. Big shame it won't synch with Runkeeper though."
The calorie/weight management feature uses an odd formula to track your daily intake with a gauge. This makes it super confusing to know how you are doing. Also they lock in calorie targets so setting your own is impossible. Not an easy to use app once you get into the nitty gritty. Go elsewhere if you are seriously wanting to track.
"I don't know what happened with the new update but I think it is corrupt. My phone crashed and couldn't turn on with the power button alone. This was due to this app crashing repeatedly and even with clearing data and force stop it continued to crash until my phone turn off. Please fix this problem. Until then, I removed the app from my phone."
"The app has essentially become useless for me since the last update. I have been using it for years for activity tracking and weight management. Samsung decided to take the weight management feature away for no good reason as far as I can tell, leaving its users with an app that doesn't have the basic functionality like its competitors (Apple, Garmin, Fitbit). Good luck getting people to buy your new Galaxy Watch."
"Only recently started using the app, as I got a samsung active watch. Really disappointed. Even with GPS on and linked to my strava account only some runs/walks sync (all permissions are active) and the distances and times are completely different. Also meant to be able to synch to my fitnesspal to keep Track of steps but doesn't, tried re installing, re setting permissions but it will not sync. Auto workout is set on my watch but not recording on the health app, even after I manually sync."
"Happy to have all the info in one place. Very useful together with samsung watch! I would appreciate a small improvement in active time view thought, I'd like to see all my exercises when choosing month or week view and averages together (not just average) Edit: I've dealt with previous sync issues by updating comment fields for missing exercises and now everything is good."
Get volkano watch access not all of us can afford fancy watches. I like this app don't make me download other apps just to track my fitness
"Very poor experience. Drains my battery. Doesn't sync reliably. The watch itself is ok.. But when the strap broke due to a defect Samsung refused to honour the warranty despite their own service centre approving the claim. Not happy. Edit 28 June. Syncing is worse. No weekly history since November 2019. Cannot sign in reliably. 3rd party apps do not sync despite enabling all permissions. Battery drain is horrible. App crashes during runs and rides... Basically makes it useless. Latest update...wish I could give the app zero stars. Keeps logging me out, won't sync properly with Strava or other apps. They dropped the link to LF Connect (Life Fitness) and now apparently they are removing weight, food and caffeine tracking. I think the software engineers at Samsung are the laziest in the industry. Rather than add features, they remove them. Did the same thing with the watch itself and our ""smart TV""."
"For many years that I've been using this app I have realised that it has lost quality. The GPS tracking using my Watch 4 while exercising is weak [imprecise plotting] compared to STRAVA that creates a much more precise and straight line. When sharing data with other apps [STRAVA & Goole Fit] there are differences on the figures shared I.e. distances, timings and calories... We've lost the instant Oximeter... so, no more instant measuring... among other small changes."
"Was fine before the last update, barely records a sleep properly now & going for a walk sometimes doesn't record the route...I've actually stopped looking at the data. If it ain't broke don't fix it, when will you app builders learn to stop messing around. You get used to the layout and the colour and how to find things and somebody feels the need.to justify their job with an 'update and then everybody gives it 1 STAR."
"Love using Samsung health, good GPS on Samsung Watch original and have no problems. Be nice to see what my foot striking was like lef/right ratio perhaps otherwise good."
"Used to be a great app for monitoring movement and exercise trends over time, but this feature has disappeared. Can no longer easily track active minutes by day, week, month whether in total or by exercise category. Not being able to easily access my historical data and compare it to current activity, significantly reduces the usefulness of the app for me. Hope this feature can be restored."
"Been using it for months. Works pretty fine, but on my M31 the already posted ""sleep time"" data for the last 2-3 days sometimes just disappears and has to be refed. Yesterday the App suddenly stopped recording the steps walked and no amount of walking or shaking helped. There is no help option in the app. Uninstall & reinstall also failed to reactivate the app stuck at a particular number of steps. Finally, a reboot set the matter right, yet with a reduced step count. The S/W needs a check."
"Very useful... For a while. Its one of those fitness apps where it's working and you can use it really well but then the nuances like certain customisation options not even being there become very clear. Like not even having an option to change the cal measurements to kJ, there's not even an option to choose what country you're in so it can adjust it's food options to to what you're actually eating, forcing you to input the food manually. The app is a good app, if you're an American."
"The weight management feature was the greatest part of this app and it's gone with the updates. Can I get it back somehow? I wouldn't mind using the older version of the app if that's possible.The weight manage feature was very useful to keep my kcal consumption and intake balanced. Plus, the update turned every tap in nutrient balance feature into green, which makes you feel like you've eaten healthy even when it's not the case."
"This used to be a good app but it will not connect with other apps and charges for intermediary apps that should not be required. Furthermore they have been promising for years (""literally"" used grammatically correctly) to connect the watches to oxygen levels but in Canada they are such sloths they have not even applied. So, in sum, what little they do is good but insufficient to use their products or their apps in my opinion. Contract is up in November and looking for new devices and apps."
"oh my god it's the most infuriating login process I've seen. I've resetted the password numerous times, used password manager, I had to change the password because I haven't changed it in a while, I had to set up 2 step verification - all for a stupid fitness app. I gave up after many tries and switched to the Google app, where login is just one button. I have a Samsung watch but you made logging in to your up such a nightmare that I don't use it."
"Nice App. Would be 4 or 5 except there is no desktop app and no ability to properly analyze workout data, except in very pre-determined high level ways. There seems to be limited options for the audio coach during workouts as well. Other fitness apps have figured this all out. Samsung you should do the same"
"Anyone who is planning on buying any Samsung Smartwatch, beware. The Samsung Health App does not take heart rate in to account for calculating calories burned and the ""calories burned"" value updates infrequently and is grossly incorrect. All of the disclaimers in the world for ""health information is flr guidance only"" do not excuse how a flagship feature is so inadequate."
"I wish we could select the size of the glass of water. For example, I don't consume water in glasses, I always use a bottle since I work full-time and is just easier that way abd I'm sure many people think so too. So, selecting the size of the glass and we being able to stop/start the step counting by the notification bar would be amazing and really put this app above others."
Refuses to let me use it unless I give it my phone number so other people can find me..... Get freaking real. No thank you. Can you at least pretend to respect our privacy?--- it literally says it uses my number to find people with my phone number. That's not respecting someone's privacy at all....
"On the whole I like this app and find it works well, but due to an injury find it doesn't register when I climb stairs. It would be really good if there you was an ability to add the floors climbed each day in manually, like you can adjust sleep records or allow for individual gaits to be recognised so it makes it at least close to accurate. This has been a failing over all the samsung apps that support their fitness watches."
Edit: bring back weight management feature! Why did you remove it?? This unfortunately affects my star rating of the app. Original: I would love the gear fit2 pro to have the same excercise list as the app. in my case I would like aqua aerobics as it's a water sport so I cant track it with my phone . I have to use alternative excercise but it's not accurate.
"I have been using this app for years to track my running workout, I bought a new Samsung device a year ago specifically so I could continue to use it. The past few months however the tracker regularly stops every two minutes or so while I'm running. Really annoying when I'm in the middle of a workout and have to slow down to turn on the tracker manually. Could you fix this? It been an issue since 10/2019. I'm using an S8."
Doesn't sync the phone with the watch and don't say connected. It's just getting worse by day no communication between watch and Samsung health even after I reinstalled it and clean the cache. Dubois County steps but in the middle of the day the calorie steps and time disappear. On the phone only steps nothing else from one of the other day it completely sucked
Billion times better than Google's health app. Often buggy though. And oddly on the history for running there is no map of where you have been. That's the main feature I'm actually wanting. So I can see where exactly I ran fastest how long I maintained the pace of that stretch of road and see the improvement. Seems like something that should be a main feature
"The app is quite good and allows recording of food and tracking of exercise. However recent updates have been backward steps. Since the most recent update, the app now requires more key strokes to record food eaten. Also since the update the app uses lots more battery. In summary a good app, but some poor UI changes and a possible battery issue in recent versions."
The fact that you are forced to give permissions to things to allow for features that you dont want makes this junk useless regardless of how good the program would be otherwise.
"Not everything about the apps use is 100% intuitive but once you figure it out it's totally fine. For example you need to turn off the watches auto-detect for workouts if you are manually starting a workout via the app. No big deal to turn off the auto detect, or delete the duplicate workout record afterwards. I like this app a lot overall and it helps me track my activity, that's why I give five stars despite a few minor quirks here and there."
I used to love this app. After this latest update.... I'm upset. Though the graphics looks nice but some features are missing. For example average weight over days or weeks or months. The average feature not uniform for all measurement. Export data is good but please retain the feature to just view too. Same goes for others. Samsung you have just made a good working app worst......
Used to be able to connect to my other non-samsung smart watch but after an update am unable to
Tha heck! Keeps recording my long distance bus rides as walks??! ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
"I find this app useful, but there are some annoying features. For the food tracking, I hate that the portions are controlled by a slider that starts with a default. Sometimes it takes forever to scroll to the right amount - I wish you could type in values or have another, more suitable input method. Another issue is that it keeps disconnecting from my Strava account. I have to reconnect Strava in Settings every few weeks and I cannot understand why."
There is issue in step counting. It count car / bus travel as step.
"Update 10/02/22: I had contacted support before posting my review but their recommendations didn't resolve the issue. What did resolve it was tightening my watch band, although I hadn't lost weight and new tightness can be a bit uncomfortable. 09/30/22: Sleep record synch stopped working. Starting yesterday, my sleep data from my Samsung Galaxy3 watch is unable to synch with the Samsung Health app. Updated watch software and app software, rebooted phone, no luck. All other data synchs fine."
"I really like this app in conjunction with my watch. But the latest update has changed something that I really liked. I am no longer able to incorporate ""exercise"" as one of my goals that completes the heart on my watch. Please bring back choices for goals."
"App keeps crashing, isn't updating steps etc. when I go on it, it just stops and freezes, also isn't showing the stress levels either. I have never had a problem with the app until recently. If it's due to a recent update, it hasn't done a lot of good, basically it's made the app unusable and needs to be sorted asap, especially if there isn't another app I can use for my Samsung watch. It was all brilliant up until now, so why has it gone so bad?????"
"Love it. Been using this for a few days and it's great. You should issue a patch for the auto pedometer issue previously mentioned. Would be good to have a ""share app"" option as I've been promoting it to my friends but they'd be more likely to start using if I could send them a nice link to download from the store. Would recommend having a target type option for each activity ie distance or calories and a measurement tracker would be awesome instead of having to track this via another app."
The total burned calories is very inaccurate as in if you bmr shows you burn 2020 calories a day and then your activity calories that is your additional calories burned is 1000 your total burned calories for the the day is 3020.. then the app will show it as 2800 total calories
"Really wanted to use this for my watch and to track some useful information. The app just simply put me in an endless loop of trying to sign in and to set up 2 step verification. Over. And over. And over. Despite confirming all was good to go, it just asks me to log in or do it all again. Reinstalled twice thinking maybe it's my fault and a different email, didn't even make it to the actual app. Disappointed"
"Not particularly impressed with the latest app update. It still does most of what I want it to, but visually it looks like we took a step back. The one thing that I can't seem to find is looking at the weight tracking by month. It seems that you can only look at individual days now. Not quite as useful to see longer term trends."
"The app has stopped working or syncing with my watch at all. I've tried uninstalling and re installing it. Also tried disconnecting and reconnecting bluetooth but still nothing happens. It's now utterly useless to me. This happened all of a sudden and ""help"" are no help. This has happened again and no matter what I do to caches nothing works. This app is really a pain. Is there nothing you can do to stop this happening again and again? I'm not in the US so cannot call for support."
Step counter not working anymore. I did the last update and it seems the step counter shows 0 even i walk pretty a lot.
"The app and the watch 4 classic were working perfect.... until the last update last week. Now it's not giving breakup off my sleep. REMs and patterns, and asking me every morning to confirm whether i was asleep on the times, which is really annoying. Can this be fixed please? Also the auto detect of exercises is being deleted from the records without any warning."
"The Women's health part is okay but it is only geared towards young women who are in their fertile years. Please add trackers for those of us starting menopause. I don't like a lot of apps on my phone and it is annoying having to have 1 separate app to track ""getting older""."
"It's unfortunate that the continuous heart rate graph has been removed. Now there's just a graph with minimal and maximal value for an hour and you basically have very limited use of it. Why not give the user the choice as before? Because it is a key feature for me using the watch 4, I can't rate the app higher. Looking for alternatives now. Why Samsung?"
"Very good app, really like the design and simple layout, lots of workout options to record too! If I could add one feature it it would be to be able to save a set workout which can be used again for another day, rather than having to record the same workout every day manually."
"It's heartbreaking to see that my favourite features of the app were recently removed. The weight management and calorie counter features worked great for me while they were still available. Now, without them, the app is much less valuable in my daily routine. Really disappointed in the recent changes"
Heart rate measurement never works. It just tells me to make sure my finger is on the sensor. My finger is always in the middle of the sensor and glowing bright red from its light so that shouldn't be a problem. Now the app won't load. It's getting stuck on a setup screen. Also I don't want to be forced to set up 2 step verification just to use this.
Used to love using this app. Step counter is horrible. I'm a truck driver and it records thousands more steps than I actually walk when driving. Pretty useless.
This app is showing that can't set up app my android version is 8.1.0 which is compatible with this app still this is not opening. Please fix it out
"Since last update, daily activity does not work. Please fix."
This app was working great until a phone upgrade recently. Now the audio notification during exercise mode is hit and miss. Tried upgrading but found no new upgrade. Really miss that part. Update. just received another phone update earlier today and now everything is back to normal. Thanks for that!! This app updated last night and this morning it has same problem. Getting frustrating.
"App is still working, and over the past years it has improved. But within the last week I had to disable the permission to track automatically as it was using over 30% of my phone battery, a pixel 6 pro. Hopefully there will be an update to the app or the Pixel to fix this. Note Samsung suggested clearing the cache, which was done but it is still using 30% of phone battery. Again disabled the auto track and battery use went away. Thanks for fixing the battery drain. Everything is back to normal."
"Samsung Health works well for me, tracking my sleep patterns and recording the fitness data gathered by my Samsung Watch. However the software has a basic problem recording flights of stairs, as it ignores anything less than 17 steps. This is fine in the commercial word, but does not work in a domestic setting where most stairs are around 15 steps. After reading other reviews, the problem may be with the Galaxy Watch software, but it is still a problem."
"Used to love this app but since the Dec 21 update it has been hopeless. It now only records only a fraction of my steps, which is a basic function and my main reason for using it. It is also much harder to add your own workout data eg for a swimming session. I going to have to look for a replacement. Very annoyed."
"For the food tracking bit, can you please add a feature ""+Add your recipe"", it would be really useful. Most of the items referring to cooked recipes are from the US and they do not contain a clear list of ingredients, quantities, It would be best to be able to create, add and use your own recipes. Thanks"
"Apparently you won't be able to sync steps with a Fitbit/Google fit or other device as of the end of the month. There's no good reason to remove this functionality. Presumably this was done to deter ""cheating"" but if so it's a foolish decision because a) it won't prevent people from cheating b) who cares if people cheat on their step count? There are no cash prizes here - the point of the app is to track fitness so anyone who is recording false steps is only cheating themselves! There are other irritants as well: - detected (not manually started) workouts don't count for records [like longest workout] for no apparent reason - manually-set workouts aren't a workaround as they have their own problems: -if you go for a ""walk"" on a treadmill/etc. the detected workout gives lots of info such as distance traveled and pacing info but if you manually start the exercise you can run for an hour and will be shown 0 distance/pacing information. - if you select a workout type like treadmill or elliptical (instead of walking) it throws out all the useful info (like distance traveled and pacing info) and instead just shows you your step count. Since the app already tracks a step count without needing to start a workout the feature is useless as it adds nothing that isn't already present. The last straw was discovering today the surprise and unjustifiable decision to remove the ability to sync steps from a fitbit/other device/google fit - as of June 30, 2020 - which will probably force me to switch since while I have tolerated the other annoyances this newest surprise feature removal renders the app useless to me since the only thing I want it to track is my exercise. EDIT: Apologies for the block of text but apparently Google thinks reviews are easier to read if it strips out all the formatting and mashes everything into a wall of text."
"I'm very annoyed by current version on my Gear S3. Each time that I check the progress of my workout, it's paused. I spent 20 minutes running on a treadmill, but it only recorded 2:07 minutes. So discouraged that I stopped my workout immediately. VERY DISAPPOINTED!!! I'm not going to make an international call to wherever 1-855 is to give more details. Samsung can call or email me. Basic issue: running rhythm changes even slightly, the app pauses the workout. Manual resume instruction expected"
"I loved this app (considered it a 5 star) until the recent update. Two reasons why it has gotten worse... 1. There are ads at the top. (Most are Samsung, but one was for H&R Block.) I live in Canada, so this is definitely happening here. 2. The bug one for me is there is only one snack entry spot now. There used to be three. I track my food for each time I eat. Lumping all my snack food into one spot with just a single time stamp. I need to know exactly what food I am eating, and when!"
"Have used this app for sometime now and it was perfect until as many comments have mentioned, the weight management section has disappeared!!!! In order to try and work around this I have tried to manually set a calorie target but everytime I do within no time at all the calorie target reverts back to what it was originally. So frustrating. Please can you provide a UK contact number or email address to contact in order to discuss this. This app is minimal use without this function!!"
"I used to love this app and would of given four or five stars, but I have uninstalled it when the updates required access to manage phone calls and contacts. This is a fitness app and I don't see the need for such requirements. I have reinstalled several times hoping that this may have changed but not the case. This is very disappointing Samsung please change back. I am only giving one star because I have to."
"A recent update seems to have messed up this app. It no longer records steps accurately. In fact today I had noticed that it had already counted 5000 odd steps but when I checked later it showed only 477. Also, it has recorded today's date as April 25th, which is a future date. I have a screenshot but I don't know how to add it. Please update quickly to address these bugs. Thanks"
"Used this app for couple years though. Really enjoying it! Not quite happy with a new version as loads of users as well, on my opinion the older version was more comfortable and easier to use. Also, with a new version my steps counting keep on freezing, so I have always check my phone, is the app still counting them steps... Gave you 5 stars as you solved my problems quickly, thank you! And also because I really love this app, it helps a lot to be fit and track all achievements as well as workouts."
This app is good but not working now. I have already tried everything you have suggested. After deleting my data from server it is showing access denied error and crashed. Online customer support cannot solve the issue. I think this app keep all of its data online. There should be provision that even if it can not store the data online it can start and keep the data offline.
"Samsung, it is not good enough that the app requires access to your phone and contacts to work since it has been updated - regardless of what you say about how you will manage that data, as a user I should not need to give you access to that info for it to work.I completely agree with others posting about the same issue. Your answer in each case has been a standard response and frankly does not address the issue. It was a good app - not anymore!"
"They get worse with every update. The most recent update removed the weight management option for seemingly no reason. Since I was mainly using the app for calorie and weight management it's now half useless and I'm looking into moving to fitbit because Samsung health just keeps removing useful features. I wouldn't recommend it for anyone trying to lose weight or just track their calorie intake because they just removed one of the most useful features for that. 1 star, try fitbit instead."
"I have been using the app with my S10+ and Watch 3 and it has been working fine. I was already a bit disappointed by the fact that the app does not have a web presence where some information would be easier to check, but the big surprise was when I found out that the app is not compatible with the S7 tablet device which is Samsung's flagship model for tablets. Are there any plans to have this device supported in the near future?"
"The latest update requires you to hand over to Samsung, FULL access permissions to your phone's data to enable ""optimal user experience"". I refuse to allow this app and Samsung to have unfettered access to my camera, files and media, phone, contacts and location. It's ridiculous and disproportionate to the function of the app. Uninstall."
"So happy now we have dark mode. But PLEASE make the splash screen dark too! Also, I really miss having smaller ""items"" so you can have floors & active time on the same line for example. Being able to choose if they were full size or half size would be great. Save all the scrolling to see all the amazing things I can track."
I have updated the app which was absolutely fine but now I can not even get into it ... you have to do a two step verification - I can't even get through the first let alone the 2nd. It's very frustrating as I entered my phone number then receive the code ... but click on the verify I'm back to square one. Absolutely fed up !!! Samsung sort it out will you please!!!
"Has been great for years, but as of today it now crashes when I activate cycling in exercise. This is really annoying as I cannot track my rides with it anymore. Update: 03/05/20. The App has stopped crashing, but instead just doesn't record my bike rides correctly. The original issue seemed to be to do with GPS and the latest issue seems GPS related as well. Instead of mapping my ride it now takes a couple of random points on the journey draws a straight line between them. Then it just stops."
"Nice features but I want to be able to enter my actual stride length to get more accurate distances. And I'd like clarity on how it calculates calories expended. The software seems to have issues with communicating with my Gear S3 watch, the step count and distance and calories expended differ than what my watch indicates. Are the supposed to be the same or even close? I'm using Galaxy Wearable as well. not sure if the communication issue lay there."
Since last update my Samsung S8 no longer automatically records my sleep. It seems even though it worked fine before Samsung seem to be trying to push people to buy additional gadgets for functionality that is built into my phone. As a sufferer of sleep apnea it's been useful but if you have taken it out then it's useless to me. There is no point in contacting customer support you have removed the functionality it had to just work off my phone and I'm not about to pay to call you from the UK.
"App was working great, then switched to new phone. Two step verification but the number the text is being sent to isn't mine. Deleted app and reinstalled. Still the same issue. Hopeless. Thanks for the reply to my review. I can't do as suggested and go to the support team as I can't get past the two step verification as I previously stated the number the text is being sent to is not my number. So I'm stuck."
"Have enjoyed using in the past but won't let me in now without agreeing to share information it hasn't needed in order to function previously and I'm not willing to agree to. And yes Samsung people I've seen your standard answer ""for implementing app features and providing optimal experience"" (see I'm clever enough to copy and paste all by myself!). Problem is that a lot of us seem to agree that our experience was far more optimal and we used more app features before this. Very disappointed üò•"
"I liked this app before the update there were some quarks for sure but it was usable. I did give it a try . Several times to see if it would wear in on me. It never did. I've actually switched to fitbit until there are some changes With my gear fit 2 pro, and the app. To many little things stacked up to make me frustrated with the entire fitness platform. Really disappointed right now because I loved my phone so much I was hoping the wearable and fitness would be just as amazing. Keep trying Samsung. You can fix this."
"Since the app changed I cannot even sign in. Wouldn't send the verification email. Now it sends the code but won't let me push the verify button. Such simple things, whoever did the changes obviously didn't know what they were doing. I will switch to something else. Nothing to do with permissions. I accepted the permissions. As stated above the verify button wouldn't work once I put the code that was texted to me in."
"The information density went way down with this new update. Sad development, it adds no new functionality, it only adds a cumbersome action (scrolling down). Looks neat, keep everything the same (overall design), but revert the to the blocks, with high information density. Edit: still no options in the settings for getting the old design back"
"A really useful tool for tracking ALMOST everything effecting your health and wellbeing. well done Samsung (Revision) There are some annoying inconsistencies with this app, for instance most milks apparently don't contain calcium?... and also when adding your own food, when asking for a percentage of RDA for vitamins/minerals, what it actually wants is grams/milligrams/ micrograms/IU. I would also really like it if there were a way to track/set goals for sugar intake. Please improve on this!"
"It was working till the recent Android10 OS update. Afterwards, it started giving problems like walking sessions break in the middle, in case of Screen timeouts steps are not counted at all. Further, the walking sessions are breaking at only 10 or 11 minutes instead of the complete session, which was never happened before the OS update. All methods have been applied and of no use at all, even after log files forwarded. How to reach you customer support which is not reachable from India."
Good app but for some reason its counting more steps than I'm actually doing. I had a S7 edge before i changed to a A70 & got myself a Samsung smart watch with it. On the S7 i could calibrate my step length but i can't seem to find the option on the new phone. Been reading online that other people are having the same problem aswell. Would be good if they could add the feature/function to the app again to record the step count more accurately.
"This app is above average however it has a couple of issues. The inability to add or remove exercises from the list given. There should be a way to add an exercise and to remove everything else to shorten the list to activities you do. In the food portion the lowest you can go is a half a cup, should be able to go to a 1/4 or 1/8 of a cup or have another adjustment line for ounces. A bar code scanner would be a nice addition to scan food in."
I totally agree with other reviews - Weight Management was the most useful feature (I lost 20kg through it in 2018) and I don't know why it was taken away. I recently bought the Samsung watch to help streamline where my data is stored and so the watch integrated with the tech I already used - I don't want to use many different apps like myfitnesspal/Gear. I need health tracking to be a small and easy part of my day and the previous version with Weight Management was perfect.
"I was very happy with the old version. Not sure if Samsung upgraded the app or downgraded it. I use Android wear and Samsung health to record my workouts. But after the new Samsung upgrade the app is mis-calculating my run data. The total distance covered, speed per km and speed / hour was absolutely wrong. Disappointed. Pls fix the issue or let me know how to switch back to older version."
"This used to be a great app and I continue to use an earlier version of the app to manage my training and weight management all together. They made a dogs dinner out it since last summer. And since then I have been uninstalling the auto update, which I have so called disabled, and reinstall the earlier version, until hopefully Samsung come to their senses and revert back to having those features again- esp needed during lockdown!"
"Great disappointment following update The widget used to be transparent, ideal because data was instantly visible but widget was invisible - now data is in an ugly white block, I've had to move it from my front screen because it's too intrusive. This means it's no longer as useful. This change is very user-unfriendly, please could it be reversed, or is there a simple fix I have failed to find despite extensive searching?"
"I used this app faithfully and it helped me lose 36lbs and get back in shape. I would monitor my stats (calories in, calories burned, steps and various other data). However, since a couple of months ago, I've been having to enter my calorie target every day and some other functions were removed so I stopped using the app. Tried it again today and it's the same. Unfortunate. This (even while being constantly advertised at) was the best app I've used. I'll have another look at the Under Armour app"
i have had very disappointing experience with this App and have now stopped using it. It kept disconnecting itself off Discovery. Now I note that my husband is having the exact same problem. he linked the App a few weeks ago with Discovery but noticed that lately he has not been getting his points for running. we checked and the App is no longer linked. Disappointing.
"Personally, I think it's a brilliant app and I love it. However, the together competition and/or idea is amazing, but too many fake counts and hacks. Would love to see this controlled better. No one is walking 70 to 100km per day, every day of the month. It's humanely impossible. But, the same id's and people are claiming these counts on a daily and monthly basis."
"I love the app, but please make it register personal bests from auto-detected workouts as well. As for now, you can only set personal bests for anything other than steps only if you start a workout session in the app. For auto-detected workouts the data is still there, but it doesn't compare and input it in the personal records tab."
"The app is still dog"""""""" why do I have to scroll through my notifications when I'm running to try and click the pause button while running. Check Huawei feature. Has a big pause button on the lock feature so you don't have to mess around unlocking your phone when running or clear all your apps. New updates come along and the feature still doesn't improve. Obviously big company that doesn't care about its customers reviews"
"Heart Rate monitor is very finicky, 7/10 time it will tell me to 'place your finger on the sensor correctly' even when I have, and sometimes when I adjust my finger it still says I need to put my finger on the sensor correctly. I love this app, it helps me monitors many things but when this happens I just get upset because I don't want to have a seperate app to measure many different things."
"Auto updated without consent, now wants access to camera, phone logs, files. Won't work without giving access. I did use this app almost daily, but I'm not giving access to phone call logs to count steps and other sensory data. It isn't needed, isn't proportional to the purpose of the app, and it's disgusting the app no longer works without allowing access. I won't be buying another Samsung phone."
Rewriting my review for a third time -You have ads running at the top of the app. I'm not the only one who sees them. The ads takes 1/3rd of the page. Before you respond with 'it doesnt contain ads' when you download the app it says 'contains ads' - You're macro nutrients bars are still difficult to read - Why cant I track my weight from weeks/months? It only lets me see it daily. -Stop forcing auto updates and let us return to the original and simplistic UI. Your changes are a detriment
Before the app was good but recently since new updates there is some problem with the data permission. The step counting wont sync with other apps. I tried everything reinstalling. Resetting but nothing works. Not even able to switch off the data permission. It doesnt work at all. Please check with third party data permisssion which is not working properly.
"Tried getting into this but it's pretty silly. For example, you go to record an exercise, I did pull-ups, and it measures the length of time you did pull ups for. Doesn't ask you what kind of pull-ups, or how many you did, and I very much doubt it takes your weight into account when counting the calories used. The sleep recorder doesn't seem to have any way to record if you woke up in the night and for how long. Pretty basic, I'm disappointed."
"This app used to be great, but not anymore. My watch still counts floors, but they aren't tracked in the app, if I forget to sync daily the previous days steps won't update, the weekly summary doesn't show on the app until the end of the following week, despite my watch showing me the data on a Monday....I wish the app had never updated, it's awful!"
"Good app but please add skateboarding as an activity! It's quite frustrating when your primary physical activity isn't included with so many other diverse sports and exercises. May I also suggest splitting skateboarding into several activities (vertical, riding, longboarding, street , etc). I believe the added feature would receive praise from many and further the community which uses the app."
"On Samsung Galaxy Watch: 1. For training based on sets/reps after completing each set it automatically sets a rest time of 1 minute, internally it works as expected, it always lates 1 minute, but if I turn on the watch screen the watch UI resets the countdown to 1 minute (but internally the time continues with the old countdown). 2. Abs workout sometimes doesn't detect the training session. 3. Front and lateral raises are so sensitive, they detect a rep with the minimum wrist movement."
"I loved my old samsung health. It helped me lost mt weight so far. But I don't love it anymore started 2 days ago just after it updated. They cut out weight management. In weight management, you can see if your body intake and outtake are balance or not. Total calories of your intake and total calories of your activity. It showed you how many calories you have to burn until end of the day. Or it showed you if you are balanced. Or maybe you need to eat some more! But it gone. Now how will I track my calories??? I am very disappointed. It is really backward, big one."
The latest update looks more appealing but thats really where the improvements stop for me. When I'm recording my weight i used to be able to track it over a weekly or monthy basis. As this function is gone I'll be looking for another app which can offer this. Its unhealthy for me to obsess over how my weight fluctuates on a daily basis and with the new layout (without options to track progress over longer amounts of time) it no longer suits my needs.
Just awful will not let me use it keeps saying needs 2 step identification even after i do it it just resets and goes in a loop of never opening üò° i needed this to use with smart watch
Setting weight loss targets is now impossible. The app now only let's me set weight gain
"Team, I'm not sure if this option is available. I have two Samsung phones registered with same email ID on both and sync is enabled. But whenever i do activities using any of the phones, the data on the other device(which is not with me) doesn't get synced with what is already recorded on the phone that i used for the activity. Ex. If i record that i have consumed 6 glasses of water on either of the phones, the data on the other phone(which is not with me) should also get updated with 6 glasses."
"Simply doesn't work anymore! I have a Huawei phone but a Samsung smartwatch. I rarely go into the app but wanted to check some stats from a few recent runs. The app won't even open, I've uninstalled but still no joy. I then found out if you press and hold the app icon and select the steps it can show you the steps screen, but the main dashboard in the app is totally broken for me. Renders the app useless!"
"I find the app pretty unintuitive to use. I try to use it mostly to track how much I walk, but the walking detection is very unreliable - for example last week if I look at steps there is a day where I walked 16.5 km (and indeed I spent about four hours walking) yet no walking was recorded for that day in the Exercise section! Responding to the developer comment: the pedometer works, the steps and distance are counted, but no ""walking workout"" is detected, so it doesn't appear under ""walking""."
"It's okay. Doesn't record walks and runs so well. Often breaks up my run into two or three sometimes even four separate runs, even tho there were no stops. Kind of defeats the purpose of tracking a work out of it can't track the work out. But it's a free app and it's alright. Oh and seriously over estimates my steps in a day, by a tonne."
"I like the app, not a massive fan of the update but still serves its purpose. The really annoying part is the inaccurate mins/km while running. Like it will tell me I'm running 8'45/km in my ear and when I finish it says my average pace was 6'01/km. I've learnt to ignore it but it is nice to know your pace while actually running. My boyfriend has had the same problem since the update too."
"I purchased the Samsung Active 2 watch to go along with this app for a complete experience and it has been terrible. It rarely tracks my steps, occasionally tracts flights of stairs, and customer service has been useless. I replaced the less expensive Fitbit charge 2 for the Samsung and Fitbit was a better choice. I would give this 5 stars if it did what it was supposed to do. It advertises as a perfect smart watch, app combo ."
"I liked it, but now it is broken, and I am looking into other options. Fortunately for me I don't have Samsung health gears and can migrate easy. Samsung choose to go Apple way. Nice looking application, but there is no flexibility and no user's control how to manage their data. One only snack did application for me helples. All details of my historical data lost (not first time with app). I liked it keeped dozen of previous meal to quick reuse, but it killed now second time by update. Awful."
The update has made the tracking of meals and macro nutrition extremely frustrating. The previous version was much better. One can also no longer check average weekly and monthly body mass. In short I for one would be much happier with the old version . Am currently going to look for a another app to do my daily tracking until such time as this app is improved .
"It's the best app I've used so far. But just on a side note: Make that woman stop (or at least enable me to choose to stop her from) telling me how much is left of my workout till I'm done; it's really, really annoying. stops my music and stresses me out. I don't ALWAYS want to know about my pace and workout time and all of the other weird stuff she keeps on stating. Thanks! PS. I love the new challenge thing. Just earned my first badge and I'm overjoyed!"
"I have my cellphone and active 2 watch connected and whenever I take a walk with both devices steps are doubled. This is ultra confirmed! I don't know what's worst, that the bug actually exists or seeing forums from 8+ months ago reporting the issue and seeing how Samsung doesn't give a ü§¨. Actually a very useful app thrown straight to the trash by an amazingly stupid bug!"
"Samsung Health was once great, however, the constant updates and their need to tinker with it has made it obsolete and inferior software. It is 2020 and the software is unable to sync to pretty much any other fitness apps. Now to top it off the introduction of credentials for Dev Mode has ruined SyncMyTracks. Meaning exercise recorded with Samsung Health is stuck there. They should leave the software to those more capable who don't feel the need to constantly ""update"" and remove features."
"Cannot set data permissions in settings at all. It is permanently grayed out for all other apps. Reinstalled Samsung health app, but that did not solve the problem. using with galaxy fit tracker and wanted to share data with another app s. Using latest version of Samsung health, fit Plugin and wearable software. EDIT: to set data permissions, put the app into developer mode by going to the About screen, then tapping the version number until it changes."
"App only records 36 calories no matter how many hours you've been running for, that's if you are listening to music with another App and both running at the same time on Samsung S20 FE.it used to work fine when I was using the Samsung S7 Edge. UPDATE its only right to make corrections as I was quick to knock the App in the first place. I have sorted the above by turning on location in the App. It now not only gives me my distance in kilometres ran, it also gives the right time including a map"
"Extremely bad new version. Why do I need this Application if it doesn't count calories spent vs calories taken? Heart rate, steps and activity can count any fitness watch, even the cheapest and the oldest. And this version of Application is useless. Waiting till the next update, and if doesn't change- I'll have to change the Application and maybe also the devices."
Your new update is ridiculously dumb. All the features that I used are now gone. I'm particularly annoyed at the trends tab for weight having gone missing - it was so motivating being able to clearly see the numbers going down. Not being able to add morning and afternoon tea and see clearly the calories consumed. Please please please change it back to what it was before - it was soooo much better.
"One of the apps I like alot by Samsung. Alot of useful features relevant to me and comes in handy. I like keeping track of daily exercise so You can get a graph of your fitness monthly. That is if it saves your information correctly and your phone syncs properly. This app is great. Very useful, handy and I love this one. Hope it keeps the bugs away. Great Job so far. 10/10"
"I live in Australia which uses the international system of units (SI). I don't understand why Samsung is yet to have an option for changing the unit of measurement from kcal to kilojoule. I can change all other measurements to the metric system, but cannot change the energy. I find it particularly frustrating, that we have these smart devices (phone and watch) and I have to manually convert kj to kcal and back again. Catchup with the times Samsung and add it as an option!"
Very very disappointed with this app. I have just tried to look for my total steps over the year and nothing. I can only check specific days or over a month but not a running total since I started using this. I will have to go back to using my fitbit instead. Very disappointed with you Samsung you seem to be going backwards.
"Feels more modern after the update, which was long due. The monthly walking challenges are fun, but it's really disappointing that people are cheating (a large number of people are doing 200000 steps by midday on the 1st day, which is impossible). This means you don't get an accurate ranking."
The app is good but the step count & sleep tracking is not accurate as compared to fit bit... I bought the galaxy watch 4 just because I had high expectations with the new OS and the exynos w920 chip set... But the experience has been sub par especially in the health features- detection and accuracy. That said it's a beautiful watch with great features otherwise... Do respond if there is an update we can look forward to and by when?
"Excellent app, only yesterday I had a trouble that while exercising the app said workout paused many times!!! And i had to resume manually each time!!! Tried your tips and still not working for a month now ! I was able to solve it on my own, on s8 plus model, open mobile settings, choose (device care) then choose (battery), open (Samsung health), at the bottom there's an option called (Put app to sleep), make sure to disable it. Hope that helps anyone who had the same issue."
"Must have 3-4 apps to make it work. * does not sync, or syncs with wrong values, even when performed manually * IF it syncs correcly it does after a few hours * the watch disconnects fast, even at 5 meters away, and I am not living in a steel reinforced concrete building. Disappointing, to say the least. Any additional words would be cursing ü§¨ üòí Was a present, but will remove Samsung products of my life. Cluttering proprietary unnecessary apps, poor feasability products, low resistance in use."
"I'm only giving one star because that's the lowest that's available on play store. If you're someone doing cardio/ HIIT, then it's far more better to stay away from this and use a third party app for tracking your vitals. For the past 3+ years, samsung health has never been able to track my heartrate if it's over 120ish. Some of the apps that are freecan do a better job. Disappointed."
"Super nice. It connects to Strava and gets my ride data into a single place. I wish my Samsung A71 could 1) connect to budget/cheaper accessories (cadence sensors, HRM, etc) and that this App offered a) improved ways to filter, group and visualize datasets; b) the possibility to add in/customize the items on the front page (bring back stuff that we tend to consume that require to be properly monitored, eg. ‚òï andüç∫); c) added some body measurement (manual inputs)"
"Can't use app without allowing full permissions. You have to allow the app to access your contacts, camera, files and manage phonecall or you can't use the app at all. You also have to set up two factor authentication. I used it before and liked it but it's completely useless to me now and so is the smart watch for fitness"
"The app is OK but does not allow for forward planning of meals, for example putting in tomorrow's food today. The Fat Secret database is used, but their app can scan Food and their desktop version (Samsung should akso consider this) let's you plan ahead as much as you need, which is a really useful tool for both gaining and losing weight. Also the app only records auto activated activity so any steps you did just moving around are not recorded when you look back at your weeks steps achievements."
That's one of the best apps for healthy can i use. Please add total walking count and more detailsüëç
"It was such a nice app before. But now, you removed all the workouts, only some particular workouts are available. And it keeps tracking my steps. I can't turn it off. It pops up on my notification bar always. Please bring back the workouts. If not for the workouts and the new changes of the app, I would've given 5 stars. + Please add whole body workouts by cho rong park."
Error occurred can't open app. Fix this IMMEDIATELY.
"Sync is not automatic even if it says it is. I just moved to a new phone and lost 3 months of data because the feature that they call as ""auto sync"" DOES NOT actually sync unless you manually trigger it. This is such horrible user experience, so misleading... One would think that a leading smartphone brand has UX testers than this."
Every since last update always get a notification saying samsung health has started pops up like every hour very frustrating
I wanted this watch to track my sleep pattern but it doesn't register when i go to sleep its always wrong and thinks i stay up until 4am when i go to bed by 12
First time I've used this app in a while and I notice the map has gone when u start your walk too see how far you've gone.anyone know where it is on the app
With the new update my 5 pro watch consistently has a different step count than my phone. Help!
For some reason the app stopped counting my steps at the beginning of February. Not sure why
Love the app but lately it hasn't been displaying the steps into on the my notification pageof the phone.
Samsung Watch 4 is not recording sleep correctly. Mainly napping it is not even recording
Since update steps aren't working. I have notification and steps on.
Galaxy watch5 is ment to be used only with Samsung phones... Nearly imposible to use with Xiaomi.
I update this app and the steps wont show up until now. Updating the app sucks!
Cannot find blood oxgen graph. Update: I received help from another user to show where and how to get to this graph.
Unable to connect to Google fit and so can't upload on other apps like healthify
I couldn't get past the two step verification process. This app is unusable.
Great app easy to use and it has plenty of great features that are free as well ‚ò∫Ô∏è
My exercise equipment is a Gazelle. I would like to see that as a choice on your menu.
The walking app works well but the biking app doesn't appear to work at all
Loved it til th cycle tracking changed Now doesn't work properly. Will have to find a new app
"After the new update, the step count isnt showing on my popup screen..."
Good app for tracking training. I sincronyce with my Samsung Active watch 2.
Suddenly crashing on S23Ultra. Phone says there is a bug in the program
Terrible update the only way my steps are couting is if I have it open on my phone or watch 0 stars and I already did the setting thing ü§¨
Bring back thr ability to track stress and oxygen levels.
Its just ok. I don't use it for everything so I cant judge all aspects. One thing that bugs me is the floors feature - I dig counting the floors I climb but if you are even 1 step short of climbing a full flight of stairs it doesn't count that floor - it should at least keep track of half floors and then auto- multiply by two to be more accurate. It seems to track sleep ok. By shaking your smart watch while driving you can trick it into counting steps - the app should know I can't walk 80km/h!
Doesn't support Samsung EL HS10 scales. Could it be any more ridiculous?
New update won't display past days in daily activity. Fix your broken app samsung.
"Everything works fine after I clear the cache, thanks for the instructions."
"Not as intuitive as others. Also, the ac accessories option is not utd."
App doesn't support basic feature like water drinking reminder and bp monitoring.
Step counter stopped working since last update. Please fix!
Keep getting notifications that it restarted running over and over
"Hello,their is an issue I think with samsung health it calculates the steps though I'm on bike ..while I'm not actually walking Could you help please."
Not calculating steps properly no map of where I am walking ect needs sorting or it's pointless ppl using it
App forcing to provide phone number else it's giving error. Not a clean app.
Not working after 2 miles of running rhe app stop working very frustraid it
Nice app.. but i really cant edit my date of birth... Please if may can resolve this issue... Thanks
"It states you can measure ECG, but it is not on my app. Advice please?? My doc wants me to use this feature asap"
"Well, I can't get a server connection. Have had this app for years, so guess I'll have to find another one"
Please please please add pickleball to the exercise list. It is more popular than many.of.the others listed
"After the last update, the steps widget has become weird. Fix it."
The app didn't open on my phone it keep saying error and try again.
"The 6.19 version now doesn't show continuous heart visualisation, only average ranges, which is not useful to me. Widely believes to hide heart rate tracking innacuracies. I've had to uninstall and install the 6.18 version to restore this feature. If I can't have this feature in the future I will buy a fitness tracker from a different brand. Edit: Samsung's response was to contact them through the app but there is no need to do this as they aren't re-instating the feature."
"The app use to be fantastic as a big Samsung fan I went for the Note 9 and Galaxy watch, since doing the update the app crashes regularly and trying to register that you want to start running etc has another step inserted in it, not good not good at all. But much worse it crashes just after completing a run although thankfully it retains the data. Come on you can do better than this and if you can't please roll back to the last version it was much user friendly."
After a system update the health app has stopped counting my steps. I had to uninstall it and opwn it again to see if it worked. It is counting some but not working as well as it did. I alsi lost all my data from the last year. Whats the point of updating apps if they aren't as good as they were before??? So annoyed!
"This app let's me keep track of a lot of things - or a little things whichever I choose! I like being able to challenge myself and peers, and the global challenges often push me to get out there just a little more. east to use and customize. This is a great app for the beginner or moderate user. I have never had a problem with the app - and really reccomend it! Thanks Samsung!"
"The app is nice but doesn't work well when interacting with wearOS custom Watch faces as there is a glitch. Adding the heartbeat monitor or the daily activity doesn't send any data to the watch face, it just has a static icon that doesn't display any info. So it isn't really compatible with many watch faces which is frustrating, and pushes us towards Google fit which is more compatible. Hopefully it is fixed soon"
"*Update* Activity calories aren't displaying correctly. If you add up the individual activities in the 'Daily Activity' area, they don't add up. Now the app won't sync with my Samsung watch. Think it might be time to get a proper sports watch that actually works! Average app, every update seems to remove something that was useful or break something."
"I've been using this app for 5 months and lost a lot of weight using the weight management widget to stay on track. But yesterday there was an update that removed that widget and rendered the app useless. I feel lost without it and am afraid I'll loose progress since I don't know how long I should exercise now. I will likely go overboard in fear of gaining back. Until you put back the widget, I'll leave my 1 star review up. I'm not interested in your premade reply, don't bother."
Ever since the weight management feature has been removed I've actually been gaining weight back. The feature was a simple way for me to keep track of if I should move a bit more or skip a snack but since it's absence It's quick and elegant guidance has been removed from my life and it's actually caused me to stop caring as much.
"Update: I had a problem with logging in due to verification codes never actually reaching my phone despite several attempts during the day. After mentioning the issue, customer service were able to send me an email with steps to follow through, afterwhich I was able to log in. Kudos for the fairy immediate service! Now, in terms of utilization, the app is amazing! It has several features, my favourite of which are the challenges where you can have virtual runs and races with your friends."
"I loved this app until you removed the weight management tool for absolutely no reason. Without this feature this app is useless and I will need to look for an alternative. I hope you bring it back, because the feedback to your update shows that no one is happy with the changes and many people are considering different phones/watches ..."
"I would mark this as 5 star but you cannot adjust stride length or floor height which is really annoying as your data becomes inaccurate for steps and doors during the day. The fixed floor height is 10ft which is crazy seeing as most residential buildings in the UK have a floor around 8ft high!! THIS NEEDS TO BE ADJUSTABLE!! Other than that is a comprehensive fitness app, especially with the amount of workouts you can track."
"Too bad that ECG and blood pressure monitor don't work.. my watch keeps telling me to download the app, disappointed"
"its ok; however, when you look at other free service like Strava then its pretty useless. I want to be able to compare my runs to see where i can improve or if Im improving. Samsung.offers very basic logging and seems more interested in providing competition between friends. The data sharing with Strava is flaky. This really needs to be fixed."
"Once again, this app let me down during a walk. This time, recording did not resume following auto pause. Over 2 km of my walk did not get recorded. S_ Health's responce ro my previous review, and to other's who have written negative reviews, is for me to make an international phone call, to speak to them. They have demonstated that cusomer satisfaction is not their priority. My previous review was: While walking, the altitude call is total garbage. I walk along the beach, in the water at low tide, and the app tells me my altitude is anything between -70 meters to 30 meters. My first walk with the latest update gave totally false pace feedback,saying my last 2 km were up to 2.5 x longer than they actually were. The stress meter is usless. I am a better authority on my stress level, than a machine. The only useful feature I find on this app, is the GPS tracking of my walks,and the kilometer call outs. My previous rating was 3 stars, and after the upgrade, I have changed that to one."
Mostly useless app. Every month or two I open it to find that app doesn't work for very while and I have to accept some agreement Do not recommend
"I love this app....when it works. I have the auto detect on for walking and when I checked my history for the week, there are complete sessions not detected and charted.ü§®"
"Oh my goodness!!! What happened? After latest s health update. So many issues syncing with gear sport??? Synced but cant track data from watch, had to uninstall and reset everything. Now, a day later... the s health cant sync at all to the watch or says gear not connected. But!!!! The gear app is clearly connected and working fine, it can see the watch battery and all details. üò≠üò≠"
"Steps have been more and more inaccurate.. this is stressful, I have heart issues and I need to know my BPM and know what cals I'm burning for my Dr. Visits... trying fitbit next."
"I've been using Samsung Health to track my running and activity for years. It has been pretty reliable and easy to use. Lately, and I mean the last update or so after, the tracking has become less clear. I would run the same distance, same route, yet it would tell me I ran less. I'm not sure if the tracking is more accurate now, or what. But I did notice that my average speed data doesn't match pre-post update. There's no way I got 20 seconds slower over night."
"Keep notifying session expired. Tried login with wear app, still the same. N∆° my band keep having loading logo as well, nothing run"
Excellent app to keep track of everything love the step count and finding out how many miles you have done each day very easy to use and keeps you motivated each day to beat your target and eat better. Also love the food track option and useful tips and information on healthy eating in general. Very useful options to check heartbeat and stress and oxygen levels. Just great.
Really disappointed at the removal of floor counting widgets/ daily summary and goal records where the number of consecutive weeks achieved is gone. I've lost my two year record and motivation incentive to keep up my record. This data still appears to be recorded so why make it practically unusable! Very disappointed. Unlikely to get another galaxy watch when you keep removing great features for no apparent reason or warning.
"A perfectly usable app for every day use, but I would like to add my frustration at how the weight trends function has been limited to daily only. Averages, long term graphs etc were so useful. Now I might as well just use a notepad and pen. Please change this as soon as possible."
"I've been using this for several years. Worked great to keep track of my miles walking, bicycling. The app is still installed, but somehow the icon disappeared, and when I try to Open the app, it wants permission to see my camera, change settings, etc. What happened? I can't use it now. It was so easy before"
"The latest update to enable 2 step verification is not working. Does not allow me to acces the app unless it is setup and the setup does not complete as the verify button is disable after entering the code. Please have this fixed at the earliest. I can contact you via the app if it opens. It does not allow me to do anything apart from accepting the terms and enable 2FA. If I go back, it closes the app. Please let me know what are the other options to contact you?"
"The major issue isn't the app but the Samsung Active 2 watch which fails regularly, requiring a reset to get it going again.That means almost like clockwork, every few months, the watch fails and I lose my training data. I do like the app. It's comprehensive and intuitive. Unfortunately, Samsung won't let me export my training data so, when the watch fails, I lose it all. I have no choice but cut my losses and buy an Apple watch because it works and doesn't fail, like this one does."
"I loved using this app. I enjoy using the step goals (plus global challenges), calorie counter, pulse monitor and many more features of the app. I recently experienced an issue where the app locked out stating that it wouldn't work with a rooted phone. I have never rooted my phone. I emailed and got a reply, that's nice, recommending uninstall and reinstall (didn't fix it) and to check if my system was rooted. Somehow after multiple reinstalls and reboots it works.. but how reliable will it be?"
"The app was nice, but the main benefit was convenience. It doesn't have any special features or anything. It recently started asking to allow phone permission, and prevented me from accessing the app without using a new sign-in feature. I don't take this app so seriously as to require two-factor authentication, it feels excessive. The inconvenience is significant enough that I uninstalled the app entirely. There are many apps that do the same thing without the added troubles."
"I've been using this app for a few years, never had an issue until it updated I guess, and I've had my runs screwed 3 times in 2 weeks. It doesn't time my distance correctly. I'm a runner and I've been running the same path for over 4 years now and lately it doesn't calculate correctly and that messes up my time. Just today, my regular 1km showed that it was 400m only. Not impressed one bit."
"It's a good app, however, it would be better if it would sync/connect to Fitbit devices. The Samsung app/phone is not accurate in my step counts. For example Fitbit which has my stride measured and GPS says 11k steps where the Samsung which does not have the measure stride says 9k. Disappointing in the accuracy so please get the ability to sync to Fitbit devices as I will not be having my arm covered in hundreds of tracking devices."
"Ever since the 2023 update, when the month ends, you can't see the previous days of the month. The system just hangs and spins and only shows today's data. This is the second month it happened. Can this be fixed? I can't see how many calories I burned yesterday and that's a problem for me and keeping my weight under control."
"For every single workout started in my watch 5 Pro, I need to 'disagree' to share my location with the weather app! No option to disagree forever or disable this! Impossible to see your steps statistics for a specific month! You can only see in 7, 31 day periods from the current day. The kcal count from the registered workouts doesn't match the value of 'activity kcal' in the daily activity menu! Can't manually stop auto recorded workouts, need to wait until they timeout!"
Very frustrating to see that the heart rate monitor was removed from this app since last time I used it. Spent the last 15 minutes entering my password a million times and setting up 2FA three or four times because it somehow just didn't register and even went to view and Chrome and everything... Eventually it just allowed me to continue? Only to find that the feature I got this for doesn't exist so I'm uninstalling.
The app doesn't work. It doesn't record anything or sync with Fitbit or Google Fit. I even had the settings set up correctly to sync but the only way to record any stats is to manually enter them. Seriously needs a lot of work.
"I love this app but there should be more things to track on this app especially if you have certain medical issues. I know one of my friends has the apple phone and there health tracker has everything plus more such as symptoms, eating habits such as if u eat or not, brushing teeth, tracking your bowel moments/bathroom and many more."
"I was using this app for pace counting as nothing else is left in this app which is productive. Over and above the complaint/ review is answered by AI generated message so the customer experience goes out of the window. Previously, it had option to monitor oxygen level, that is gone. Now they are asking phone number for üëé""greater customer experience"" which i don't want to give. It is nothing else but data harvesting, lateron, they will bring an other update asking permission to share personal."
"Samdung is abusive and the apps annoying. EVERY Samsung app I've tried to use eventually is downgraded, functions poorly and has functions removed that we once enjoyed. The number of locked down apps that are no longer functional within the 1st year on this phone and previous Android and inability to keep them functional is why I'll never buy another Android or Samdung product. You have alienated customers for too long! Goodbye!"
I like it but sometimes it doesn't recognize when I stop working out and I get in my car and drove off
"Not loading with oppo phone. Tried everything. Deleted cache, restarted phone and reinstalled the app. It refuses to work. Update. Samsung have given me a number to contact to address the problem that doesn't work. I am in the UK Update. Contacted Samsung, they basically told me as I'm not using a Samsung phone there is nothing they can do. ( Even though it is a Samsung app that is not working, and they have a specific app to allow the watch to be used on other android devices). Awfull"
"I use Cronometer to log calories and I think the integration is great but the food diary needs to be imported to samsung health. I've found that cronometers platform is much easier to use and has a better range of foods, + I've got all my recipes set up in cronometer and it is a very laborious job trying to make them again in this app. I would love this to become apart of the syncing, it is the only element missing from my Samsung health account."
"My Samsung S10 got an update today. Went for a run a few hours after and S Health keeps pausing mid run and does not resume by itself. Even after Ianually resume, pauses again. The GPS also seems to not record the distance I run. Rhythm completely upset and this completely put me off. I can only gauge how much I've run based on my step count. Please sort this out ASAP."
"The app is ok but on my S9+ however auto tracked walking or running does not show route on map, just shows a rough circular area and distance is inaccurate. Location information is on with Location as high accuracy. Explicitly tracked running or walking works and the route is shown. When using runkeeper at the same time as an auto tracked session, runkeeper shows the route but Samsung health does not. Would be thinking of buying a Samsung galaxy watch but not so sure until this is fixed."
"This app gets worse instead of better! When you removed weight management, as that was important to me, I was forced to move over to use my fitness pal... Which was working great syncing steps from SH to MFP. But in this last update, steps do not sync anymore between them both... If this carrys on, I won't be buying anything Samsung again, including updating my gear s3... Its like you are deliberately changing things to try and force people to buy your products, and your products alone!!.."
"This app is awesome and it helps me track all my health data. Sync well with my smart watch too. The app gives a lot of information and exercise ideas. reason I'm giving 4 Star is because the app does not give me aggregated data over a period, it only gives average values beyond 1 day. For instance I would want to know my total number of steps for say the last 7 days, 1 month etc or the total km for same period. But the app does not have these options, it only gives you average. Else its awesome"
"Absolute garbage !!! Like most people are saying, this used to a be a great app and I used it alot. However, I've been trying to get past the new privacy settings but it doesn't tell you what your supposed to change. I have changed EVERYTHING and still can't past the screen. And before Samsung come back with a patronising generic reaponse saying to contact them I've already done that and did everything they said. I don't know what you've done Samsung but you've seriously screwed this one up."
"Updating my review, well downgrading to 1 star after the update. You can no longer see monthly step totals or averages, its all done rolling depending on whats on the screen... if you used the app before then you would know what I mean and how stupid it is now. Old Good app but rating 2 stars because of the blatant cheating/bot accounts that ruin the step challenges. Some 'walk' the equivalent of 2 steps per second of every minute in the month. Needs to be sorted out to stop skewing the numbers"
"Samsung forces you to run this app in the background to use with your fitbit, if you want to change settings, for example adjusting how frequently to measure your heart rate. The samsung health app keeps turning on and runs in the background using up battery life as soon as Bluetooth is turned on. If you delete the app your fitbit will return to the default settings and every now and again will remind you with a annoying message that eveything has been rest because you uninstalled the app."
Everything has been great up until today where my galaxy Fit (e) and the app couldn't sync so I restarted both which didn't work either. So I went back to a previous version thinking it was the new version of the Samsung Health app and that didn't work either and I've now lost all my data ‚òπ Now they've changed the app so you can't see weight lost since last weight logged which I found really helpful and the redesign to be honest is rubbish. Next upgrade won't be a Samsung.
"They just removed the ability to see HR tracking as a continuous line instead of a useless max/min chart. It doesn't sound like much but it is a change that affects how I use the app on a daily basis. Apparently it is because the Galaxy Watch 4 has been a poor performer leaving large gaps on continuous HR chart. So they nerfed the app to instead of fixing the problems (which I had never even experienced). Please, Samsung, add more features instead of removing useful ones!!"
"I cannot login. Have tried multiple times. Searched for ways to log in and apparently there use to be an option to skip which I don't have. Also, people have written that other phones that aren't Samsung will not allow the app to work. Very disappointed to have this smart watch and not being able to use it to it's full potential."
"It's very uncomfortable to find weight notes after the last update. I have a long history of measurements and sometimes it's important to find month and year of record quickly. Another unfriendly part - weight is an average measure. Please, roll back automatic weight calculations. New menu looks nice."
"Great app, however the food database is extremely poor, no way of scanning foods? so you're better off using another app to record food and water intake and hope for the best the information will sync between the apps successfully. It'd also be good if apart from weight you could add body measurements in order to find your total body fat component. Overall it's a good app, but it lacks on many other features which are available with other apps out there."
Quite good app. The step tracking is okay and i enjoy the challenges (altough they are easy to cheat on). Sleep track could have a feature of wake up window so based on my heart rate it would wake me up in the most suitable time. I love the fitness programs BUT i would welcome a possibility to save or favourite the programs for later finishing. Also it would be nice to be able to do it with my in app friends. Not enough recipes. Maybe consider adding mealplans like fitness plans.
"was a great app, recent updates have removed some features like the SPo2 meter, and made it think I have a different wearable (S2 instead of my s3) now I can't see certain info saved by the Gear! Also now inundated with ads, which by the way hide the settings and updates icons at the top right of the screen! Might be time to switch to Apple!"
All is well but steps counting should be shown on the lock screen
"Prior to the new update I loved the app. I'm disappointed that the weight trends have gone. They were useful and I really miss being able to track my progress in a table, rather than having to slide back and fore to compare days/months. Please change it back!"
"The application turns itself off immediately after starting. I have already tried everything, reset, uninstall - nothing helps. The application at the time of downloading data from the watch - that is, immediately after turning on itself turns off. In 9 out of 10 startup cases, the device switches itself off. You can't use it !!! I tried sto, clear chache, reinstall - it doesnt help. EDIT After quite long time and few updates problem is still on board. Reset phone, watch didnt help. Looking for answer in Google and lot of people has this issue. C'mon Samsung - repair Your APPs."
"The ruining screen switches back to the clock face, depending on how long I set the screen timeout. Rightfully, the running app should stay on until the run is completed. A runner needs to constantly monitor his / her running stats, and not get frustrated with the display."
"Great app but would love a better interface for manually adding workout info (eg. sets/reps of pushups or squats). Would also love to make more prominent use of the 'trends' graphs. For example, it would be great to be able to set the main portion of my homepage to be a daily/weekly/monthly view of multiple excercises - a green line for pushups, red for squats, blue for crunches. That would make it much easier and faster to get a quick overview of how many reps of each you were averaging a week!"
"Its been such a helpful tool towards achieving my health improvement goals - I am pushed by both the friendly and global challenges. Now I can see and also feel the positive impact on my health. I know when I get adequate sleep, so I don't need the sleep record. Also, my meal combinations cant be found on the app but the step counts, active time/exercise and other records are excellent."
Items should have option to be a tile in a grid or double tile width or triple or quadruple width etc. Grids should be increased to have more than just 3 across for those with good eyesight and want an overview of more. Allow up to 7 across even. Major backwardness in just having one tile across and no options for more. Exercise tracking should tell how many total steps were walked or ran for each period detected instead of just pace and distance etc.
"I can't score it in negative or zero. Saying that the recent update has looked like a sham would be an understatement. The app is highly glitchy since the update and fails to perform on more than one occasion consistently. Performance aside, the synchronization of steps which should be seamless between my fitness band and app goes into cryosleep ever so often, completely messing up my exercise and workout data that I use as feedback. This is unabashedly shameful for a multinational company."
The app worked well until last update. After that it started loosing track of steps. My activity level did not decrease but the actual recording hardly shows a daily goal of 6000 steps. I run every day for an hour and keep on carrying device with me wherever i go so the distance walked used to be around 10-15 km (including daily run). But now it looks like i went from a busy bee to a pile of lazy bones.
"I'vr given up on this totally. Doesn't measure distance walked, despite doing its 3-2-1 start, so its a total waste of space! I loved this app. The new version is a waste of space. It says 40 mins active time, 7000 steps, nothing on map and only 0.2 miles walked. How does that work! Not good enough Samsung. You've spoiled what was a very user friendly app üòï"
"This app goes from bad to worse! Still doesn't always record heart rate data against exercise despite having the data as it shows in trends. Takes forever to sync to my Samsung watch, galaxy wearable syncs straight away. Updated today and now can't use at all as now have to log I with a Samsung account that I don't have and don't want. Giving up on this useless app with it's terrible layout that doesn't got on a phone screen (does anyone even test before publishing)."
Cannot edit bad sleep data. There is absolutely no reason for this to not have a provision to edit sleep times without losing all the stage data. Useless and wrong. Doesnt even stop sleep tracking when you turn off bedtime mode on watch & literally get up &walk across the house. Only turns off when you open the app on the phone. My Mobvoi did better and cost less. Other features are OK but their attempts to restrict users to their ecosystem is offensive & annoying. Stop trying to be Apple
"Great for the most part, but lacking in some areas. This app is easy to use, fun, and helped me loose weight. It's my favorite health app. However I wish you could scan barcodes and create recipes in this app. I also wish there were more Workout routines and maybe some recipes. It would also be cool to have more information about calories burned"
"I have increased my rating from 4 to 5 stars given the excellent support service. My biking records showed in the menu 92 times of my reaching 100 km, but when accessing it, ot showed much less. The support service was hugely helpful, pleasant to talk to, and never have I felt that they were rushing it with the issue I was having."
"I find this app pretty good to use, but there are a few elements that can be improve. It'd be great if you could start an activity on your phone and watch your progress in real time on your s gear watch, or if you could customise the challenges between friends and not just the generic step challenge. Additionally, I feel there is a lack of men's health elements on the app for example links to mental health apps or testicular/prostate cancer awareness, you know things like that."
"The latest update made this app absolutely pointless for me. Removing the calories consumed vs burned tracker, and being able to tailor it to a weight loss goal was fantastic. To get around this I uninstalled the app, found the APK of an older version, reinstalled it and disabled auto update. Recommend others do the same."
I did really like the app but I'm not a fan of the last upgrade. I use it to track my running and the pace per mile it quotes is now totally off. Today I was on 2 miles at about 18 minutes so the pace around a 9 minute mile but it said 20 minutes! At least the actual time elapsed and the total estimated time were still accurate. But pace is important to me so I might need to start using another app if it stays doing this.
"This App does not work in my phone. Automatic step counting does not work in background. Even if you keep app opened while work-out/walking or running it shows wrong count and stops frequently. My google fit works seemlessly perfect and it can't even read data from Google Fit. Therefore, it is useless App for me considering fitness tracker. Diet monitoring is good but that too does not show correct data most often and does not show items that i ate and recorded in the App."
"It is a very complete app with exercise, sleep, water and even food tracking. It also motivates you through monthly challenges and badges you can achieve. It also has workout routines that are great. The only con I can think of is its inability to connect and sync data to other apps like bodbot, Google fit, noom etc"
"Good but not quite there for me. I'd like the workouts to be editable for example I'd like to be able to record a distance to my Elliptical trainer workouts rather than just writing it as a note, I'd also like to be able to edit 'other workout', so I can easily see what the workout was ie butt, arms without having to scroll down to the notes."
"The app auto stops when I start running almost always stops around 0.4 kms. For weeks now, even took it to Samsung, they couldn't help. Even map wont record. So it's not really useful when running. It records all the steps perfectly when walking, gives blood pressure reading accurately but the one function I need from it is malfunctioning."
"This app is boring. It has everything you need but it is not visually appealing. Could use more visual stuff, graphs, imagery, etc. Also wish there was a way to ""merge"" auto-tracked activities. For example my walk yesterday tracked in 4 seperate bubbles and is hard to see how far/long I walked without breaking out a calculator."
"Terrible update! Lost the best feature, the weight and calorie management feature with the targets. The fact it triangulated my calorie intake, with my calories burnt and weight target goals was brilliant and the only reason I used Samsung Health. It was a 5 star app until this feature was removed recently. Please bring it back! It made losing weight so much easier and less stressful!"
"One of the best apps out there for health! But we who don't own any smartwatch feel helpless. Please add water reminders, food reminders, sleep entry reminders without having smartwatch. I have been using this app from a long time but feel really helpless when I forget to record entries in the app. I know one can do this by creating reminders and alarms. But if it will be available inside the app, it'll be much better."
Best fitness app there is especially if you got Galaxy Watch.
The app used to work really well and was extensively used by me. However about 10 days back I was suddenly logged out of the app and since then have done everything possible to log in/sign in but to no avail. Once I enter my log in details the screen goes white with a spinning circle and it is a perpetual wait. Have uninstalled and installed the app number of times but it has not helped. Tried looking for solutions on Samsung support and realised this is a problem many people are encountering.
"Until a month or so ago this app was quite brilliant, notwithstanding certain lacks/flaws, and it was due in large part to the weight management part of this app (now defunct) that allowed me to lose 40+ kilos in only 1 year. Now it's quite useless (ie: removal of weight management) and even annoying (ie: all shades of the same green color for food groups intake) and I am looking elsewhere for a much better program unless Samsung Health fixes those serious issues! Bring back the good bits now!"
"This app became so slow... It is annoying. You want to add 1 glass of water on your tracker and it takes 10 seconds.. no, thank you. You don't have to synchronise everything with the cloud right away. Save some stuff locally. I still use it for counting steps etc. so you get 3 stars."
"New layout is rubbish. I can't see my fastest swim length quickly as it no long shows the bars for time for each lenght. No option to switch between speed and swolf and other settings as before. Most likely, I will ditch this app and not use my watch to track swimming as the information and plain layout is uninspiring, unless it is improved very quickly. Features missing like the lap screen on the watch which shows the counter and laps in the middle...turned a reasonable app into a useless one"
This app is great. It would be better if it tracked sugar and if custom foods could have the gram counter as well.
"Removal of key features makes me look for alternatives! It is so frustrating that both weight management and caffeine tracking have been removed. I have spent lots on both my Samsung phone and galaxy watch, both which may get changed out for an alternative that offers this. Why would you eliminate these features. It makes no sense. Update.... More key features eliminated including how you track weight... Why does Samsung continue to remove functionality?"
"Very glitchy uploading workouts to Strava. I just bought the Samsung fit pro 2 to replace my Tomtom and I'm very frustrated that workouts don't instantly upload to Strava like they do with the Tomtom watch and app. I've connected strava to the health app but lastnights workout still hasn't been sent to Strava. That was nearly 24 hours ago. My run on Friday didn't upload til saturday morning and was cut short by 0.2 km which made my pace inaccurate. What is going on Samsung? This is not good enough. If Tomtom can get it right, so should Samsumg. This sync should be seamless, especially considering the huge following Strava has. If this can't be sorted easily this will be a deal breaker and i will have to return my watch. How do I fix this Samsung??"
"I have used this app for a couple of years and it worked well. Suddenly, it has stopped taking account of my age when calculating heart rate zones. I have reported this to Samsung support (and I see I'm not the only one with this issue) and they have not responded - recent updates have failed to correct the problem."
"Used to be quite reliable, but it's misjudging distances (a 1.5km path i walk twice daily is approximated to anything between 1.02 and 2km), single workout sessions split into several 'independent'sessions, and automatic detection of running vs walking has stopped working completely. Sad, it used to be a nice companion but I guess it's time to find a better workout app."
"Please fix bugs the app keeps changing the calorie target I set for food and is failing to count my steps and record them accurately. I have uninstalled and reinstalled, run updates and when I go back into the app the calorie allowance I have set has changed and I'm unable to get I back to that exact amount. Extremely frustrating and just more reason to switch to another app which is consistent and reliable."
"Like most people I am dissapointed by the latest changes. In food section you bundle together snacks, having them seperate helped diet management. I used the Swaive app included to monitor body temperature that has now been removed with no alternative. Tarting up the look and feel seems to have little overall benefit to something that worked well."
The App does not allow manual input of exercise for when phone or watch are not present. It does not pick up floors... I live in a 2 storey home and work in a 2 storey office but each day it says zero floors. These options are both available on fitbit. I traded a fitbit for Samsung and now am wishing I hadn't. Would also be nice if it would allow you to set stride length as the step counter is inaccurate.
"Doesn't track trademill exercise properly (steps, speed). üòûüò†"
Worked well enough on my S7 but won't work on my new phone - if it's not compatible you shouldn't be able to download it and try to log in. I get to the log in stage and it just loads and loads til it times out. Then I have to reboot the app and try to sign in again just to repeat this process over and over til I decided to uninstall it. The features were good on my S7 and I hate that I can't pull my data across to my new phone.
"its quite annoying if you track your food intake. Adding self prepared meal is unintuitive. The flow should be totally different. First have to create the food, then add ingredients and as a next step to be able to add portions of this food to daily intake. There are missing features like editing food item, sharing food across friends etc. This app needs a total refactoring, involving good UX designers. Guys, the apple perfection is not in the hardware, but in the software! Remember it!"
"Have a new phone. Everything synced. Great, BUT why have a step counter that doesn't work? By now, average day, I've done 6000 steps. It's recorded 1000. I've definitely done more. Even sat here shaking it, nothing happens. I've tried what has been suggested to others to resolve this without success. Does this signal the end of me using Samsung Health? Looks like it. Also doesn't have half the food on that's needed to record meals. Shame. Liked the competitions but pointless if steps not counted"
"This app is quite accurate and consistent with the step count but I am very disappointed that it only records 30 days activity. An older version I had in my old Samsung galaxy note 3 kept years of activity data and I liked that a lot! Developer, can you do something about it? It is really important for me to be able to look back and see how I have improved or declined over a year or even more."
"The idea is good, but it has some features that are hard to work with. For instance, if I want to record a workout I have to remember to put the start when I start and stop it when I finish. if I forget to stop it, the counter continues until I do. There is no way to edit that. You either erase the workout and don't have it or leave it there wrong. Also it doesn't give the option of add new activities that are not part of the app. So I have uninstalled it and use Google Fit instead."
"good app overall and they've improved the ""together"" feature. If I could make a suggestion it would be to be able to pick and choose the nutrients to track in the food tracking area. Currently it tracks and scores you on the top nutrients and vitamins (fiber, protein, fat, vitamin c, calcium, iron) but some people would like the option to track and focus on other nutrients. Example: vitamin D. It isn't even listed in the nutrient profile and so you can't see if u met your daily quota."
"Women's health is broken, you send me a notification about not working backups women's health data. But now looks like woman's calendar is broken too :("
"I'd give it 5 stars for the previous version, the food count and the details were more accurate and easier to access, with more information. Now you need to fish what each of the meals specifically contains, plus there is no carbs chart,and the protein one is missing half of the stuff but still they're added in the total. I said to my self ill give it some time, maybe because it's new, but unfortunately it wasn't the case. It can be improved."
"App was really good till last June. After June, all of a sudden, I am unable to sync/ backup my Samsung Health data with my Samsung account. Suggestions provided by the technical team to clear the cache & to update the app doesn't help to sync. Waiting for the support team to provide a solution to sync the health data. If I have to reinstall the app, I may loose all the saved data."
"The app used to work more or less fine (the map was sometimes wild). I only used step counter and walking tracker because I am not fanatic about keeping records of everything. For this reason I don't need high security for the app. I had to delete it because two step verification is now compulsory, but i think it should be optional for those who need it. I don't."
"I like the app a lot with constant good updates it becomes better and better with more features and with increased depth to informations to be analyzed. Im giving 3 stars, this way I hope at least the developing team will consider my request/advice for a feature. I like counting water intake since sometimes I fall in the habit of not drinking enough water a day. However, I feel the lack of feature to set the app to send e.g. hourly reminder to drink, like another app ""water intake reminder""."
"This app is good but not great since the latest update Samsung don't seem to want to share the data with 3rd party apps, having a right mare with trying to sync with UA apps especially My fitness Pal not syncing the steps I've done in the day. Don't know if it's Samsung being funny or just a bug if so please get it sorted asap people like myself will have to go elsewhere if it's not sorted which is a shame as I did like it and love my Gear S3 Frontier but if it's not going to work it's useless. I've been kind with 3 stars considering the amount of time I've spent and researched to try and get it to work."
"I like the clean interface of the Health app. I use it with a Galaxy Watch. But it have 3 missing features I would really like to see. 1) Finished workouts cannot be trimmed/cropped. It is frustrating if I forgot to finish it on time. (Major for me) 2) Workout detection is great, but it would be much better if there would be an option to use precise gps positions during these. (Can live without.) 3) Google Fit integration is missing, and needs 3rd party apps.. (On android this is strange)"
"I like this and using this for long time, a lot of options, quite useful......but in last 2 weeks I don't trust it as much as I did before. I started running and it doesn't count properly my kilometres. I counted my distance by Google Maps- totally different number..... Then I did my workout with different app and it was 3k difference between 2 apps, the same workout- different numbers. I'm really disappointed as results of my workout is important for me."
"Perfect app for beginners. I enjoyed programs a lot. I also bought a smartband and (when I broke it) a smartwatch, then a smart scale and it works seamlessly. I'm at 88 kg at 1.8 m. I started just to keep track of myself and after 6 months I decided to give it a go for weight loss. Even if it doesn't work I enjoy it a lot."
Please bring the weight management feature back. It was what I liked the most about your app. This latest update became hugely unnecessary for me especially if you take out the weight management feature. Please bring it back. It's hard to find such a feature on other apps. This helps me with my weight loss journey so much
"Have used this app for years and LOVED it. Now you remove the weight management tool, and I read online that you're also planning on removing features like caffeine and food tracking? If that happens, I will completely stop using it. As is, I'm already going to stop looking into purchasing a Galaxy Watch to sync with it. Also edited to add that with the new colour scheme, you can barely tell the difference between the macros when looking at the food intake section. Just bad."
"Great app for tracking my effort, it really helps me on the motivation side of things and allowed me to lose a few kilos already. One thing however : it is frustrating not to be able to edit (or at least report) obviously flawed records from a Galaxy Watch activity (i.e. swimming splits), and you'll truly deserve the 5th star the day I am able to do so in the app."
"The latest update took away one of (if not the most) important feature‚Äîweight management. If you were familiar with it before its disappearance you can still mentally subtract the calories, but personally I haven't used the app since the update. Other features still work, but the latest update was unnecessary. It was a perfectly good app"
"I can't even log in. I just set up my Galaxy Active2 today, downloaded the Samsung Health app, enter my log in details, then I just get the loading spinners. Not a great first impression, very dissatisfied. Looks like there's a few people with the same issue. Edited to say: I already tried those things suggested. Still doesn't work, what's phoning that number going to achieve? The app either works or it doesn't."
"There is a lagging in the walking steps counter it's the fourth day of being wrong steps. We need more and more features, like fasting tracker and logging food offline. Maybe new features of your own way too"
"Something seems to be happening with the sleep monitoring in app. Couple of days ago app showed 10 steps, right after I opened my eyes and was still in bed. Yesterday, it cut and partly erased my sleep record after I rated the sleep. The after I synced again, the record was showing correct amount of total sleep but shifted 4 hours ahead. Today it synced correctly at first but now the sleep is shifted one hour ahead on the mobile, but showed correctly on the watch."
"Stopped counting steps, Using app for years, and won't replace it, however in the last weekS it stopped counting steps. Did everything ppssible from actually walking, cache clear to reinstall and nothing.... Why?"
"I used this app on my old phone and even on there it didn't work every time. Now I switched to a new OS on my phone and it is literally impossible to use. The sign in process simply does not ever complete. It's just loading for ages. Edit: I already tried clearing cache, force stopping and reinstalling the app and restarting my phone even before the reply of the developer and it changed nothing."
"Hi! I really like this app! I think Samsungs stuff are the best! That's one thing that's really annoying me. It's abt the end of running! It's normal that we run a little bit more meters plus our goal to slow down before stop for good, but I don't wanna this on my records! I know the app will record anyway and that's ok! The problem is that I can't edit the runner to erase this final part and the pace goes crazy! I don't wanna 10,4Km.. 5,56Km.. I wanna edit to 10Km.. 5Km.. and see my real pace!"
"Clean UI, but TERRIBLE UX... As a UX/UI designer, this app is EXTREMELY frustrating to deal with... can't edit or delete workouts, can't skip an exercise to do later, can't save program workout because it conflicts with itself, can't customise macros, can't set step count to only be from wearable so count is doubled, and in general the app is missing other important features and is difficult to navigate and understand. Sadly I'm stuck with it now that I have Samsung Watch Active üò°"
"This app is so unituitive. Since July I haven't been able to figure out how to read my heart rate using my S21 Ultra. I've looked in every nook & cranny, even followed online steps. My ""measure"" button simply doesn't exist."
"Est. 500 MIL diabetics globally. Samsung health has 9 diabetic compatible accessories: 7 not U.S. prescribed/health insurance covered, remaining 2 are Accu-Check glucometers. Dexcom ""CGM"" is highly accurate & available in many countries. Effectively helps determine insulin needs, provides predictive trending data w/ alerts to prevent hypo & hyperglycemic events, and paired w/ compatible pump creates an automated insulin delivery system. Dexcom integration is a global need! Thx"
"Bad permissions. Earlier versions didn't require access to samsung account or to manage phone calls. I monitor my health for myself, not to share. Make it optional!"
"Wants access to all your contacts, and will not work if you do not agree to provide the permission. I purchased the watch and it should work without a need to know my contacts. This is very disappointing from Samsung"
Another disappointing outing for Samsung. This app still doesn't offer support for Android 13. App will not record certain data types any longer though all required permissions have been allowed. Time to give WearOS another go.
Required to sync contacts? My app just updated and is REQUIRING permission to my phone and contacts. This Should be optional! I don't care about challenges with my contacts and I'm sketchy about what can my contacts see. Can't I just stay private!?!
"12/30 my sleep is6 hours off and so are my steps (bc the time of off.) Did a ton!!! Of troubleshooting an told to wait a few days. Did that, called on 12/2 as not resolved. Issue has been escalated with Samsung. Was told they call me in a week 12/15 noone called me as they said they would. I called back. Did TS yet again. called back and entire record of conversation is gone! Super pissed! Highly disappointed in Samsung. Fix this! Yall keep telling me to call, but when I do, yall transfer me"
"It's very nice app, the only thing missed is gym exercise program, search engine for the exercises & to be able to add my own GYM work out schedule. Everything else is great."
Fitness not tracking. I'm 22 minutes into training to run 5k on the fitness section and it's been stuck on warm up for 22mins. Workout is 30mins marks it incomplete or missed yet I did it but it's stuck on Warmup the past 2 days I've tried and completed but fitness shows not completed cause it's on warm up for 30mins
Since the update on 10/12/22 my watch wont sync to my phone anymore. It thinks its attached to a different phone. It was working great before the update. It was a 4 star before that
"It's perfect, but I would really appreciate it if I could use ECG and blood pressure measuring features on my watch. I think it's not fair just cause I live in Iran I can't use all the feature of my watch even when I payed for it like everyone else on this planet."
"Extremely inaccurate and it appears that Samsung deleted my complaint about the inaccuracies of this app. They don't like you to criticize their watch and app. Since my original post about the inaccuracies they not only deleted my comments but have now infact, directly gone into the app and phone to make it more inaccurate than ever. I'm a disabled man who has difficulty walking. I usually take about 200 steps a day but now they are showing I took 9,755 steps. Impossible! Avoid these liars!"
"Sleep mode doesn't activate at times specified, deleted app and re issued but still does not function, alerts still come through, no grey scale unless I manually set it, unfunctional if you want a good night sleep üò¥"
"Lost all my data, despite the app and my watch saying it was backed up, after getting after Error 5107 and uninstalling/reinstalling. Over 2 years of data gone."
As of today the app is using 22% ofy battery...its never above 10...phones been idle most the day... Never have I had this bad of battery life on mg device...using 10% more than my next app and its just in the background... I do have a Watch but its never been this bad... Edit: fixed via update.
"It's good but when walking the audio will not tell me at .5 miles, or 1.5 miles,or 1.5 miles etc. It will only tell me at 1,2,3miles etc. This used to work and tell me at every .5 miles. Please fix this. Thanks"
I've been unable to edit sleep time since the format changed from a slider to digital clock. Love this app when I can edit the sleep time.
"As a trans person with dysphoria I think changing ""Women's Health"" to ""Period Health/Tracker"" or something similar would be a little more inclusive and hopefully a simple change! Other than that, great app!! üòÅ"
"My main purpose buying a galaxy watch was to get high/low heart rate notifications. The watch gives a notification, but not the app. So there's no way to trigger IFTTT and get help üëé"
"Nearly impossible to measure body composition with my watch. Multiple attempts with watch positioned exactly where pictured, keep receiving error messages.....useless...."
How soon till u r compatible with Wyze scales? Is there any plan to do so? Also u need to be able to edit sleep time. Just because I'm watching TV in bed with my cat doesn't mean I'm sleeping. I was able to (in app) on the $30 tracker I use to wear. Y can't my $200 Samsung watch do the same in app? Do each thing & u will get the last 2 stars.
"When trying to open the app on my Pixel 7 Pro, I get an error that my SIM card is not detected (I definitely have an activated SIM) and I cannot proceed any further. Will update my rating once resolved."
"My older smartwatch was slowly dying and I wanted one with spo2 capabilities so I bought a refurbished Galaxy watch 4. Spo2 isn't there, the widget isn't there. About ready to send it back."
The stress app doesn't work on my Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra. Work on my Note 8. What happened? Thus App was a 5+ Will change rating when I get an answer and this functionality returns. Would like to see a cycling competition like you have for the steps challenges.
"After years of using this app it has suddenly stop allowing me to record weight, its important that I do this regularly as its a record for my hospital appointments. Disappointing after its worked so well for years"
Help needed. I have two Samsung accounts and have signed in to the wrong one on my new phone. The app automatically signs me into the wrong account even when uninstalled and reinstalled.
"I'm one of those people that has a Samsung phone and watch, therefore will only use the Samsung apps for tracking my runs/walks etc. I love seeing the map and how it encourages me to keep going'."
I just purchased the Samsung Galaxy Watch 5. Love the watch and features but am very disappointed that I am not able to access the ECG or Blood Pressure features. I have tried to download the app for it to my phone but there is no available app to download. Very disappointed
"Version 6.22.1.053 is draining battery on Pixel 6 PRO about 1% per hour. Fix please ASAP!!! Update: Pixel 6 PRO, Android 13, new SH Version 6.22.2.007 is not fixed. The battery drain issue still here. Shame on You Samsung! Update: Battery draining issue is fixed in Version 6.22.5.039. Thanks."
I like my Galaxy Watch 3 but I cannot for the life of me get the nocturnal oxymeter to function. I have it enabled and it has never managed to work. I have OSA so this would be an incredibly valuable feature... If it worked.
"Wish it had some options for workouts such as ""gardening, raking"", or even ""other"". Some of us have to burn calories other ways, but still want to track."
"Well I bought this Samsung pro 5 watch and it told me to use Samsung health to keep a record or monitor your health and lifestyle. But the app does not want to log me in it keeps circling back to login Home page. Do I have a Samsung account ""yes I do"". Why is it being stubborn as a mule I have no idea. Would love to try this app but right now I'm giving it a one star since this app won't play nice."
"Dear Samsung team, I'm unable to see my step count even after trying multiple option and fixing them. Initially it was good and working properly and now step count was not recording in this. Kindly update me on this"
"It's a great app. Everything is working, but the sleep tracking has stopped working on my Galaxy Smartwatch Pro 5, which i wear all the time. Pls fix it."
"Updated yesterday from Galaxy Store, Walking exercise didn't updated Steps count! Look in this chaos! Giving options for Pause/start/stop steps in Notification or in menu while long pressing the app icon isn't a good idea ?"
My wife and I can NEVER get into this app anymore!! We use it all the time but now it's wanting a two step verification that NEVER works. We have tried and tried! Please fix this issue.
"Is have been working properly until 3 days ago, when the date has changed and is not syncing the right date with my Samsung Galaxy watch. Is registering wrong moment of training. I can't fix it on settings! Please help."
You've completely destroyed this application. It was pretty cool but now it's very difficult to navigate. All I want to do is measure my O2 stats and it's taken me an hour of web research and I still haven't read my O2 stats
"Doesn't always sync to Health Connect, it only does it during workouts so it misses sending the rest of the data to other fitness apps."
"This app doesn't work well at times. It's accuracy is not always correct, plus it has trouble communicating with my Galaxy 5 wrist watch!!"
"I used to have a Samsung galaxy 9. I was able to take a reading of my heart rate and my stress level. I recently got a Samsung 22 ultra. Now I can not do either one. Is this feature not available on this phone, or do I have to download something else?"
Since upgrading to the s22 this app is abysmal. The GPS is out by at least 300m per km - with my average km time blowing out by a minute and speed reducing by a km - and is unable to correctly map the route.
It now onky works with a samsung watch. Last time i bought a Samsung phone as i dont want to be forced as a consumer to buy an item to continue with a app that would and should still work without the need to purchase the watch.
You told me to contact you. Should you not be able to just fix the app... It is not fixing itself it is getting worse. After the last update it is not working properly. 10 seconds to G... And all voice directions seem to be messed up
It's a good app and it works with keeping track of your steps. I like joining the challenges but I hate getting kicked when others don't but hey life can't always be fair right?
I hate this app. Somehow it's on my phone and no matter what I do I can't get rid of it. It pops up whenever it wants to and always gets in my way. I really wish Samsung had not put this on my phone without giving me away to get rid of it. Totally useless for me.
"Since upgrading my Android device, I can't access the heart monitor, stress tracker, or anything else I could before I upgraded. Any reason why? Have those features been removed for device upgrades, or do you have to pay for those now?"
"Sleep detection is a bit off sometimes, but more importantly since the last update I can't edit sleep. Tried uninstall and reinstall, but it's still the same."
"Features removed. Useless & wasting space. It was helpful to have a pulse ox & HR monitor at your fingertip. S22 Ultra has nothing. Worst ""enhancement"" ever!"
Cheater Centric. This app allows for people to cheat way too easy which makes the monthly challenges absolutely pointless for those that are genuine. I'd suggest downloading a different fitness app the doesn't allow blatant cheating.
This app used to be awesome.. I just got a brand new phone I downloaded it went into the app and it's asking me for all sorts of personal information that I never had to do before so this app has certainly changed and I think it sucks now.
"Glitchy. Generally OK, but has sporadic issues where it doesn't recorded activity correctly, which is frustrating."
Can't at all sync to Health Connect. This is the only app I have that doesn't write any data to Health Connect although I gave it permission to do so. Google Fit and Sleep as Android work flawlessly.
Trying to use app for personal application but it is forcing me to allow access to phone so the app can connect to other users. I cannot use it without this unnecessary permission and I refuse to allow it. Shame
"Last update introduced new bugs and removed features. No Samsung, I'm not calling you and wasting my time for nothing, you're going to pay me for your s/w testing, I charge $175pmh for that service. Last Samsung phone I will purchase."
"I would Like to see a bar code scanner for entering food, also some brands aren't in the database. They are more obscure brands and I can usually find something similar."
"Some parts of app doesnt work; Heart rate and blood oxygen. Otherwise, it aids in tracking vitals, exercise and food. I don't own Samsung watch"
Has been great until this last update. Tracker pauses during the workout and doesn't accurate time it correctly or track my distance.
"Why can't I show more than three exercises? This app does many things but, I'm restricted to selecting 3 exercises. If people are doing more than 3 exercises, shouldn't they be able to select as many as they want? Why the restrictions?"
"I am using it in my MI Android phone and it's not working properly as it doesn't run automatically while doing any physical activity, I have to constantly look whether it is working or not, the navigation also seems to be not working while running or cycling properly"
"Works great with my s20 phone and watch series 4. I can't seem to detect snoring data, although my permissions are setup."
The app is no longer syncing. I just tried to switch devices and my recent activity won't upload. This is crazy
I've been using this app for quite a while but recently it's not showing my last weight input. I've noticed a few reviewers saying the same thing. This started from the last update? What's happened?
The watch is no longer tracking minutes of exercise and calories burnt properly. Its shows on my phone but not on my watch and is not recording my activity properly at all and I no longer get full hearts on my watch when I did on my phone.
Tried using the Google login option. Stuck in a loop trying to login. Cleared cache and restarted phone but same issue persists. Unable to manually create a Samsung account now because I already selected my Google account login.
"Watch is mistakingly counting steps during exercise, I set my watch to ""exercise bike"" for 90 minutes, it counted 3000 steps during the same time period. Please fix this bug and disable step counter during workouts."
Terrible experience Steps are continue to count even if you are on bike or in car may be due to road conditions but cant detect that an normal Individual cant run with a speed of 60-70 kmph. Bought samsung due to brand image but proved wrong.
"Each upgrade makes app less stable. Settings change behind the scenes, and can't be reset."
No longer works for recording walking as exercise. Edit: 1 year later still not working properly. Step counting totally unreliable.
"I hope the developer can create dynamic tracking like relive to share workout progress on social media. I hope the developer also add in target heart rate zone while workout. So, the user can monitor the heart rate to control intensity of workouts."
"BPM doesn't work half the time since recent update, which means my exercise doesn't count. I basically have to reset my watch almost daily!! Not ideal"
This app has been great for years. This last week or so it's been inaccurately monitoring miles causing me to have to go back to track instead of walking the way I enjoyüò®
They limit your manual data input. And the caloric calculations don't add up. Could be better.
I use app all the time. Recently when using running mode without set goals the app stopped reporting average pace and total time at every 1km. It used to do this. How to get it back?
This is a must have app of you all bout fitness or even thinking about getting fit. Helps n guides you to set up a routine and count your calorie/water intake. Videos on workouts are the best part. Simple app
The older versions much better if you don't own a smart watch individual action stress oxygen reading its waste off time please go back so every one can use it
Poor experience with non Samsung mobiles. Now I chnaged my phone from samsung to different phone. I m unable to continue use as I have the history records in this app. Pleaee fix this to use in other mobiles.
"App was working great, however after latest update the time is way off and not syncing to the time set on my phone and I can't seem to get it changed"
This is not a five star because shealth on my Galaxy watch is showing 31 minutes of my walk in aerobic zone and my phone is showing 31 minutes in the weight control zone. There is an error here somewhere.
"Great app it keeps track of all my steps and let's me know once I've gone passed my goal of 5,000 steps and let's me know how many calories I've brunt. Great app I would recommend just to keep track of your health."
"It's a coach all by itself, self motivating and enabling you meet your targets. Also love all the nutrients info already available for as many foods as possible. I love it üòç"
Very good however I wish I could download the data to my laptop. This would allow me to review the data easier but more importantly allow me to share the data with my doctor
"Google log in does not work. Text and phone call verification codes never arrive and app said it ""blocked"" my Google account as a result. I am not creating an entire Samsung Account just to count my steps. Uninstalled"
Active 2 not working for ECG. I have the updated software and the apps downloaded but it will not recognize when I touch the button to check. Can you help?
When will the Watch 5 Pro be able to measure blood pressure? We pay for a watch that doesn't even have all of the features enabled without side loading other apps. I expect all features to work on a product I pay for.
Won't update. Dont know why but it just will not update anymore. My device has all the latest updates installed so its puzzling me why this is the only app that refuses to install the latest Samsung Health app.
"Can't change time zone even though time zone in my phone is set to GMT+5:30, samsung health is running on time zone GMT+5:00, which is really irritating. Samsung watch is having correct time zone too. Problem is with Samsung health application and there seems to be no solution right now."
"I have the samsung watch 5 pro and galaxy A53 5G When I try to open the app on phone I receive ""I can't open the app"" if the watch send information on phone it happens again I have uninstalled and redownloaded a lot with no result. Very disapointed"
"I can't even create an account from the phone using my Google info because your app brings me to a 404 error. Since it's in your app, it's not like I could correct anything."
For the love of God please change the water intake to ounces instead of glasses!!! It's a useless water tracker otherwise. Everything else is great.
I have the galaxy fit2. I love it in every way. One important suggestion. Please add distance as a option on the watch faces. How about a monthly distance total in your monthly report?
"It would be great if there was a way to log when we're sick. See data such as how often we're sick, recovery, symptoms, etc."
I'm using the sleep app with my galaxy watch and it is REALLY helping me become more aware of how my waking habits are effecting my sleep quality. I especially like the sleep symbol. It is spot-on for me. Nervous Penguin working toward a higher sleep score!
This application has been the greatest motivation for me to challenge myself to want to do more when it comes to fitness training. I nolonger can't live without it. Thank you Samsung
"Since October 2022 - Shealth Update, Cant Delete or Adjust Incorrect Sleep or Heart Rate, Where Older Version ( Prior Version ) - Could Update and Delete the Correct Sleep, and Heart Rates, this Newer Version needs a Bug Fix, or a Newer Update Version ( ASAP ) - Or How does One Revert back to Older Shealth Version - Jeffrey .. ** Will Make Star Rating Higher, when Newer Update Fixes Problem, as October 2022 Shealth has Bugs/Needs Fixing Done ASAP **"
"App gives incorrect steps, calories and miles. About 3,000 steps off from Google fit app & other podometers. Please fix this problem. Thanks. Uninstalled."
"I have a Galaxy Active 2 watch, a ZFold3 phone and Health 6.22.7.003. Until 12/14/2022, the sleep function worked properly, usually showing me starting sleep around 10pm and waking around 6am. Since 12/14 it shows me starting sleep around 6am and waking around 2am. Both phone and watch show the correct time. What to do?"
"Loved the app. Steps are recorded fine, even though I don't have a Galaxy Watch/Fit synced. Highly recommended!"
"The latest version has taken away the display of my activity compared with all users, and my age group. Was a very good indication of how I was doing."
I love this app but when they updated it the heart rate was changed to an averagr which is way to broad rather than continuous- bring continuous heart rate graph back!
Now whats happened ? As below reviewer - your body composition does not record when you update it ???!!!Not great when you are trying to track !
Mostly steps counting is not accurate because when we are traveling by scooter and motorcycle it shows it as steps. Kindly improve it.
High battery usage. Its using 30% or more per day. My pixel 6 pro is dropping more than 20% overnight while sleeping. Even in restricted mode its still using the battery.
"Inconsistent app. The ""stress"" element only works occasionally which, ironically, raises my stress level. Disappointing app not up to Samsung's standards."
"Requires permission to Phone for the stated purpose ""so that people who have this number in your contacts can find you in Together."" You cannot use the app without granting this permission. There is no need for a health app to require this."
"Hi, I am using galaxy watch 5 pro, with this app in India. It is working perfectly. But the purpose of buying galaxy watch 5 pro is not achieved. As I am not able to use ""Samsung health monitor app"", due to which unable to use feature like ECG, BP tools. So please can you let us know when ""Samsung health monitor app"" will be available in India. Thanks"
"Ridiculous that you can't set your own macros. Not everyone fits into Samsung's ""one size fits all"" of such a high carb intake daily. Otherwise, I do like this app."
Honestly use this to monitor sleep but it never works with my Samsung watch. It either says I didn't sleep or doesn't start recording until 3 am. Disappointing!
I could edit the sleep info that the Watch 5 recorded before. Now it's not possible. Taking away features and functionality is ridiculous.
Great app but you should really only count net carbs. I don't eat alot of carbs but the app says I'm eating more than I do because it's counting all carbs and not just net carbs so it seems like I'm eating more than I actually am.
Have never had a problem with this app until the last update. Now it opens and then force shuts within 2 secs.
"After the recent new update, my Samsung health failed to record my steps. Since 1 November until today 3 November, the steps is still show 0. Any solution or fix it."
Fix the cycling app. It's broken and doesn't record miles correctly. Unusable in current state and breaks my watch.
"App works well. I would appreciate having more fitness options like water aerobics, seated row, chest press lateral raise, etc."
Since I have updated this app and my Samsung watch it has not been recording my sleep. I have the latest updates on both the watch and phone. I have already rebooted the watch and I have restarted the watch and phone as well. What is the problem?
They fixed the bug where it would shift manually inputted sleep times back by an hour. Works fine now!
"There is no way to login as 2FA code not sent from phone or PC logon to Samsung account. Unusable. Watch (Galaxy4 Classic) part works ok, but can't see history on phone. Fail."
"After ""upgading"" in an S22, this app is beyond useless to me. I wish I would have known an ""upgrade"" in hardware was going to strip functionality."
"Its a very good app to track daily activities. One thing lags here, that I can't share activity route with map. Which other apps can easily give."
A bit cludgy and seems to require too much access to my personal data. I do not give a hoot about company privacy policies. It is too damn intrusive.
Love this app. I use it to keep track of blood glucose for my type 2 diabetes. Much easier than using the books that come with the testers.
"A good app. But it annoyingly keeps turning off the connection to strava, which has to be manually turned back on"
I really wish the app counted flights of stairs as I climb 4 flights multiple times a day and really can't keep track of how many times I do it because sometimes I'm just too busy climbing
I've turned on blood oxygen tracking and it still shows no results after almost two weeks of having it enabled.
"Hello, I have a samsung galaxy watch 5 but i can't install samsung health application on xiaomi 12, the error that appears is ""SERVER ERROR OCCURRED.TRY AGAIN LATER.(0X2C#-1#)"" if anyone has any answer to solve this problem please answers. Thank you"
I am trying to sync my data onto the Samsung cloud. Yet it won't sync. Please help. I have tried and tried yet it won't sync
"Ever since last 2 updates have been unable to edit sleep times. Reported this after 1st of last 2 updates, still not working properly. Otherwise good app"
It used to be good. I have observed that the app closes by itself. I have checked the setting if it had a sleep setting. None is there
"I went to upgrade the Step Count as my session had expired, or some such thing, and the app is taking forever to integrate with my Step Count that I have to turn in for work by 11.30. ü§îü§î"
Not synching with the smart watch. The data is always different from watch and the app.
This app is OK but really needs to update the exercises. It is really limited and I do a lot of different workouts. Please sort this out
"UI is informant, lacks in widget. Need more widget for home screen, currently has only one for steps."
"Just got my new S22 Samson. The data transfer went well, but samsung health did not transfeted and now I can't install it on my new cell."
It doesn't track your heart rate. It gives you time period averages. I need to track long term continuous heart rate.
App is buggy; workout programs are out of sync and the language alternates between English and binary ???
Turns out if you no longer have a device that was used to set up this account you can't sign in because the 2FA requires a device you don't have for an account you didn't use.
My Samsung galaxy watch 4 gets worse tracking my heart rate with every update of Samsung health on wear os. Now it is less accurate than the Huawei watch gt 2 pro during strength trying with dumbbells and hiit.
"There is no way to edit incorrect sleep records! I loved Fitbit but am not impressed with this app! I use it mainly to track my sleep. Sometimes it records me as sleeping when I am awake, with no way to edit to show accurate sleep/wake times! In the app you can manually add sleep that has not been recorded by the watch but does not sync the info back to the watch. So watch and app show different records! Galaxy should study Fitbit! Please allow the user to edit incorrectly recorded info!"
"I think this is the most useless app if you do not have a Samsung phone. I have Samsung galaxy watch, which i must say is one of the best watch, but the companion app on non Samsung phone will make you go nuts. The App doesn't sync automatically. When synced, it shows different readings in app, and different on watch. Tried many ways to uninstall, reset, but app remains as dumb as ever. Either the app has bugs or samsung doesn't want thier watch to be used with any other phone than samsung."
Good app but could be better. I get frustrated when recording food as it doesn't always come up. And only remembers what you record for that particular meal not what you've previously had. Recording food could be improved with a scanner option. Most other functions are great.
"I have to agree with the reviews here. I have been using the old version of Samsung Health for years and the new update has broken it for me. For some inexplicable reason, it will only sync with Strava. All the other apps that I had connected with it no longer work (MyFitnessPal etc.). Bizarre design choice."
"I absolutely hate the new update. They deleted all ""connected"" apps. Why? You used to be able to link many different health apps and they would share the information. Samsung I don't want to enter data into multiple apps. Some apps do things much better than you and people have been using them much longer. It is annoying and I'm actually considering deleting the app."
I use it on an off. But it's the security code or captcha that keeps me from using it. It's horrible. I go for months without being logged in. I don't have the best eyesight in the world and it's too difficult for me. It can take me 30 attempts over a period of time. I try it 4/5 time in one go before I get frustrated because I can't make out the text. So then I try it again in another couple of weeks.
"Since I bought a Galaxy Fit Watch (which unfortunately can't be synced with Google Fit) I'm using this app. And I have to admit, I've learned to like it really much. There is one thing I'm missing though: please add 'Spinning' as a workout. I think that 'Exercise Bike' doesn't cover this kind of workout to the point, as Spinning is on a much more intense level. Thanks!"
"Really great app, and also really easy to use. Not to mention, really accurate! Thanks Samsung, for this amazing app, even allowing me to improve in every sport that i partake in, giving accurate data, esp for the basics like walking and cycling. However, i feel that the diet and sleep parts of the app are slightly complicated, and especially for the diet part, it's hard to use as the food stated are not e.g (asian-friendly) and it's tedious to key in every food i eat. Nonetheless, great app! :)"
"Motivational and Encouraging. This app is great. It not only counts your steps(as long as your phones on you), gives you challenges, programs and a bunch of other things. Helps you monitor water, sleep, food, etc. At the end of the month you can see where you are compared to everyone else in the world (steps wise) or your group of friends. My husband and I use it as competition and its encouraged us to get off the couch more!"
"I used this app for years and years. It wasn't perfect but it was OK. The thing I liked the most was it worked automatically and showed steps/calories etc in the taskbar. Now Samsung have decided that to use the app I must allow access to my phone, contacts and more. I am now about to uninstall this app. From what I see I am not the only one. Samsung are going to regret this as they're losing most of their app users. Bye bye. PS The samsung copy/paste auto response changes nothing."
"Tried to challenge other friends, but it's not working in one plus and other mobiles. Need to fix bugs. Works good in my s9+. Yet, no point in providing the option of challenging others if it is not compatible with mobiles other than Samsung. Oh yes! Fantastic experience with my in-built mobile app although."
"Absolutely horrid. Flashing adds across the top, horrible integrations, and ridiculously difficult to make work properly. I didnt buy a $300 dollar watch to have none of its features be accessible. Returned it and bought a fitbit. My first smart watch was a gear 2, thought they might have improved. Somehow 8 years later, they got worse. So done with everything samsung. Edit: Nice auto reply. How about make something that works? Do you even read these reviews?"
"I've just seen your reply which, at one point, asks me to go to the settings in the app. Which I can't because I can't activate the app because the 2FA doesn't work properly! Standard reply, perhaps? And, no, I'm not going to waste my time contacting the support team. When the app works let me know. >I'd like to use this app but the 2FA won't work: when I provide the code sent by SMS the ""verify"" button remains unresponsive. Nothing makes a difference. Basic fail. I expect better from Samsung."
Why do you need to manage calls and texts? Another bot app that spies on you.
Crashes constantly. Unusable anymore.
Watch exercise data not syncing with the app
"I don't appreciate Samsung's requirement to share my phone number to others who have me in their contact list to send challenges. It should be optional, but its not. You can't use Samsung Health without allowing this permission. There is no reason they need to share my number with anyone. I uninstalled the app, now can't even record my steps. I'll probably go back to Fitbit."
"Samsung changed terms and kicked me out of the app and won't let me proceed without agreeing to allow access to all my contacts. So I no longer use it. Samsung you do not my contacts to operate a health app. Having checked further access to files, media, microphone and phone app is also required. I don't have any other app that required this much access. So it still a no from me Samsung. More flexible approach to permissions would be better."
"The calories spent in other workout modes, such as circuit training, are always the same, regardless the heart rate zones. I can have a workout with and average heart rate of 120 and another one with an average of 160 and the amount of calories is always the same. This is a huge mistake in the app. For what I know, the only workout modes that take Heart Rate in consideration to calculate the calories spent are Running and Walking. Please fix this, since the results are really not accurate!!"
"Now 5 star. Read solve. ""I like the app. Excellent in so many ways but very irritating that the gps mapping has completely stopped working on all activities so I look like I'm staying in one place."" ****Solved. Thanks for the immediate offer of help but I found the answer myself. It needs location permission both in the app and in the phone I.e. in two places. Turned the apps internal location on and it works again. Just wonder how it got turned off. Update?"
"I like that when I use my treadmill my watch auto detects me running so I don't need to upload anything manually. However, I am taking part in an annual virtual race and I need to be able to see my total actual miles for the year. I can't see this in the Samsung Health app, only the average stats which are useless to me. When is this going to change as I have seen a lot of people mentioning this? I've tried looking for an alternative app that auto detects on the watch with no luck."
"Great app for average human, yet could easily get you to the expert area of fitness. Not designed for athletes or those needing to know their exact nutrition macros. But in saying that does a pretty decent job at the nutrition side of things. Would recommend. Only thing wrong is sometimes the step counter bugs and gets stuck which is easy fixed by a restart but still my only gripe. Would work even better with a gear device or similar to pair with it."
"I mostly like this app, but for a fitness app the lack of training options in this app is a bit disappointing. When ever we start an activity there is only 'Time', 'Distance' and 'Calories', this is not even helping the users in any way. I used to track my workouts using my TomTom Spark3 sports watch, i switched to Galaxy Watch3 recently, and i feel like Samsung Health severely lacks in features. Plus the calorie calculation is always off and the distance tracked is also off by -300meters or so. If these can be fixed, it'll be a really great app. Please have a look at the competitor apps and add more features. This app is in desperate need of a overhaul to keep it in the competition. Is there any forum where users can request new features? if such a feature can be built into the app, it'll be awesome"
"I wanted to uese it to track my walk for my PE class and it worked when I was home, than when I left and wanted to turn on the tracking, it turned out there was no such option, they literally disappeared and the only thing it did was counting steps. If I could I would delete it, but apparently you can't do that on samsung, it's just there. I also had to agree to a lot of things and allow access to e.g. my contacts which I didn't understand."
App is scattered all over the place. Workouts such as running 5 k is not detected automatically unless I choose specifically that I am starting running now. The overall weekly or monthly summary is not accurate. Which doesn't help at all. Still good but need to improve in how the overall app shows the results and UI is complicated in some areas
"Hi guys            I am using this app on my s7 edge where it automatically records my sleep timing which is a pretty cool feature.          But yesterday I installed it on my new phone, the ""Realme 6"" but I was disappointed to see that the ""automatic sleep time"" recording is not working which makes this app useless for me. So my question is that is this features work only on Samsung devices."
"It was by far the best weight management application. Anyone with common sense and without serious health problems could lose, gain or mantain a specific weight very easily, without a trainer. Now they decided to remove weight management feature entirely, which makes the app almost useless for me and many others."
"Unsatisfactory I've been using this app with my Samsung s10+. I upgraded my phone to a Samsung s20+. Now there is no option to record the stress, BP and blood oxygen. I'm not sure why a phone upgrade is removing some of the useful features instead of adding to them. Not all customers have or intend to purchase additional items and wearables. Some work in healthcare and can't wear additional items like watches to sync tracked information to the phone."
"I only have 1 issue with this app that I'm hoping will be resolved. The app indicates that users with a Galaxy Watch 3 can monitor stress levels. I have the app on both my watch and phone and in both cases, it is up to date. There is no stress ""menu"" as indicated in the directions on how to monitor stress."
More intrusive since update! Used to work fine but all of a sudden I cant see any of my info unless I sign my life away in personal information. Why on earth would you NEED acess to my phone record just to show me how far I've ran. Absolutely terrible. All my previous is now unobtainable Same with samsung notes... I cant even acess previously saved notes unless agree to all sorts. It's not on at all Im not interested in additional features at least make them optional if that's the case.
"You can only use Samsung fitness peripherals or the device to log steps on this app. You cannot add them manually either. This was the major turn off for me. Other than that, it works great. Especially the function that allows you to log and track your meals and calories."
It counts steps with 80-85% accuracy. You need to pause your step count if you are travelling in vehicle since it will continue to count the steps probably based on your mobiles GPS movement. One feature Samsung could add is to provide start and pause button in the notification itself like music apps so that one doesn't need to go in to the app to pause or start step count.
"It would be a lot more helpful if we could customize. Like for water, I drink a 24 oz bottle. There's no way to enter that."
"Been using for about 4 months with my Galaxy Watch Active. Love the health tracking and exercise watch apps. BUT, recently the handy watch vibrate has been removed where it used to notify you if 1. You get to the end of a set in an exercise, and 2. When the watch detects that you are in the correct position to start a new set in an exercise/when it is ready to start counting reps. If this feature is brought back I would definitely rate 5 stars! :)"
"Hi, Can't sign in to my account from Xiaomi note 9 pro. Please advise. Thanks for prompt reply, though it's bit of weird suggesting to call overseas for such a minor case. Can't the help be provided other way than calling?"
Is it possible to work with Weight Watchers to connect to their app to this & sync ü§î
"I use the app everyday. But, the recent update messed up the workouts. Their verbal instructions are jacked up now."
"Sick to death of this ridiculous app. It was working fine with my old phone, but now on my new phone (Both Samsungs) just will not sync.... apart from occasionally when it feels like it. It synced two 10 second dummy runs in my house last night then this morning when I do an actual run nothing comes across. My runs are stuck on my watch with seemingly no way to get them off. I've reinstalled it twice, reset my Galaxy watch but nothing seems to work and it's an absolute joke."
Intermittent Fasting is an important practice nowsays. I have started doing it more often. There should be a tab for logging fasting data. The dark mode is pretty nice. The graphs have more contrast now. Looks better. Still the sleep tracking not per Fitbit or Garmin level. The HR accuracy is still an issue.
"First of all, a way to disable ads please! I am already using a Samsung phone and watch. I want the app to be clean, not display ads! Second: a way to edit already recorded workout! For example: often I start a Cycling exercise on the way to work. Once I arrive I have to search for parking or start talking to a collegue and forget to stop it, so session turns out 3h instead of 20 min. Please add feature to crop the time!"
"This is the second time now that the app is not singing my steps properly. I'm at 2k so far, but the app shows 800. When I sync, it asked a few more every now and then. So I can't do those extra 1.2k now so the app knows. It's like the app gets stuck at one point and just doesn't recognize the steps from the Galaxy fit e anymore. Anything afterwards is now being synced again, but 1.2k are gone. Only happened 2 times how in about 4 weeks, but that's 2 times too many. And yes, fit e steps is on."
the app used to work great but the new UI is very very bad. it doesn't allow me to check my activities and calories burnt on past days in the activities tab. it also doesn't allow me to edit my sleep time in the sleep section anymore among other issues. please fix it I really like the app otherwise and have used it for years and have so many records set on it I would hate to have to move to another app and lose them.
You get free features that are paid in MyFitnessPal app. This app clears up some confusion I had when I used to use MyFitnessPal. Edit Aug 2020: I'm disappointed that the Weight Management feature is taken out of the app after the recent auto update. It's a very useful feature that is 1 stop shop to have an overview of everything. Now I have to look at the food and comparing it to the active time etc to get the calories deficit. Ugh... Disappointed.
"Good motivator. The community element is frustrating at times i.e. you can't find your posts after you've posted them, and it's difficult to get back to people's comments once you've clicked away from them as they vanish. I'd like to see this sorted. Tracking is random, sometimes it happens, sometimes not. Sometimes my sleep is tracked, sometimes not. It is glitchy but has loads of potential."
"Just got my watch active 2 and was excited to use the samsung health app having heard good things about it. Unfortunately I can't get past the login screen. After successfully entering my login info the app just infinitely spins it's wheel never getting past the loading screen. I've tried all of the troubleshooting options listed in the samsung forums, but nothing seems to work. Seems I'm not the only one with this issue since the last update. Hope a fix comes fast."
The app no longer properly tracks heart rate. The entire reason I got a Samsung watch was specifically because of the heart rate graphing feature which seems to have been permanently removed. The watch was now a waste of money and I'll likely have to switch brands in order to track heart rate again. It's a shame that Samsung removed a feature that was so useful and without warning!
"Samsung health was one of the best health tracking app but in recent updates it lost many useful features. The latest being the ability to move swiftly to a back date to find out more about the details like heartrate, spo2, etc. The trend tab is completely gone and nowhere to look back. You lose motivation if no trends no look back no progress! Bring back the trends to go back and see what we were a month/year back Eg. Weight, sleep, heart rate, oxygen, etc"
No barcode scanner for food. I wanted to .ove from fitbit to a samsing watxh but won't because the barcode food tracking is a must have imo.
"It's a great app in general. Very user friendly and has many different features for setting various healthy lifestyle targets, as well as calculating your food consumption kcl and exercise kcl to workout kcl difference you should have per day to keep you on track with either weight loss or maintaining the weight. However it does mess up the readings and kcl count of the galaxy watch if you add too many exercise programs and doesnt always update from the watch correctly."
"I use this app on note 20 ultra, a flagship from Samsung. Recently I installed an update & there was a shocker. Now samsung health does not show real-time steps. It refreshes the step number every 2 minutes. No option to change that frequency to real-time or for shorter duration. On the other hand, many cheap phones & apps show run time data, average speed, average duration per kilometer, fastest kilometer, slowest, average steps per minute etc. Here you removing features. ZERO STARS FROM ME."
"The upgrade is not an improvement. Now my runs can't be recorded as it keeps pausing. It pretty much ruined my run this morning, perhaps I am that fast it doesn't recognize the fact that I am moving ( not!) so I did as suggested and cleared the cache. Tried again today and it paused again. Also today I ran using a Fitbit versa. Can someone explain to me how my Fitbit records my usual run (5km) that I have been doing for at least 15 months as 4km?!!! Both use the phones GPS don't they?"
Had this app on my old Samsung phone and it was great. Now got an a20e and this app is now hopeless. Most irritating is that location info is switched off so does not track my route or record distance on walking & hiking modes (the only two I use). I have looked in settings which says location & physical activity is allowed & switched on so why won't it record distance & route. Total waste of time if I can't see these.
"the app is generally very good. However, something has changed recently, as the calculation of speed per kilometre is completely wrong. it used to be accurate, so somethings changed. For example, I was walking my dogs and at 6km I had been walking for one hour. The app said I was doing 3.4km to per hour!! Shame as this is important to me."
The stress and heart monitoring doesn't work.
"I've been using Samsung Health for a while now and it's been great, up until a day or two ago. I'm noticing features like the water intake tracker arent working properly? It's not showing whem I've hit targets (e.g. one day I entered 7 glasses, but its showing up that I didn't hit my target of 4 glasses). Can the app have an update to fix these bugs? If it wasn't for this, be a lot higher of a rating..."
I like the app overall. Only started using it seriously in recent weeks. Quite a lot of decent options for tracking food and quantities can be customised. The search feature is very useful. The step count and motivational suspects are good too. Is there any way to delete or edit entries in the 'my food' section of 'add food'?
"Definitely the last update was a step in the wrong direction, first the app won't let me use it without agreeing for Samsung access to my phone and contacts, then when I try to join the monthly challenge it won't let me join unless I agree to synch with my phone contacts and there is no option to not sync. SORRY BUT NO, I do not need you to see my contact to join a challenge or to be able to use the app. Will be deleting the app until this gets fixed."
"It's an amazing app. It helps you to stay focused about your goals. Ever since I have installed it, it's really helpful in keeping a check on my calories intake and sleep routine as well as my heart rate, stress level. Furthermore, you can set different goals and later achieve them."
Besides Google Fit this is my Daily Routine Running App..Great App Great service..Good Results
"Since the new update the app keeps crashing. I am unable to view it at all. But what is strange my watch still seems to be syncing. Just annoying I am not able to open the app. I have deleted cache, data and reinstalled the app a number of times. Just will not stay open. Love that you can add friends and family to the challenges. Not able to contact support as need to call USA. ECG not available as using a Huawei Phone which is ridiculous. Not happy at all as waited so long for function."
"My existing data is also not accessible. It's stuck up at 2 step verification, even after mobile verification, it's not proceeding to next stage."
"Combination of a Samsung galaxy watch 3 and pixel 6 seem to have broken this app syncing. I've tried everything (various resets/cycling Bluetooth, log out and login and reinstalling the app) which fixes it once but then it stops syncing my exercise. Yet weirdly it seems to capture my steps. Hopefully a patch will come along at some point and fix it."
Sadly the last update has messed up the stress and oxy level readings via the S9. Ie always no stress at all and oxy level always 99% The hart beat still works though. As for the rest of the app it's very well thought out and the workout detection etc for the average person is a great feature. But with the sensor issues it seems a bit redundant.
"Honestly, before the last update i loved this app, weight management is now gone and lost all challenge history. The new layout makes no sense, looking at exercise history used to be well organized, now its just useless. How about maybe getting a focus group to test your app before you release it to the masses. I wish i could roll back to the previous version, i usually always decline to update anything Samsung related until absolutely mandatory because its never tested properly."
"Really unhappy. Not customisable enough, I continue to opt to see calories burned but it only gives me calories under for food entries and that is highly inaccurate when I don't want to log food every day. I've come from being a Fitbit user and want to go back. Using with my Samsung Galaxy watch and finding overall the readings aren't sensitive enough. I've contacted Samsung about this issue and haven't heard back at all."
"This app is ok. My main complaint is that it severely underestimates my deep sleep time. I have a Galaxy Watch3, and I believe it's having a hard time because my resting heart rate is higher than average. I'd be happy to send my data to Samsung if it would help fix this. I suspect this is a software issue. Not sure if this is an app issue or a watch software issue. Otherwise I'd like to be able to sync data with Google Fit directly without a 3rd party app. And the ads annoy me."
Sleep data has stopped syncing with my active 2 watch. Otherwise app is easy to use and everything else syncs fine. Will give more stars when this has been fixed. It was working fine up to the last couple of days . Update 08/10/21 all seems to be working fine now. Really good app. Like the excerise programs.
I've come back to working out after a year from injury and I picked up my Samsung watch to start using again with the app and they just don't track any of my workouts as well as it use to before all the updates. I don't know what they have done but so much is missing from the app and it just feels so clunky to get the information you want compaired to before. Thats if its tracked it properly of course..........
"Cannot set up 2 step verification. I get the code in a text, enter it but verify button does not work. Tried multiple times including reinstalling app. Really useful app until now. In response to the developer message. The process you suggest I follow is exactly the one I am doing. The verify button just takes me back to text input after entering the correct code and trying repeatedly."
Requires too much access and control over device without any reason beyond the nebulous 'for optimized experience' line. Why the app needs to for example manage and make calls without a choice to opt out when all you want is a step counter and occasionally check heart rate is as unclear as it is ridiculous. Guess its time to find alternate apps... Edit: the rating for this app seems to dropped a full point since this dumb update. Please take a hint Samsung.
"The last update literally ruined the app. The most useful feature 'wight management' disappeared, 'exercise' shows time in huge numbers and all other information is tiny, totally useless. Together tap is also made worse rather than better. Down to new green colour the update is a total flop, a step back rather than forward. I wish I've never initiated the update. Beyond disappointed."
"Phone calls, why does the health app need access to my phone calls?"
"I've been using some features of this app daily and it works great. Until you get pregnant. Then boom - you're going straight to being overweight in no time and even if I add my menstrual cycle information, the app just doesn't understand that you I am pregnant. No pregnancy mode is an issue for most health tracking apps, but that is crazy. Especially for Samsung - it's not that you don't have enough data to figure it out and put this feature in."
"I absolutely love this app, it lets me keep on top of my steps and sleep and drinking more water and less coffee, however its quite limited, as I can't connect it with my fitbit, which would allow me to get better information from my phone, and I think on the food section, it would make it a lot easier if it came with a barcode scanner so you can scan products you buy and it comes with all the information, like the calories"
"Samsung Health worked perfectly, now it doesn't. All I have done is change my email address and standard system updates. Now it asks for my login details, goes into waiting 'spinning wheel's screen AND STAYS THERE. I have been able to track everything, including my blood sugar (for potential diabetes), now I can't collect a summary on anything. Help !!"
"With the recent update, my sleep pattern is not able to be sync between my Active 2 watch and the app at all. My watch recorded the sleep period but it couldn't connect with the phone app. Hence no sleep pattern could be generated. Other stuffs like the steps are sync. This is bad. If need PM, let me know. For your reply, already sent via the App > Contact Us before I write this review. Many days and still no reply."
"I liked this app a lot until the September update. I used it daily to pace and track walking and enjoyed the clean user interface. While I have grudgingly adapted to the interface, replacing the average speed with current speed has made the app useless for pacing. Update: Average speed put back. (thanks)."
Lost 100 pounds over the last six months with the help of this app and its excellent Weight Management function. The newest version arbitrarily removed it and some other features I liked. Download version 6.10 instead and turn off auto-updates. You'll have a more functional and better looking app.
"Since discovering this app I've been thrilled with the results and it's efficiency. One problem though, I'm in Nigeria and so can't relate with most of the food options thus it's difficult if not impossible to track my calorie consumption. An improvement would be great. Other than that, I loooove Samsung health"
"Unreasonable new permissions required. Access to my contacts? What for? Immediately uninstalled, losing all data, unfortunately. * Re your response: you don't answer my question. This is the same empty response you gave to an earlier rater with the same issue. Must have been automatically generated. **Samsung still does not listen to disappointed former users. Fortunately there are alternatives."
"Good app, but the privacy policy lets it down. I dont want to send all my health data, my location, and my internet browsing details to Samsung. Please release a lite version that just allows me to count steps and check my pulse without having to send any information anywhere. In the meantime I will use alternate apps that thankfully don't require internet connections to work and hence don't send my data back."
"A lot of simple and vital yet missing features in the Food part. 1. To display a live updating nutrition information based on the entered amount of food instead of just the static ""per 100g/serving"". 2. To set your own recommended intake of the individual macros, whether it be by percent or grams, and having the target calories calculated from those. These are very fundamental and simple features that make a big difference, and can bring this app to de facto standard in diet tracking because it's already so close to that. Please implement these features devs."
"The new update had a lot less to offer than the previous versions such as, no caffeine tracker, no food intake balance chart and others. It has a lot less to bring to the table and is just a glorified pedometer now. I'm thinking of switching back to fit bit as they have much more to offer such as personal challenges, daily goals, and other fitness oriented items that Samsung health is lacking"
"The border of the wider widget is now barely visible, it makes the text harder to read against certain backgrounds. Could you make the background of the widget a little less opaque so that the text is easier to read please. Otherwise love the app, specially with the active 2 Update, they actually added updated this and the new widget is great!"
"Very much like the app, however it has a few annoyances. The main one is that the UK uses stones for weight but you only track kgs and lbs. Yes, everyone could learn to divide lbs by 14 in our heads, but that's not great UX. Feels like a significant localisation fail tat should be addressed and is low-hanging fruit. At the more minor end of the scale, no ads on the home screen and a dark mode would be very desirable. The ads are offensive when you've already paid ¬£280 for a watch!"
It used to automatically track my sleep(without a watch) whenever I would simply close my phone and not use it. It doesn't do that anymore. How do I get it to do this again?
"Paid over $300 for the watch but can't seem to use most of the functions because the stupid app won't open. Looking at other reviews, it's obvious that other customers are facing the same problem. How does one go past this?"
"I really love this app,track my steps, workouts,periods and even sleep time, This app particularly is much more accurate in counting steps than similar apps, which probably results from the high coordination between hardware(samsung cell phones) and software. Just there is a problem in walking challenges, for example in a challenge with a target of a few hundred thousand steps, some users reach the target in less than 12 hours, definitely this is fraud."
"I've been using third party apps to sync with Samsung Health just to track things conveniently. I really want to use just one app for automatic recognition for counting steps, running, give you a bit granular detail like quantifying water intake (mL) instead of counting 1 glass per day. I've been thinking lately of moving completely to iOS and WatchOS as it's a one-stop shop for health monitoring/tracking device."
"App generally is good but the charts are inconsistently presented. Heart rate, blood pressure charts etc are relatively useful and well presented. Blood oxygen however is a graphic teardrop that is next to useless. Exporting data is either via PDF or HTML both of which are next to useless to run into a spreadsheet without lots of manual steps to convert and limited to a maximum of 3 months. Surely a CSV file wouldn't be too difficult for the developers to manage?"
"love the app, could you please add a feature to 'trim' the automated run mapping, the few minutes at the end of a run cooling down to a walk bring the average pace really high. also its hard to get connected with friends without looking like a competitive douche, maybe the option to add friends through facebook would be less socially awkward?"
Got a galaxy watch to use in conjunction with strava. All was fine at the beginning then it took a day to sync with strava now it doesn't work at all. After alot of research it seems that it is all down to this app. I thought with the latest updates it would be sorted but Samsung don't seem to be listening to their consumers. Looks like I'll be getting a garmin
"I used to love this app, but it's frustrating when the ""updates"" actually removed some of the best features. SP02, weight management, stress, etc., trends that are actually useable and easy to navigate. I've been using Samsung for many years, but I think it's time to switch. Sorry."
"I use this app with a galaxy fit 2 tracker. Generally I like this app, it encourages me to want to walk more and get stars in the monthly together challenge. One area that used to work, and doesn't - since a recent upgrade when the app was changed to look quite different (the walking figure was removed on total daily steps) the average 7 day weight function no longer works correctly, it suggests my 7 day average is over 100lbs less, so it's way out. Fix this and the review would be 5 stars."
"Having to use factory version on Note 4 as everytime I update to latest version the workouts such as walking and running tracking are continually paused seconds after starting. This makes the app useless for my purposes. Tried fix as suggested but still pauses workouts a few seconds after starting. Also downloaded my workouts to upload to new version, unfortunately there's no upload facility. Went back to factory version but no upload facility there either so I've lost all my records. Not happy"
"Totally agree with a few others, app has been working perfectly up until the last app upgrade in May, now can not sync w Samsung ph & it keeps deleting t current time & date if I do not charge within a day. Weird & frustrating .. Just fix the app so its compatible with all Samsung ph's.. dont want to talk to someone. Fix it please!!! I've been a Samsung supporter for the past decade.!"
"Great app with one minor gripe for me in weight management. Yesterday I was over my daily target but I was still in a calorie deficit. Only way I can check out my deficit is by clicking on 'view calorie status' under weight management and I can only do it for the current day. I have to manually calculate previous days if I forget to write it down. It would be great if I could view my deficit for the previous days, weeks or months regardless of whether or not I actually hit my target."
"I've used this app for years, now I can't use it anymore because i won't give it full phone access. There is zero reason for a fitness app to not work without full phone and contact permissions. I'm not sure if I should delete it or wait until they revert this change. Samsung, I don't care about the together feature. Every other fitness app works without full phone control."
"ECG and blood pressure should be added to this app so all phones can use those features - locking these features to Samsung phones is just going to cause users to hack or send back theses devices, wake up Samsung"
"I really used to love this app, until one day I realized that I was not getting any notifications from the app. Turns out the app refuses to open because of some ""unauthorized changes"" that were made. I have never rooted my phone or made any changes to it like the app is suggesting. It's so dumb that people on non Samsung phones can access the app, whereas I can't on my S8. The Samsung support claimed for me to go to their store to fix this. Guess I'm switching to Google Fit since it works!"
"Good & useful Makes you want to walk more, especially when you're challenging your friends. Nice training options, especially the ""Cycling"" one as it tracks your location, avg. speed you were going with, time, achievements, and so on. 5/5 From me. Also, the User Interface and design are amazing"
"Disappointed. Was hopeful over the Note/GWA2 combo for fitness and health tracking but the experience is so cluttered, haphazard and ineffectual. Your ""rings"" on the watch don't clearly align with any section in the app. Can't pair an external HR monitor to reflect your activity in S-Health without downloading a third party app to your watch, then syncing through Strava and crossing your fingers that it shows up in S-Health. A lot of irrelevant notifications that drain your phone battery."
"Why has the functionality on the Together page reduced in the latest upgrade? The most useful figure, the rolling 7 day step count, has been removed together with the overall average step count. The % figure shown means nothing without the now missing supporting numbers. Surely upgrades should add functionality, not remove it. In my opinion this was a 5* app but not now, though it would not be difficult to reinstate it."
"The usual update saga again. Every time this app is updated, the data is all over the place, especially my sleep. Why does this happen every time??"
"Loved this app until this morning when I woke up to no sleep record or weight management. Get rid of the stress function instead it's absolutely useless, apparently my stress level is always low so unless you are having an anxiety attack you aren't stressed according to this app. I'm stressed trying to find an app that syncs with this so I don't have to put information in multiple times stress tracker still says low!! I thought updates where meant to be an improvement. So disappointing üòû"
Bug on One Plus 8 with android 12: the app doesn't upload a background image selected from the gallery when sharing an activity. Pls fix it!
"Not sure the the app needs to ""access and manage"" my phone. I uninstalled it. Update May 19th 2021. The response still doesn't make sense. There is no need for this app to ""make and manage"" phone calls to improve the overall experience of the Samsung health app. This make no sense whatsoever. Now, not only is the app uninstalled, I don't use the Samsung watch and next time I get a new phone, I'll be looking for another brand for my phone These are the consequences of samsung actions."
"More syncs eith other apps would be great. Etc, fatsecret app is similar and popular just like myfitnesspal which is loosing users. Please sync with fatSecret app. Or make better food calorie intake."
I mainly used this app to track my weight loss. The latest update appears to have lost the feature of tracking weight loss as an average over months and weeks. It only records the daily weight which is disappointing. Weight on a day to day basis goes up and down but the weekly avg and monthly shows me the actual loss as an avg. ie it showed me losing 3-4kg a month.
"Overall, I find this app very useful in tracking and helping me reach my health goals. Some tedious entries could be improved, like Omron BP monitor not being compatible via Bluetooth. Also, would be nice if I could delete entries made in My Food section and show grams option instead of being limited to Serving or Calories...have to manually compute a ratio conversion after weighing food portion once serving size is set. And being able to edit individual brand foods with faulty data."
"Works on the older note9 , but was not on the z4"
"The latest version removes alot of the imagery and leaves big wasted areas of white background. The visualisation of someone walking to their goal is now gone, left with a simple progress bar. The app is now bland and devoid of any personality. Also the adverts are constant. Even with the setting turned off, adverts are still presented through notifications. Which in reality are just notifications to sign up to services - adverts. I've purchased your phone and watch Samsung, isn't that enough?"
Why do I need to allow the app to manage my phone calls in order to use the app. All I want to do is track my daily health and habits. I do not need nor want to have people in my contacts to find me in Together. How do I use this app without allowing this?
I love this app but it doesn't always sync so I'll do a whole day of activity and it didn't track anything. It's very annoying
"With new update it requires permissions to my contacts and making phone calls, even though my watch doesn't have a microphone and cannot do calls technically. I thought this was a bug and wrote to dev email for the app listed in google store, but there is no reply. Without providing permissions to my contacts - and this is not listed in a new privacy policy - it cannot be used. This is frustrating. I am starting to think about some other than Samsung watch and related software."
"Good app, but cannot sign in, keeps sending sign in code to my old terminated phone numbers, no way to upgrade new numbers to Samsung Account, so cannot use, very bad."
App has been great in general but as of yesterday the app crashes when I want to see the data related to my run. Other workouts are fine... just the run component causes it to crash. Please let me know how to resolve... I have forced stopped the app and turned off my phone...neither worked. I also don't want to lose my workout data.
App doesn't track the whole ride. Only recorded the last 1/2 mile of a 1.5 mile ride. Update: I did some research and found that the power save mode needed to be turned off for the GPS to work correctly. Might be something you want to mention during in-app use.
"Not even the real app. This only enables a subset of the features and the real one is only available in the Samsung app store. Another Samsung scam. Also, why does it require a sim card? There is no chance of testing an old watch on an old phone, and for no technical reason. It's for health, not calls and texts."
"So far this app works fine with my Samsung Fit 2 band & S10E phone. Although this fitness band may be 70% - 80% accurate when it comes to steps, bpm & sleep tracking, yet the collected data is easy to view on the app for general monitoring. Perhaps the Food part needs to be more broader, especially Asian simple & straightforward dishes / foods for calorie counts."
Latest update completely broke the sleep aspect. The sleep details screen doesn't show any information. It's just blank. Can't even select days. The data must be there because on the home screen it shows sleep info. But when I tap on it to see the details the details screen is blank. I also can't set or change sleep targets.
Would like to see more readable details on time line of my exercise not just vague bar graph. Drops location and fails to measure steps randomly. Now it is not even counting my steps! Checked all settings etc and restarted phone. Useless app. Uninstalled now.
"The messaging icon popped up on the top of the phone 5 times and i can't get that jogging lady to go away! There's so many up there they overflowed into my clock and my battery reading. I can't tell what either of them say without pulling my screen down. I uninstalled the app hoping they would go away, I hit clear, I turned off the messaging in settings and yes I turned off and on, but those icons r still up there crowding my data to the point where my data is illegible."
"Require access to private data. Anyone can search using Phone number. Access to the phone number can't be disabled. Measuring blood oxygen, heart rate, stress... is not supported on my new Samsung phone. The useful functionality reduced to minimum. Access to private data unavoidable. Positive: i have managed to uninstall it. What a great time when Samsung galaxy S 5 was new. Application was working much better, better setting for options, the phone had more sensors. Your activity was private"
This is not a good app. I would log my new weight and it would literally not accept it even pressing done. It doesn't keep up with your steps accurately. I would look at my steps before walking and it would literally still be on the same number it was on when I started. I have deleted this app and don't plan on using it again.
"Worked good for more than 6 months, but recently, it only shows ""Samsung Health Starting"" on my notification bar, but it never starts up. I've uninstalled and reinstalled with no success. Uninstalling (again) but finding something different this time."
I use this app frequently throughout the day. It is great but a lot of the potential of goal setting against others is ruined by the 'Together cheats'. For example within an hour of the monthly challenges some users have already completed the challenge. This could easily be stopped by having a 'speeding ticket' feature. very good overall
11//12/2022: Latest update changed sleep tracking entry making it impossible to manually enter sleep when the watch doesn't track sleep correctly. Another fail. 1/30/23: Daily activity no longer loads. Just spins at the top of the page.
"FORCED ON ME! How did this app find its way onto my 'phone? And why can't I delete it? This just appeared. I didn't download it. I didn't approve its installation. I wasn't even told 'you're having it like it or not'. I think it must have been part of the latest 'system' update, yet another piece of unwanted bloatware forced on me by Samsung, pointlessly consuming scarce and valuable resources and power. üçåüò§üò§üò§üò§"
"Its just ok. I'm supposed to be able to measure hydration with my new watch 5 pro, but there is no way to do it in the app. It's the only reason I paid the extra money for the pro. May return it. Response to developer. I'm not looking for blood oxygen, I'm looking for hydration analysis. Measures how hydrated you are. This was listed as one of the additonal options on the pro watch"
Update may be broken. I just updated yesterday as I have auto update turned off. Since yesterday my activity and calories burned while active start to accumulate on my watch but then the watch will sync and then drop back to 0. Steps count seems low on average too.
"The app is excellent and easy to use. I want to make a suggestion regarding the workout tracking...while running on treadmill, the distance measured on the watch is usually lower than what's actually in the treadmill, thus reducing the overall speed. I couldn't find any option to edit the distance manually after finishing the workout which is available in many of the other smartwatches( my amazfit bip u has this option). If this feature is added, it will help in better tracking the session."
"Sadly this app doesn't auto record steps on my non-Samsung (Huawei) android phone. I have given all permissions available, allowed write access to system settings, allowed to run in the background and have all notifications running. Nothing works for me. Only option is to manually load the app and let it run in the background which sadly makes the app pretty useless to me as I often bulk close all my apps. I really wanted to sync up my gear iconx with a step count so I have a full picture."
"Solid and smooth interface. Love the heart rate sensor and stress rate. Pretty good app in general, just make sure you pause counting steps unless you go for a long walk. Otherwise, the app will count as steps every time you move your phone up and down,giving you unrealistic results."
"Comprehensive health and fitness app with fun community features. Not convinced the altitude gain measurements on my runs are very accurate - they seem to be overestimated. Also, could do with a more comprehensive list of workout types to record. Gardening for example! Other than that, all features work very well. Great way to track fitness progress."
"Love the app. Been using it for a year now, even inspired my to get an Active 2 fitness tracker. Low score is related to the loss of the weight management feature, one of the most useful features of the app and one I access numerous times per day. Please bring it back."
"The app is good but it has been better. It previously had a weight management function that was great (I have a Samsung watch and was a big reason for buying the watch). For some reason this function was removed. I have failed to find another weight management app that syncs with the Samsung watch (myfitness did sync but does not now). After 4 months of trying to find a solution that was as good as this app used to provide, I may have to justask Santa for a different brand watch this Christmas"
"I've tried this on several android phones and all have the bug: you cannot sync health data between Samsung Health and other 3rd party health apps such as MyFitnessPal or Google Fit. When you try to tap on the toggle that allows data permissions, nothing happens. Please fix this, also make it easier for simple people to sync data between services because diving into advanced settings is confusing for customers."
"I cannot navigate this app! It is directing rather than helping. I want to check oxygen saturation, it goes on about steps and accessories; I want to check blood pressure, no way. Cutesie pictures and more steps, articles I might like. It's like a terrible junk drawer. No help. No how to. No functional menu of abilities."
"after i was forced to update the newest/ most recent version of this app, my stress measurement cant work properly anymore. it always indicate that the stress level is at minimum for everyone all the time (at least 20 trials). Moreover, we tried on another samsung device at the same time, the results were significantly different. Please response asap as this function plays a critical part in my health tracking plan."
This used to be my favourite app for tracking my steps. But since the update it no longer automatically adds my steps to fitness pal and no longer counts my food from fitness pal either despite having uninstalled and reinstalled both apps. I've also noticed the step tracker freezes and glitches when I'm out now So I don't even know if my step count is accurate. The new layout is rubbish too and is a lot more confusing that it ever used to be. Really unhappy with the new update and unless all the bugs are fixed I will have to remove it.
"It's useful when the app is paired with a fitness tracking device like a Smart Watch. As someone with sleeping difficulties, it helps me keep track of my sleep and plan accordingly. I just wished the app had a method of providing direct customer feedback to the developer. While it's good that the app's sleep function provides us with the ability to only rate the quality of our sleep, I just wished it allowed users to record notes regarding our sleep (like a sleep journal)."
It is totally innacurate when it comes to distance and calories!!!
"No longer allows edits to sleeping hours since update. Battery life has became worse, dread to think how long it would last if I had it on anything other lower battery mode"
"If I've got my phone in my pocket, it doesn't count my steps. If I'm on the phone while walking, it doesn't count my steps. Every now and then, when holding it in my hand while walking, it doesn't count my steps. And, please note, this is in the middle of a city with good reception and a map that works, just not the step counter. Very temperamental. Used to work 100% but not anymore. Have re-installed, worked for a week and then the same problem again. Very annoying."
"Love using this app. Increases the fitness because you want to try and reach the stars or beat the amount of previous steps. It gives lots of different exercises to use and time, treadmill, rower, running, walking. I simple love it. On the challenges you can interact with other people on posts but once the challenge is over the posts are gone (each month new challenge)"
Disappointed with the update. Weight Management was a great feature which has been scrapped. Further:- 1. there is a sync issue with MyFitnessPal app 2. Samsung watch I used so far (gear S3 + Galaxy Watch) display a single workout multiple times on MyFitnessPal. Weight Management was so convenient it used to give a summary of calories consumed vs burned. Very disappointed it is taken out from the app but available on watch where this is of no use.
"Pros: ease of installation and use. Setup is easy. Features are good. Tracking is accurate. Improvements required: 1. Consolidated Table to set goals - daily, weekly, monthly across a wide range of metrics - eg weight, diet, steps, distance, calories, etc Location (Country and State) should then automatically display local food items & nutrition values and not generic westernised names."
"The amount of permissions this app demands is ridiculous. Most of the responses state that it is for a better overall experience, but my experience was just fine! And if you don't need to make actual phone calls why exactly do you need a permission to manage them? I have Samsung watch and it worked amazing with this app, but I'll have to switch to something that doesn't require my phone number, date of birth, social security number, the length of my leg in inches and the name of my pet lizard."
"I had this at a 5 star but now everytime I get on the app I am met with a message saying ""can't set up the app"" please fix this. Your app is pretty helpful."
"I cannot find how to change the target for daily steps and I don't think it's as user friendly as the previous version. As per other reviews, I have had steps counted and recorded as attaining goals while sitting in a car for up to 9 hours where the only walking I had done was during food and toilet breaks."
"It is awful. Polar sync is not working. Submitted a ticket for that, received a notification with a reply, but, believe me or not, if you swipe it accidentally, you will not be able to open it. So I have a reply on my case, but I can not even see it. Apart from that, Yunmay sync is not working even though I granted all required permissions. Was it tested at all? I doubt that. You better spend more time on quality of a smaller number of features rather than poorly tested big number of them."
"Two step verification sucks, something very simple should br straight forward, unable to use the app bacause never received a verification code. Poor quality app"
"It's become unusable. It demands all sorts of permissions. It worked fine without them until the latest update so I don't believe that they've suddenly become essential. Maybe for new features, but I doubt it. I suppose this is the prod I needed to look at other apps, but I would have been happier if this app had just continued working."
"This is a good app which integrates with my galaxy watch well and is easy to use. My reason for the 3 stars is the weight management function which is, in my opinion, totally wrong in how it informs you of your progress throughout the day. Every morning it tells me I'm over my calorie intake even though I haven't eaten yet and throughout the day,if you follow it, you'll end up having to eat the majority of my calories as my evening meal!"
"It's a decent app, I had to pin it open always to measure automatically my steps. With a Galaxy watch it works better at my husband. Edit 14.01.2020: I'm using it with a Samsung Active watch for almost a year and it's a lot more consistent. I like a lot of the options and the automatic activity tracker is great for biking when I forget the app. My only sadness is that I can't connect the app to other apps (like my Down Dog). I would greatly appreciate if this would be possible too."
"Frustrated with updates. Everytime my phone updates you have to go back in and set up the app again. If you don't know this and you think its tracking you... you'll be sadly mistaken when you go to open it and find out it reset.... again. Why can't it be reliable like other apps and once you give it permission, it carries over with updates and just notifies you when you need to reread, instead of completely stopping all functionality???"
"Good one. Still long way to go.. Required must-have features: 1. Setting to stop the screen from going to sleep. 2. Dark mode 3. Default Sleep duration can be auto-picked up by time of stopping mobile usage in the night & alarms in the morning. 3. Ability to input other parameters in each workout. E.g., my excercise bike shows calories burned based on rigidity & distance. But this app shows its own approximate calories simply based on duration. Users should be allowed to change this number."
"I don't use this app anymore as a result of both the loss of the spO2 function on the Note 10+, and the removal of the spO2 standalone function. I am seriously considering reverting to older versions with both - Or a change from Samsung as a result. Functions that set the phones apart no longer do. No point paying 2-3x what you would for a same-spec phone from somewhere else. How many times do people have to say it, Samsung, before you will once again listen to your customer base..."
"Update 09/08/2020: Removing the weight management feature was the worst move that could be done. I used it every day. Now I have to get 2 apps to do the same job S-health did, but poorer. Is Samsung planning on ever releasing a weight management feature again? Ruined app. Every time i try to log food in, it shows no data and can't register anything. don't have a way to refresh the app to show what was logged. Asks to set target weight every day to calculate calories. Clearing the cache doesn't help if I need to do this every day. Old version was reliable, this new one is more trouble than worth."
Not being able to get full functionality of the app and watch unless I purchase a Galaxy phone will only make me shop for another option for my next watch.
"Overall it's useful, however I have some reservations. Number 1: checking oxygen in blood would be very useful during Covid. Then there is the community challenge, where apparently one person can have 3 marathons worth of steps in a day! It is very discouraging for the person that wants to keep it honest. The meal log should have scanning feature instead of removing it altogether, as they did in Germany. We started to rely on this app and it is upsetting that some features get removed."
"I love this app but why has the weight management food feature been removed where it tells you whether you're under, good or over compared to your exercise. This was a really good feature which I use daily especially since having to work from home. It was a fantastic visual which helped me to get my active time in to balance out my food intake. Please bring this feature back!! With that feature the app would definitely get 5 stars! Thanks"
"Cannot even use it, the two factor authentication ""Verify"" button stays disabled after putting in the code. I tried clearing data as well, no luck. Fix this issue and I will update the review. Edit after response: you misundestand. I cannot complete the verification, even after entering the code I receive from SMS, the verify button is disabled, greyed out. So no way to get passed this point."
"The new slogan of S Health: you don't lose weight but we lose features every update. Very disappointed with the loss of weight management feature. You don't need to do that. Each update in the app, worse the app and less valuable! In times, it was the best health app, it is no more! (and don't tell me to call to your support)"
"App needs telephone number, else doesn't work. Not acceptable. I want to use the app without sharing my telephone number."
App won't let me continue without letting it have full control over my contacts. Won't let me proceed on my phone/ watch. Horrible app
"The app is useless. I did 40 minutes walk and it only counted 8 minutes. A total of 1125 steps counted. It kept pausing from time to time and did not include journey back home. Using 3D Trisport pedometer, it counted 4374 steps over 40 minutes. I feel frustrated with Samsung health app because I have experienced similar problems before."
"Automatic Sleep tracking isn't as robust as previous versions... It seems to be stopping halfway through the night or if you happen to get up and use the bathroom, it assumes because you walked your up and that's it for the night. Not ideal as I bought it for the sleep tracking with blood O2 capabilities Expect a generic reply from Samsung asking you to call a US number.... A little presumptuous to assume we all live in the USA!"
"Overall, the app is great for workout tracking. But it is inconvenient in these situations: 1) Automatic workout detection threshold of 10 minutes can't be customized. 2) Only a few selected vitamins and minerals can be tracked in meal nutritions. Majority of the recommended nutrition intakes can't be tracked. 3) Food tracking is very limited to pre-defined meals, such as breakfast or morning snack. You can't add several meals of the same type through the day, like multiple afternoon snacks."
"Good UI and has everything you could want data recording wise, so the app is very good there. However it lacks in some areas as follows: 1) Android Tablet or Windows Laptop app support does work because of ""No SIM Card Detected"", so therefore you can ONLY view your data on your phone (limiting). 2) The food diet section has no scan barcode option, which means MyFitnessPal is much much easier to use day-to-day, as typing in everything and searching is painful. Sort these you'd get 5 Stars!"
"I was stuck on no network connection error 0x270001. Got a quick response from Samsung, which prompted me to think a bit more, not so easy since I'm at home with covid, which is why I was looking to set up the health monitor features. Figured it might be the VPN I have, and indeed switching it off allowed the app to connect. So updated to 4* for prompt developer response."
"Great app, it's really helping me lose weight. Feature request.. needs a readiness or recovery score."
"I don't like the new interface at all, it's like a totally new app now. Instead of having everything fit on one screen I now have to scroll around to find what I need. Biking has been bundled up with exercise so I have to make more 'clicks' to get where I want. I don't understand why app makers do this, users were used to the old interface and now have to relearn the app. There was nothing wrong with the old interface.. this makes no sense, if I wanted to use a different app I would have downloaded it already. I wish I could roll back to the previous version but I guess I need to look for an alternative app"
"This is a great app. But under ""Together -- Monthly challenges"" people are faking the daily step counts Top in rank people are posting 6 digit scores for a daily step counts."
Really awful. Cannot be used without phone number. Cannot be used stand alone. Samsung kills privacy of your health data. Shame on Samsung!
"This stupid app going in loop asking for 2step authentication. If it is mandatory why the hell you give a skip option. If it is not mandatory why don't you remember my selection. Who idiots are making this stupid app... If you do not know tell me, i can create a better one for you.... What an epic reply...great"
Got a new phone and it will not recover information. It want let me use the email I set it up with and it started me all over at level 1 when I was on 25
"The latest update on the app has made the app redundant. The one feature which made it worth using, the weight loss feature, has been taken away. Until now this I was raving about this feature and now will be forced to find another app. With this feature I really felt empowered to manage my health and weight loss in a way that worked for me. Now however I feel like the rug has been pulled from under me. If you want to attract and retain users I suggest you bring this feature back."
What happened to the snore detection? It doesn't record anymore
"Amazing looking app and has some great features! Sadly the app has some bad falls and is cool but confusing the way calories are calculated. Not being able to control macro neutrient ratios carbs, fats, proteins and liquids based calories are only in grams not Milliliters sucks badly!!, you also cant change what is considerd a ""cup of water"" in terms of milliliters either."
"I replaced my Note 9 with the Ultra 22 and am very disappointed that this app doesn't measure my heart rate like it did before. It's useless. Why is this? And, don't tell me you contact you, like you've told others...... Just answer it right here."
"Hello Samsung, I have install this application but the pedometer is not working well. Application doesn't count steps in background. I also cleared the caches files but doesn't worked. Then I clear all data. Still same issue. I have also reinstall the app but it is also doesn't work. App does not count the count even the application is opened. kindly let me know what should i have to do it. I have Redmi note 8. Thanks un advance."
Very disappointed with the app. Weight management and stress management not working or perhaps just not available also it is the the worst app for recording food easily and does not sync with cronometer or any other app with macro nutrients. I bought a galaxy active watch to utilize all these features. Is it me or has the colours also chaged? Very hard to read now.
Tried to use for swimming but it cannot tell the difference between swimming a length and swimming a breadth. Counts both equally.
"Does not login on Pixel 2! What the hell?! Why isn't anyone fixing this??!! I spent 300$ on the watch and i cant not see the data. I have tried everything i found online including re-installing the app, clearing cache, reboot the phone! None of it works! I'm not going to call you for this. The app obviously has a bug and you've got to fix it"
"I changed to sony for a long time now, but I have to admit that this app have one of the most precise tracking system. Because I use it to track my skating route, my path does not even exist in the map but it able to track my route precisely. Amazing. And one more think, don't say ut doesn't work if u use a entry level device. I use my Sony Xperia XZ3."
"Since last update, no longer allows you to edit sleep. I have tried clearing the cache and it did not solve the problem."
"Needs a Samsung account to work, and that is a known privacy risk. Now insists on knowing your phone number to ""share"" with the ""community"". This app is a data harvesting scam."
"Since the recent update this App no longer works as it should do. Has stopped counting steps. I am going to uninstall it. Been happy for 2 and half years, absolute rubbish for last 2 weeks!!! Have tried the things in your reply but still not counting all the time. I shouldn't have to reset counting steps every time I pick it up!!"
"Excellent! Mostly works with my Galaxy watch, apart from an occasional glitch. On the whole, I'm very happy with the App, which I've been using for a couple of years. I'm walking a lot more and lost weight so that has been a real bonus! I like the 'Together' features which help me to keep going all month. Keep up the good work!"
"My only regret is that I can't give you zero stars. Hey Samsung, the fact that I can't opt out of sharing my phone numbers so I can connect with others is a huge red flag. Deleted."
Immensely less useful following the removal of the weight management features and other features. I purchased Active Watch 2 specifically because I enjoyed using the trackers for calories and weight to manage surplus and deficit. Very disappointing. Edit: As per the response from samsung I reached out to support and only got a canned reply. Losing this feature removes so much usefulness from the app for me. Please put this feature back in.
Highly inaccurate values! A fast jog for one hour shows a very low calorie value of 400 and the distance around 6.5 kms when it was showing 620 cals and around 8.5 kms for the same duration previously... totally a hopeless app if you want to know the accuracy of your running .. the issue has been running for more than 3 weeks now while it was showing the correct values before that.. it highly messes with the running accuracy
Wish this app can be synced with Mi Body Composition Scale 2
"Only have to support my Galaxy Watch 3. Issues with that (have to reset Bluetooth on watch+phone daily to get it to sync). Recent update is a step backwards. ""Womens health"" feature is pathetic and, i.m.o., demonstrates apathetic approach from Samsung. I can log my period, but now that I'm pregnant, I'm just 141 days late. Can choose to download awful partner app for more features, which requires a further 3rd app if you're pregnant and further subscriptions if you want to use full features."
"Website to create account checks your browser and refuses to work without one of their own list. Why can't my email address have the word samsung in it? Now I can't use the app, will have to sell watch."
"Very full-featured app. Personally I am still having problems with the built-in swim and sleep tracking. I have started using external apps to track these. I would ask that ""halfbike"" riding is included as as an activity as this burns more calories than regular biking. Overall I am very pleased with the app and would increase my rating if these problems are fixed."
"I've been using this with gear S3 but with every update it becomes more and more inaccurate and has become useless now. It states I'm running when I walk so doesn't record steps, states I'm sleeping when I'm awake (sat at my desk,) doesn't record stairs unless I walk up or down a hill and much more. If you download this ensure auto updates are inactive!"
"This app was pretty good, but recently it has started crashing repeatedly. I won't even have the app open and it will give me a pop up crash report. It won't even let me send feedback. I only got my galaxy watch a couple months ago so this really sucks."
"Needs a longer countdown than 3s before start of run to allow enough time to keep your phone. Alternatively, start it paused like Strava.‚ñ™Ô∏éMake it auto-pause sooner after you stop running. Currently there is a delay of ~10s, which is too long.‚ñ™Ô∏éMake it a setting to record workout ONLY when you RUN i.e. auto-pause when you slow from a run to walk and resume workout only when you start running again.‚ñ™Ô∏éThe speed/cadence graph is too coarse. Let us drag our finger along the plot to view each instant"
"Overall had a nice experience with the App. However am using the app in both Galaxy watch active and Samsung s10. Last day went out for a walk with my baby in his stroller and the app recorded it as cycling while I was just walking. Otherwise it usually gives good results. My wife has a fitbit and it shows more steps and more km , but we both walk the same stretch together! Either one if these are not showing accurate results!!"
"So far, I'm loving all the new features of this app, especially the programs. I also like how you can customize your target. A water intake reminder would be an amazing feature & maybe a wider scope of calories information for local foods. Nonetheless, I feel more motivated to do a healthy living everyday. Thank you for this great app!"
"The latest version is seriously flawed. The calls management requirement is totally unnecessary, seeing up 2fa crashes, and then will not let you continue due to session bring expired. The app asks to log in again, but that isn't possible due to the crashed setup process. Furthermore, when trying to set up the, apparently required, 2fa it doesn't work. I enter my phone number, get the code, enter the code but the ""Verify"" button remains shaded. After several resends it worked. Still, very poor!"
"I like the detailed stats. However there are serious issues with the GPS during runs. Instead of a straight line, it's always squiggly. All those extra bits add up to an extra 1km in distance over a 7km run! This is comparison to other apps, which are using the same watch and phone at the same time as Samsung Health, and show my route correctly as I ran it. Also please add ""stroller walk"" as an option, don't you know how many parents walk with kids in the pram for exercise?? Google Fit has it..."
Bought a Galaxy 5 and downloaded the Samsung Health app for a very specific purpose - as a simple ECG monitor. Confirmed this was available in my region (UAE) before purchase but on delivery found that this isn't actually possible. Tell me I'm wrong but otherwise this is a total waste of time and money (by the way I'm an elite athlete and a doctor so I know how to use ECG data)
A recent update has me using this app again. I still want my gps to work consistently with my Samsung Gear watch (it works probably 75% of the time) and I REALLY want a run/walk interval training choice on the app but overall? It is much better. I still want to find a Samsung watch with fall detection. If Apple can do it and it works in Canada? Samsung can do it.
"In general I do like this app and its features, although if I would change or update one thing it would definitely be the heart rate feature. I wear the Samsung galaxy active 2 watch and although this app tracks your heart rate it lacks a bit. It would be great if we had the option to go more in depth as far as checking out what time your rate was at what BPM.. for example with the Fitbit app you can. Same with the sleep tracker! Would be a great addition!!!"
"Unfortunately far from good enough and there does not seem to be an intention to move forward. Samsung improved a few areas but backtracked on others. Examples would be removing time frames from measurements like weight, blood pressure, .. Daily measurements do not work for all of us. No matter you want to force us. Food management is poor.. I do not understand who in Samsung believes that fixed calorie target is a workable solution. Really??? It's time to finally wake up or be forgotten."
The app should allow to pick location/ or the language inside the app. You are not able to find Brazilian products if the device is in English and the opposite is true if you are in Canada and have the device in Portuguese. Allowing to pick the app language could make this easier without having to change the whole device. (German is hard)
"For the past 3 days I have been walking around different locations, the app is no longer counting my steps. Thanks for the help it is working now"
I have been happy with this app for some time using it to measure distance and speed of my regular morning walks. However since yesterday it has frozen and does not allow me to either resume or finish activity. üòì So have uninstalled and now going to reinstall to see if that resolves issues. I already tried turning phone off and on with no benefit.
"This is good for tracking exercise and food, although there is still for not available on the system. but it used to be better with the weight management widget, I used it year ago and lost a bubch of weight but i cant do it again, and i dont want to have to turn to other apps because alot of them either dont sync properly or at all with the app.would be really good to get that function back please"
"You removed useful stuff!!! What is the point of a health tracker if your going to remove vital stuff like the weight management portion? This is vital for me to know when I'm in a deficit with my intake over the day. It also encourages me to eat and log and workout (if I have a snack attack) now I'm only going to know what food I'm eating. Very disappointed I invested in my smart watch so this would all tie in together, now I'm having to look for a separate app instead of it all being together"
"Latest update has made it constantly close. I have a hauwei p20 pro and it opens, but theb closes just when I get to the home screen. It makes it completely unusable. I've tried force stopping, restarting the device and then also uninstalling and reinstalling the application, none of which has resolved this. Please fix this as it's making it pointless to own a Samsung wearable device for fitness tracking."
"Just cannot log in to my account. I DO have one. The app tracks my work outs, steps, cycled miles etc. However, I try to use the Together feature to add friends but when I've logged in, it just goes straight back to the log in page. Even in the browser, I can't log in. Email and password is definitely correct. I've cleared caches, restarted the app, rebooted the phone. No joy. Phone is HTC One M10 with appropriate software. I also have the Samsung 46mm watch."
Too many bugs. Not a stable app.
This app is good and I use it to check my steps everyday ... It would be great if it can display the steps in the lock sceen and in the AOD .
"Excellent features combined with a Galaxy Watch 4. Tracks all the relevant data with decent presentation. Could be a little clearer with analytics (how/where you are compared to the average/best/worst in your age). One extra thing that would be very useful is a 'fitness age', I personally miss that. Overall a very useful app."
"Why does the weekly summary barely work now? It either takes 6 days to come (used to just take ~12hrs) OR it skips a whole week plus eventually shows results for the week after the one that was skipped and no results for the skipped week.ü§îü§îü§î‚ùìÔ∏è CURRENT SITUATION (1-14-23): The last weekly summary i received was the week of December 18, ""2022"". ü§îü§îü§î‚ùìÔ∏è"
"This app is handy but needs some adjustments. You should be able to scan a bar code for the exact product and a big thing, you may have it but I can find it. For ingredients or items like blue berries you should be able to pick units of measurements ie, teaspoons, tablespoons, cups, or individual pieces so we can get an accurate number you only have it in grams or calories. Just something to think about for your next update"
"every update makes this slower and kore glitchy. it niw takes abiut 30 seconds to open. every tab change hangs for ages too. Edit, may 2021, it's even worse now. Nothing syncs. Can't update quick messages. Can't use 'together' on the watch. Sync with app and watch fails most times (more than one watch in the family) you're worse than apple now. Test your software before release"
"I have been using Galaxy Watch (Active 2). A fantastic watch that is let down by a most ameture and pathetic health app. Nothing works properly. Weekly report is not delivered consistently. $10 Mi band's health app gives you a far better insights and analysis. The only useful feature that was working was the weight management feature. That is gone. So if you are thinking of buying a Samsung smartwatch, think again. The watches per se are fantastic but it is synced with this crappy application."
I used this app so much. Had my old Samsung Note 10 plus working with it. Now upgraded to the Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra and can not even open that app anymore. Even saved all my data from old phone in Samsung storage.Deleted the app on the old phone. Still get the message: Can't set up the app. Check your network connection and try again (0x2700001) This is so frustrating
"It has helped me immensely at losing weight, as well as forming a healthy eating and sleep routine. Easy to use and straight to the point. Edit (03/17/19) - Issue was fixed; rating back to 5 stars. Keep up adding new features and, hopefully, expanding to other countries!"
"The app works fine with my Watch Active. But i do have trouble analyzing my health info on the app. It would be better if the health heart on the watch is shown on this app as well. Moreover, the heart should be shown calenderwise , it would be better to track trends in the app that way. Righ now there are multiple things shown categorically. It would be better to also show an overall summery in this way. It would be good if you work on this aspect. Thanks!"
"Hey Samsung, please pleaaase improve the performances of this app!! Was used to love it and still want to use it on a regular basis, but this is really not suitable for a daily use on an extended period. The lags are turning me crazy. It takes 4 solid seconds from the moment I select food on a list and the moment it's actually selected."
"Why can't they just keep it simple, just want to use the app the way I used to in the beginning, with calorie counter and no need to create an account to sign in. Don't care about this ""better overall service experience"", looking at the comments it hasn't made anything better. Going to be looking for a new smart watch and phone when it's time to upgrade."
Workout share feature. Why would you change the coolest feature you have on Samsung Health to something very useless and ugly? As of the 11th of February the overlay image of the map is now just a scribble. It used to be a coloured map with start and finish flags. When do you intend of going back to what it was? How can you degrade a feature and call it an improvement?
"It maybe a good app for those who are new to the smartwatch/ smartphone scene. But for someone coming from garmin (fenix 6 pro), the app needs massive improvements to something which is similar to the connect app. I prefer their daily and weekly breakdowns. I like the calories expendeture for the day. I also love their activity summary / workouts on the main page. Garmin is definitely ahead of samsung for the health app. I also hate the advertisement at the top of the Samsung health app."
The screenshot for this app show daily activities... how do I get this to show up as I can not find it at all?
For about 6 months in early 2020 the app would stop tracking workouts when the phone screen turned off. The problem seems to have been fixed now and the app has been working well again. I like the simplicity and clarity in the way it's laid out and can recommend it again.
"All in all decently working and looking app with with one MAJOR flaw - which is that it doesn't include the blood pressure monitor. Only reason I bought the watch was for that reason and nowhere was mentioned you need the extra app, which conveniently is only available to Samsung phones (not hard to guess why). There is literally no reason why the app isn't available on Google play because it's been pirated and works absolutely fine on non-samsung phones."
"Since recent update, walking route not showing on map. It just shows a green circle."
"Worst app ever. It keeps wasting data. For every workout session, it downloads the videos, it doesnt matter whether they are the same. Above that, sometimes download fails and we need to start over. Also after a workout session is completed, the app says 'session is incomplete, do you want to make up'. Filled with a lot of bugs."
"I'm switching to Google Fit until some major changes hit this app. Add auto-tag for resting heart rate, add more heart rate monitor intervals, add location to activities tracked with watch and phone present. The app is becoming more insular all the time, what with removing the ability to sync steps across with Health Sync, and just generally not being supported by any other damn app. Response to Reply: I'm in the UK, I can't call that number."
I have just purchased a galaxy Active 2 and I am extremely disappointed to learn the calorie count is totally off. After reading through the Samsung community I can see many people have the same issue and it has become evident the watch does not take into account your heart rate to calculate calories burnt. I can see people have been complaining about this for over a year but no solution seems to have been provided. I will be sending the watch back!
"Used to have no issues with this app and used it to track daily walking over the course of the apps them on my phone. Recent update lost all my prior walking data, introduced a new layout that complicates usage and seems to have added a new feature that will creepily monitor when you are asleep despite me not giving the app permissions to do so. Have uninstalled."
Great app but there is room for improvement. I find it quite intuitive and easy to use though I wish it allowed you to enter food for tomorrow instead of either on the day or retrospectively . Being able to plan out my diet before hand would be very useful to me in helping me achieve my weight loss goals
Randomly adds 1000s of extra steps when I am sitting at my desk at work. Working with my Samsung watch and checked its not duplication. Very unhappy üôÅ
"Basic UI Rather dull compared with Garmin for example. Display of sleep data looks terrible on the Fold with the graphic squeezed on one side and information on the other. Lacks any ability to dig deep into the sleep cycle. Also you are forced to view it in portrait, landscape is not supported. I've just returned to Samsung Health after quite a time using Garmin connect and if anything Samsung health seems to have deteriorated in its display of information. Very disappointing"
"Not able to register. Earlier it had worked very well on this phone. Repetitive two step verification process, not proceeding further with installation"
"Since I got my first galaxy watch I was really excited about ""Samsung Health"" and it is really a usefull thing to have since then. After every workout it gives me a lot of detailed information about it. The app is easy to use and it also looks pretty good. If you don't have smartwatch it is a great app on phone too since it has pedometer in a lot of Samsung phones lately. The app does not have annoying ads and you can compete with friends in different step battles."
Very happy with the app. Love the format and layout of the period tracker especially
"Samsung health is a wonderful app Which motivates people to act on results. It has targets and compare option etc which are competitive. But as the app goes into background it just stops recording the activities. Hence once the results are looked into there will be sparring differences as most of efforts are not recorded. After few days we may not look into what actually happened but notice that we only did little, this demotivates us. Please workout a real solution for this,"
Great to have fitness analytics and data. Just a suggestion box item: If there could be longitudinal data in the 'Excercise'-item for average and maximum speeds pehaps in the form of a line graph so that a user might be able to visualise and compare running speeds over time. That would be the icing on the cake of an otherwise excellent User Experience. Keep up the good work guys üëåüèæ
"It was a really useful tool for losing weight. But the latest update has changed my opinion. I can't even count my coffee intake anymore. What a shame, I was 94 kg last year and went down to 82 kg using the app , was in the process of starting to lose a bit of weight again after being less active due to covid19 rules . Unfortunately may uninstall this app and try another. Shame was good."
"I have now uninstalled this app twice and finally for good now. It keeps recording my distance wrong, I cycled over 10 miles and the app shows 3.6 miles in total. Absolutely useless. I have tried all solutions available online, none works. Ridiculous! Samsung please fix it. Considering you are one of the largest business in this industry, at least you should get this right. I have downloaded strava for now and would trial that and see if that records it right."
"Love the app but wish there were more solo challenges/incentives as none of my contacts actively use the app. Intuitive pop ups to guide first time users would make onboarding less time consuming. The option to remove the ads once they've shown once would also be better. Hi again, I'm in the UK and I get Samsung products apps on the home page."
"Great app. Just got myself a Samsung s10. Had the s6 and s8. The s6 and s10 both state how many kms/hr you are walking but states specifics (e.g. you are walking 6.1kms/hr) whereas the s8 did not (you are walking 6point kms/hr). So I am glad that is fixed. Reason for not giving 5 stars is because my steps are not accurate at times. With no exercise function active, I can walk several kms and only record 600 steps (usually get 1000+ steps/km). And is there a way to change the devices voice?"
It used to work very well. Then it became useless. It was updating for days and not recording any exercise data. As a reply to my first negative review I received an email suggesting the solution would be deleting the cache. Done it. Still the same problem. Deleted the app and installed a new version and gave it another 24h try. It seems to be working well now. I am not impressed with the reply of the programmer to my second review. Couldn't understand it.
"App was working fine until the latest update, now I can't even open it. Accepted one of the 'optional' terms on the first opening and it kept cycling back to try and get me to select both, I couldn't pass this point. Closed the app and tried to reopen and now it just closes as soon as the screen appears on my phone."
I have enjoyed using this app. It has given me some ideas and motivated me. I am learning how to keep moving to get my weight down and maintain it.
"I have had this app on my phone for about 6 hours now, and I can already tell it's terrible. For one thing I've been walking around all day and it has only counted 12 steps. It doesn't connect to Google fit (which i would like to believe is closer to correct than Samsung health) or Veryfitpro (for which I have a fitness tracker). I have not gone through the rest of the features, but step-counting or activity-tracking (which is what I had downloaded it for) is off by a few thousand steps."
"Used to absolutely love this app, calculates your steps, your stress and your sleeping patterns. But about a month ago it started to constantly lose signal and when I take a break on my run to check the app it still has me at were I was half an hour ago and then when it finally recalibrates to where I actually am it just goes in a straight line to where I am and when that happens according to the app I cut across fields and a river. Very frustrating and has caused me to exercise less."
Lost my data due to app issue. It won't open cuz it thinks my Samsung S8 is rooted. It's not rooted! So I uninstalled and reinstalled it worked but all my data history from 2018 is gone. Can download as a csv from my Samsung accounts but doesn't show up in my app. Not happy. So now it looks like I new user again. Also every time the app updates. It gives me the same error msg and won't open until I reboot the phone. Then it works again. So mad.
"App is very useful, but whenever I want to use 'together', I tap start and nothing happens. I also cannot be seen on a list of friends on my friends' devices. Several updates, but the problem is not solved. I don't want to reinstall the app because of the data I have there."
"This app is incredible. I've always had Samsung phones yet my discovery of Samsung health was just what I needed. I use almost all its features. From tracking my sleep, water intake, to tracking my exercises. Also, I enjoy participating in the together challenges where I track my steps and kilometers I walked in a day. I been improving my health this way. Finally, I find the discover folder to be useful with the featured articles, workout programs, and mindfulness meditations."
"Version 6.11 is going to remove weight tracking, the one feature I use Samsung Health for. Time to switch to Fitbit and maybe even ditch the Samsung ecosystem. UPDATE 2021-02-10: To my surprise, after Android 11 shamefully ignored my ""do not auto update"" setting for my apps and installed Samsung Health v6.15, the new version actually maintained the weight tracking feature. I don't know if Samsung reneged on their plans or just listened to their customer base, but I wanted to say thank you."
"After receiving the latest update I'm simply not able to use the app at all. I get a message saying ""Can't set up app. Samsung acount session expired. Sign in to Samsung account again."" But on the Galaxy wearable app I can log in without problems, so it's not a matter of wrong credentials. Really frustrating."
"Very good app. One thing that I might add would be body measurements (optional, of course) because weight fluctuations can be very unreliable. The app could show users how to measure correctly, something many people get wrong. Also, measurements are a better indicator of health than BMI for overall health, and can be used to compute an approximative body fat percentage/waist to hip/waist to height ratio."
"Yeah, the app sucks now that we have to agree to the app being able to access and make calls. So I uninstalled it and will continue to use my Fitbit. I used both just to get an average of what I do in a day. Get rid of that feature and I may install it again. Also, it tended to record the distance I walked and display it on the day before. For example, today I walked 6600 steps but it would show up in yesterday's report and not today's..."
"This app was perfect for what I needed and have done so well to lose weight, but since the recent update, this app has been rendered useless!! I'm so annoyed the option to see my remaining calorie intake has gone! That was the main purpose of the app for me, how am I supposed to manage my weight without knowing where I'm at?? Now I'm forced to look elsewhere! Bad move!"
"It's alright, has potential. Food database and tracking is lacking compared to MyFitnessPal. It only tracks basic micros ans macros. None of the items show potassium for some reason. No barcode scanner. That said, even integration with My fitness is wonky. For example, all my nutrientional info is almost double what MyFitnessPal says. Can't figure out why. It would ve nice to be able to customize macro targets as well as water and caffeine intake, instead of by cups. Sticking with MyFitnessPal."
"I love this app, auto tracks your foot steps, etc. The sleep tracker is a major reason why I love it, suggests your sleep & wakeup times based on usage. Down side is what if I want to log on a nap during the day. Or what if I get up during a rough night for a couple of hours then manage to dose off again, currently you can't log that. Sometimes the workout doesn't register the cycling & just tracks it as walking, etc Why the hell does it need to to make & manage phone calls..? Replacing it NOW"
I was using this app to track my weight loss then Samsung decided to prevent me accessing my own data so I unusualled it. Now I use a great generic Weight Tracker app. I would have continued to use Samsung Health but Samsung won't let me. The great thing about there being so many other free products is I can simple say good bye to Samsung. Oh and ever tried to get support from Samsung? There isn't any!
"The latest update removed/messed with some features: 1. The morning, afternoon & evening snacks (now I gotta add them all at the end of the day); 2. The nutrient balance score is ruined now 'cause you can no longer see how many grams of each nutrient you need; 3. The floors climbed feature was very good, now it's gone. Also, for specific exercises, besides duration or burned calories target, let us set reps target and track calories burned for each individual rep depending on each exercise type."
Last update has wiped all fitness/meditation exercises and playlists. I used to use it all the time because it used to be a great app but is now useless and won't work at all. Please fix these problems.
"Its awesome when it comes to the challenges. I used to like to more before the update. Please bring back weight management, that helped me to keep in track and balance of my calories. And help me have a more balance workout and food. Ever since Samsung removed the weight management, it has become useless."
Overall a great health/fitness app (especially with a samsung smartwatch/activity tracker)! Features I would like to see in future updates: dark mode; workout charts showing more than 2 things at once (e.g. speed + heart rate + elevation); barcode scanner for food; trends by years (in addition to days/weeks/months); satellite view for map; more types of global and 1:1 challenges.
"With the new update you have ruined everything. First new arrangement is absolutely unfriendly and awful. Secound and most important thing is that the step counter is not working properly. I pass 20-30 steps and nothing happened. After that if I pass another 30-40 steps the previous steps are not counted. By this thing I loose per day about 30 percent of the steps by day. (I have cleared the cache of the program, furthermore and the system cache of the whole phone and nothing happened. It continues to do that.)"
"The total sodium for the day that is recommended is way too low and the actual nutritional value is absolutely too high and incorrect. It counts a whole serving when I only to eat half, fat too. The recommended carb value is way too high; the app should recommend more fiber than carbs. In addition, I hate counting steps. I don't carry my phone all day! I would rather have minutes logged and measure my endurance. If I log minutes I can see how fast I walk or run a mile and see my improvements."
"This app has been good for me. I like that it can automatically track my sleep hours without me having to push any buttons to do so, has many amazing features including tracking my cycle very accurately and because of the many amazing features I am on the right tract with losing weight and being healthy. I do however would like them to fix their food calorie counter as they do not have enough food options but glad otherwise they we have other apps that are connected to help with this"
"Hi, I cannot record by weight on Samsung Health,didnt have a problem before.I use it on my weightloss journey and i dont want to keep deleting and installing because i am losing my record and target.How soon will i be able to record by weight Regards Tasha"
Great app for monitoring your health. Would be good if there was an option to hide those cheating in the step challenge as it may take the incentive out of doing it in future challenges. Barcode scanner for food items would be handy as well. Oh and the ability to add additional activities would be helpful.
"Add weight sync with Google Fit or 3rd party scale devices, please"
Ruined the app. Can no longer share data to spreadsheet or use any data effectively. Brought back to lowest common denominator.
"Since the recent update, i hardly use the app because the weight management is gone. It is very important for me to se my calories in vs calories out. The app also sometimes does not recognized when i started walking, and also my time of sleep is not that accurate. Can you bring back the previous version"
"Started using App on galaxy S10+ and was great. After a week it keeps on crashing when accessing workouts etc. Updated App and phone, cleared caches and no difference. No support either. Very disappointed *Update* App inexplicably has started working again. When App is working as I mentioned it's great. I'd give 5 stars if you could scan bar code of food products instead of manually typing in."
"no manual input and no edit is poor. also you cannot edit heart rate zones, would be great if you could add sports like HIIT and stand up paddle boarding clearly you have very little bandwidth for connecting with Strava and other such apps normally takes 12hrs to transfer the date. finally no website browser version .hope you get my drift the app is good and stable just needs someone who actually does do sports to give you pointers on what is needed and not what you think we need"
Password problems Keeps saying update password. I update password but when I try to sign in says - update password. Going round in circles
"App was great till a week ago. Started get errors messages and turning off during my runs, then started closing second after going into the app. I sent the error reports but did not recieve any feedback. I ended up deleting the app and reinstalling, which has seemed to work. Lost all my info, but willing to give this one more shot."
"Using with Galaxy Watch 4 since 10 months ago. When clicking on Body Composition lately ALL data has disappeared. History, most recent, fat %, lean muscle, targets etc, EVERYTHING is gone. It just displays and empty screen. Other users experience the same issue. Samsung keeps sending an unhelpful generic response to call a free number, but not free for me since I don't live in North America."
"Well, after several years of using this app, and changing 3 of their smartwatches, it's time to move on. Especially considering how unstable this app became, literary crashing in a mater of seconds, with ""close app"" notification popping up. Samsung literary pushed me away and now I'm a proud owner of Garmin watch with way longer battery life and stable app with a hell of a more information than Samsung can ever dream off. Bye Samsung, this was just first step towards leaving your ""ecosystem""."
"I have the widget on the home screen on my phone so I can track the steps. A push to break a record or to hit that next 1000 mark. I would like to see a 'Flights of stairs' category added and also maybe a 'Night shift"" mode, where the step count does not reset at midnight but at mid day. These additions would result in a 5 star rating."
"I dont know why but all the online thinks that you can do in the app does not work, but everything else does. I cant look at notices, do programs , add friend. It shows network error when i am connected to the internet . Please help! *Edit* Thanks a lot everything works all right now, thanks for quick responce Samsung ."
I'm honestly really disappointed that the Samsung health and fitbit apps aren't compatible. I'm not sure if that's on fitbit or if it's Samsung but the fact that I don't carry around my phone constantly nor do I hold it with me while I'm on the treadmill at the gym and I can't sync the two apps to show my actual steps. Maybe it's greed because you want people to break and buy a Samsung tracker but it sucks. There's also no way to get steps from adding in my workout manually like someone suggests. It adds to my active minutes in a day but doesn't contribute to steps.
"I loved this app, terrific for tracking my walks/workouts. But this morning I was forced to allow phone call access and worse, 2 step verification, to be used every time I access the app! These changes should be optional. I've stopped the app and will find another way to track my workouts. Too bad. Samsung, please re-think this!"
"I like the app, but it would be nice if it had a tab to log other medication besides diabetic and blood pressure meds. Also the math under the weight management tab is confusing. I work on an over night rotation and can't adjust my hours of awake time so just as I'm getting ready for dinner at 0100 and I'm about 200 calories under it resets at midnight and now I'm 700 calories over. Other than that it's been a very helpful app."
"The pedometer is so inaccurate, it's scary. It doesn't always record steps and the discrepancy between and another pedometer app is sometimes more than 1000 steps. Very disappointing. Not worth it. After doing the recommendations of clearing the cache and a force stop, the problem is still not fixed. Disappointing app."
"Was really useful, until they removed the visualisation of calories in vs calories burned. This app was actually one of the reasons I stuck with Samsung through Notes 8, 9 and 10. The changes made here helped me decide NOT to get a Note 20, and to look to another brand when my 10 needs to be replaced. Nice work, Samsung!"
Step tracker now seems to be tracking steps not taken. Woke up to 1500 steps for the day when both the watch and phone were on chargers all night.
"I really enjoy this app. I wish when there was a flange in my sleep there was a comment section where I could log things such as ""I didn't sleep well, but my period is due the next day"" so I could look at a glance and see if I could find a pattern."
there was an update and it suddenly stopped working and wont let me sign in. gives me an error code telling me i have to sign back into the app (which i did) and after i tell it to do the app setup stuff i cant log in because of this sign in error. it was working fine earlier today! so dumb. great way to lose users of your app. im not calling you guys to fix it why would i waste more of my time if you break something that was working
"I used it before on my phone during the beginning of the first UK lockdown to keep me fit, and it sure did! I was more aware of what I was eating because I would record it, I recorded all the exercises I did because I wanted to do well for burning calories every day. Only thing stopping from giving 5 stars is it's not the most accurate way for measuring steps however overall if you are truthful to the app, you can monitor being healthy in a positive way and stay in ""good"" for calorie intake."
I used this app few years ago and it had option to auto-fill meals and also the option to add foods from local stores and brands you can actually get here even when not using finnish language as setting. Now I have picked the app again after buying new phone and active watch; When I use my phone in English language its all just brand I have never heard of so the feature becomes very trivial.. and the option to auto-fill meals is also no where to be seen. Please make food list based on location.
"Excellent app and monthly challenges are great, the app syncs with the watch almost immediately and the monthly challenges are great, the challenges encourage you to walk further to complete. I drink more water than I used to and log it on the app, I also keep track of my weight and have just started logging my food. Most exercises are trackable, there is also an exercise programme to take part in."
"The sleep tab needs a lot of more graphs, analysis and options. Missing Sleep Score daily graph. Missing snore time daily graph. Missing Sleep Evaluation (1 to 5 stars) daily graph. Missing Sleep Consistency expanded view, beyond one week. More holistic options to help sleep like relaxing options, night timeouts and reminders, smart morning alarm (gradual), etc. All this are important to analyze if the sleep patterns are getting better or worse."
Great sleep tracker if you have a suitable Samsung watch.
"Like others have observed, a recent update now forces users to give the app phone dialing permissions and access to your contacts. No thanks, Samsung. As a workaround, users should go find version 6.10.5.031 from apklibrary or apkpure which was the last stable version before this ""feature"" was added. Then after installation, go into Google Play to prevent the app from auto-updating. It works just fine."
"It's annoying when you cant remove apps you dont need or use. Especially when Samsung makes a phone that doesn't have an sd slot. The phone storage is full and it would make sense to offload unnecessary apps, but some apps don't allow it. I enjoy a frugal minimalist lifestyle and this app is cluttering up my phone. I also don't appreciate being ""forced"" to keep an app I will never use. After I buy the phone and pay the bill, it should be MY decision, not the manufacturer. It's controlling üò°"
"2 months and 2 updates in.STILL Terrible at tracking. STILL records running when I walk. 1.5 hour walk = 13 minute run according to this app. Recorded 43 min of 'walking' over 4.5km when I was biking 15km. STILL TO THIS DAY, no ability to correct the app when it's wrong. Auto start/stop when tracking workouts just stops for no reason and starts up at random. It just. Doesn't. Work. Constantly trying to restart it or fix it interrupts your workout. More of a headache than what it's worth."
I have been using this application for quite sometime but from past few days the application seems to be creating issues. It pauses the workout automatically in the app and a voice message is generated. I have uninstalled and downloaded the latest version of the app in my new phone but still facing the same challenge. Currently I am using MI note 8 Pro please suggest some steps to solve the issue.
"Update: I have waited a while now because I thought Samsung would be able to solve this issue. Did a 14km night run yesterday and the app stopped responding after one km. At the end... It told me...total distance 1 km and average pace 78km!! No more tries, uninstalling this junk, better apps out there. After the recent update, this app doesn't calculate the distance anymore. Now I run 10km at a pace of 5:30 but it tells me that I have a 25 min average pace per km. And only records 2 km!"
I enjoy this app alot. Have used it for my weight loss journey. I really miss however the option of editing my own foods. There's only 100 you can add but I was able to delete some and add new ones but that seems impossible now. As a foodie I have more than just 100 foods I consume because of various brands and would like to be able to edit some options that I cannot find in your food search. Fix this please.
"I love the app in use with my Galaxy watch, it have many more functions than apps like Strava and is a good all-in-one app. The one issue is it extremely low-balls calories burnt! 5km runs tracked on my watch suggest not even 100kcal per mile!? Yet if I manually enter it the app suggests nearly 200kcal. It looks like with the watch, it doesn't take bodyweight or heart rate into consideration. If that was fixed, genuinely would be a 5 star app."
"stop redesigning the widget for the app! You make it worse and worse every time and the numbers get smaller and smaller and harder to see. I don't need to have the stupid green progress bar there either, the green is annoying and ruins my phone's general aesthetic. Return the widget design to how it was, no progress bar and just big numbers that I can clearly and quickly take note of at a glance and know how many steps I have."
"I use it mainly for the Weight Management feature, but after the recent update (in August), it has been removed. A lot of people used the feature, and are confused by why they would remove the part of the app, that makes it better than others. It really sucks, because you become dependent on this stuff... I'm just glad I didn't buy a samsung watch to use with the app yet."
"As of March 29th this app no longer works on my Galaxy S8 following the latest major Android firmware update. App still tracks steps, but crashes every single time you try and open it. Clearing cache doesn't revolve the issue, nor does reinstalling it. App also now uses a staggering amount of battery life despite not functioning. Please look into this, I liked using this app the last few years!"
"app keeps asking to setup and sync accounts with terms and conditions screen everytime i open the app. also keep getting errors after following prompts then get the error code and can't open the app, Please fix it asap. I've been using the app for 5+ years with no problems until today error code Can't set up app Server error occurred. Try again later. (0x2C#0#null) Retry"
"Gets the job done but color scheme is rough. It's helped me track calories in and out, exercise, weight and menstrual cycle. The biggest issue with this app is since the update, the color scheme has changed. It makes it IMPOSSIBLE to see the nutrition intake summary. The greens are so close in color that I have to strain my eyes to tell the difference in carbs/fat/protein. Also wish it had more features, like better bmi chart and estimated date for weight goal. Overall, most used app I have."
"After the new update I can't use the app. I'm stuck in a 2 step verification process loop. Seems to be a bug. Plus new update requires too many permissions. Is there a way to revert back to the old app?... Samsung Health, are you even reading these reviews? People are saying the 2 step authentication process isn't working for them at all. We are stuck on the authentication page even after entering our number and the code. Your genetic answer to everyone experiencing this is not helping."
"Yes, I agree with everyone else's reasoning for getting rid of this app because of the 2-step verification process. Their reasoning of the together feature doesn't fly with me. We as users of our own devices should be able to opt out of any feature we don't want to use. When we raise concerns, Samsung responds back with we need this access to provide an optimal experience for you just doesn't sound legit. The app worked fine without you needing these permissions to begin with. Why change?"
"This is my 2nd review. The 1st has been deleted - why?? This app isn't working anymore. I cannot even access it! I lost all of my records ! Of course, there is no one to assist ! I can only guess they elected to use their time deleting poor reviews, instead of assisting their members ! Utter nonsense ! Switching to another app ? And, I won't be far off switching to another make too. What the heck !! Isn't an update suppose to fix issues NOT create new ones !!"
"I am very disappointed to learn that I cannot import or use data from other (better) apps, nor can I use my existing devices with this app. I downloaded this because my medical aid doesn't integrate with Google fit, but since I can't import data from Google fit, and all my devices use fit (not to mention Google assistant support), I think I'll just leave my benefits in the name of ease of use. It also shows a persistent notification, and drains the battery like crazy. Worthless to me"
"Its a good tracking app, but lacks some really useful features. Like altering your created foods or even deleting them from your list another words when you create a recipe and forgot something you can't adjust it it would be so good to fix that issue. That's my biggest issue. Otherwise I really like the sleep function and step counter."
"I find most of this app to be very beneficial. I wish I could customize a little more. Overall, this is helpful and easy to use ."
"As a formerly devoted couch potato, I love this app!! It tracks my movement, food, sleep, water, goals and trends. A real one-stop app that takes care of it all. Happily, unlike another app I tried, the pedometer is accurate, it can tell the difference in a pass'n play scrabble game and walking. üòÅ I've been using this for a month or two and will continue, it's working!"
It stops working and widget of step counter disappear.. i have to gain add widget to start step counter. Disappointed.
"The app was amazing until the most recent update. It's not accurate anymore. I wore my phone on me for a walk. I took a route that I've down countless times that's about 5 miles. At the end it recorded less than 2 miles of walking, thus recording significantly less steps than before the update. I wish I could un-update it."
"Mileage tracking is way off. Starting using this app a couple months ago, seemed a little off compared to my last tracking app. I was riding faster and the mileage seemed a little off, now it's out of control. Barely around the corner from my house and had me at 2.5 miles. Then I rode around a park, probably quarter mile, it added 5 miles to my count. Not worth using anymore."
"I used to love this app until the new I update now I can't join any challenges and I can't compare the calories that I consume compared to the calories that I have burned. Please bring back these items and make it so I can join challenges again so that i am able to keep motivated on this weight loss journey. Also, my watch which is also a samsung is having issues the battery is draining really fast üò™ and not tracking properly with the steps, sleep mode,etc If these get fixed I will give it a 5."
"Cannot set up my Samsung health account. As soon as i get to the page to sync my phone with Samsung health it crashes. I've tried restarting my phone, deleting and reinstalling the app and nothing works. It always says ""Can't set up the app. This service is temporarily unavailable. Try again later."" I try again later and it still doesnt work. What's the point of having a Samsung gear fit2 if you cant use Samsung health to track everything??"
"I like this app. It does what it should, I guess. I like the fact that it links with my watch and the my scales. The step counter seems to be the most accurate I've come across so far, though this does not say a lot because I'm not very tech-savvy I like measuring my stress-level too, though I can't say whether it's accurate or not. (I can never remember to measure it when I'm actually stressed). And I LOVE the monthly challenge and the community!"
Step counter logs false steps while driving. Samsung app support won't acknowledge this flaw and nothing is being done to fix it.
Not syncing with other apps as it did before
"I used to really love this app, I even bought a Samsung galaxy watch so the stats were more accurate. I'm so disappointed that the weight management feature has been removed (which was the main reason I bought the watch) I might as well use my old fit bit watch which pairs up with my fitness pal. Really disappointing. I'm actually thinking about switching over to apple as I'm due for an upgrade"
App has been great but now all of a sudden my calories counted on my galaxy watch are way out. I'm not sure if it's the app or the watch. I've found no fix to this issue that many people seem to be having. Watch is saying I've burnt over 6000 calories today which I most definitely have not. I've tried everything to get it to fix itself and hasn't. If it doesn't won't be using the watch or the app anymore
Not sure how I was supposedly sleeping but still managed to get 2000+ steps in those few hours. Has been like that the past couple of days.
"Used this for 5 years, tracking weight and sleep per month evolution, which is key for my health. Since the narcissist UX switch to this new layout, I can't have that perspective anymore, it feels like a huge let down. Im about to change phone and watch (currently frontier) and if not fixed by end of April, will switch to Apple. Yes, cos of the visionary sitting at your design hub. Tell him I say hi üòò EDIT: in a month span, they correct and improved the functionality: good job, I'm back."
Can't open the app always returning this error 0x2C#7#1024
"Worked fine for years until it suddenly demanded I set up 2 point verification, Samsung accounts etc. Very frustrating. Not worth my time. Also, suddenly I have to have a Samsung account to use the app and in attempting to get that I'm told my browser is no good and I have to download Samsung internet. Shove it!"
"decent app with lots of options but limited in a variety of ways. for example, you cant compare similar/duplicate runs/cycles like you can on a quite a few other apps. you cant view historic fitness - e.g. miles/steps per month during the year. connection and syncing woth strava (THE best fitness app) is poor and inconsistent. activity options on accompanying gear app are limited. samsung needs to realise that the world uses many other apps for health and fitness an dramatically improve this."
"Hi, I wish it was possible to easily pause Samsung's step counting for example from the notification area, since it keeps counting when one is driving, too, which makes the results inaccurate. Another important feature, which it lacks is to change the step counts back to zero, when one has forgotten to pause the step counting."
"Can't even access the app! I loved Samsung Health since I first tried it out. In 2019, they changed the layout, and my review dropped to 3 Stars, because the app became less user-friendly. I updated today, and agreed to the new terms, and 2-Step Verification (which I should be allowed to choose, or not choose). The app won't move past the 2-step verification page. Essentially, I have NO app available to me right now. I'll improve my rating when I can access the app features again."
New to the Watch 4 and love it so far. One thing I can't figure out is why the ECG is on my watch but not on my app. It disappeared and I can't figure out how to get it back.
"So far I have had no issues with the app, and it works well for what I use it for, mostly blood sugar readings and a workout timer. I just have one request. Please make the app compatible with more devices. It's kinda annoying that the app works on my Samsung Edge 7, but it won't work with my Samsung Galaxy Tab A. So if you could make that a reality, that would be awsome."
This new version is poor as compared to earlier version which was crisp and organised neatly. This version looks old with those cartoon fonts. Many items are missing from the food list. The dashboard is like a list. please reinstate the older version. Atleast include the full food menu from the older version.
"I have used this app for longer then I can remember and have enjoyed & appreciated the hard work ot take in creating such an app, but since the last update I have found it harder to use. I miss the features that have been removed and have lost feature connections to my smart watch. For the first time in years I am Considering looking at other health apps."
I am getting sexually explicit invites appear through this app. I have had two in the last few days. I believe this app to be hacked. Is anyone else experiencing this? I have tried to contact the developers through various channels but yet to get a suitable contact reply. Edit update: thank you for replying Samsung Electronic. This so far does not help me. The invitation appears to come from someone who is not on my friends list in the app? How is this possible if I have not added them?
"The app is required for Discovery linking of devices however the step counter is disfuctional. We compared three devices side by side for a week and found steps calculated as 2000 for the day (my device), 6000 (friends device) and 12000 (watch counter). The app also closes itself and then does not record steps, walked over 2km it picked up a 100m of that. There is no feedback available on the app itself either."
"Was worth 5 stars in my opinion, but noted that now it lacks some features that it used to have. These include a heart rate monitor. My samsung watch still has the application, but now does not record my heart rate at all. It also has a problem with barometric pressure, and doesn't read that any longer either. Wondering if it's the age of my watch, or just a bad update, that stopped these functions working....Please Advise...üôÇ"
"The interface is quite nice as is the ability to track food and now see dietary info. However I am extremely disappointed that you can no longer even manually add pulse information and are forced to buy a gear watch. I have checked with Samsung tech support and they (politely) informed me that the feature had been removed from smartphones. Seriously? Samsung, you're supposed to be better than this. Until the ability to manually enter my info is restored my rating will stay at 1 star."
bout a new sj7 prime last year... and from day one I was not able yo use the app as it kept saying that my phone wad rooted I really wanted to try the app as my friend says it's amazing I've been loyal to Samsung and honestly it's frustrating. I expected better... I have reset my phone 7 times in the span of the year due to numerous issues where the screen would go blank and download manager etc. I can deal with that but I tried removing the knox it can't be done! urgh! I have reached my quota!
"I used to love the Samsung health app I used it to record a variety of data for my dr visits. I was very disappointed that you removed the oximeter. I was able to find a work around to get an older version. However, with the last update it was removed again and now you have managed to prevent the workaround to be downloaded. I'm very disappointed. I don't understand why you would remove it in the first place."
This app is the best health app I've ever wanted to install but lately after updating the app is not working normal always failed to record my exercise dayly and even weekly.
"Can you explain why the heart rate zones change for the same walk. For example, when I get home and press finish on the app,  it shows that I have done over 6 minutes of anaerobic exercise and 23 minutes of aerobic. Then when I look again later it has downgraded all the exercise I did so it says 0 anaerobic and only 2 minutes of aerobic. This happens regularly. Which zones are correct and why does it change? Apart from this I like the app."
"I used to use this application all the time to track my workouts. After the update Samsung requires access to phone, contacts, and management of all files. I refuse to give permission to my files and contacts. There should be an option to opt out of the features which require these permissions"
"Latest update does not use default font size (I exercise without my reading glasses, so I am unable to read the very small font size). As others have said the update is a step backwards; lots of white spaces that previously had useful info in colour. Have to scroll to find info that previously was visible without scrolling. Now looking for another app to replace this one that I have used for the past 3 years. EDIT; I re-installed version 5.17.2.009 and won't update again!"
"junk. 1st it won't open because ""for your security s health can't be opened on a rooted phone"" whatever that means. then I update the app thinking that would fix it, nope now i get ""unauthorized changes have been made to your phone, contact customer service"" I dont care enough about this app to call someone about it. this was a good app. I'm not sure what changed, but it wasn't the right thing to change."
My app doesn't differentiate between when am walking or in a moving vehicle. So the daily steps counter becomes too manual. I have to always remember to switch it on and off when necessary. I think you can make it to automatically detect and differentiate when in a moving vehicle eg by speed. There is no way i can walk at 100kph etc
Great app but needs integration with shoe gears. They should add some features to add them also. My second proposition is to enable sharing training results with personal trainer. I understand this samsung watches are not just sports focus but that feature can help us a lot. I am using Samsung health but the fair integration with other training apps makes it difficult.
"My daily fitness tracker. Have it linked to my Garmin ANT+ chest strap heart rate monitor. Track my morning workout (push-ups, leg raises, extensions). Love it for tracking my runs. Would like to see a ""stretching"" activity. Great food tracker! PLEASE add magnesium (very important) to nutrient list. Also after last update, the notifications bar (""connecting, detecting"") appears over the start bar - prevents tapping start until it disappears. Please put it back in the corner."
"Old grid layout was really good. It gave lot of information is quick glance. Earlier there used to seperate grid for each exercise. This is what I miss the most in new layout. Also in food section, many foods have just disappeared over a while. Unable to find many over time."
"Absolute rubbish....!!. Steps NEVER count properly. Read up on a few threads online about the same problem, many many people having the same problem !. I have a brand new S10 and would expect it to work effectively !. I have checked the app settings, the power settings etc and chaged it not to go to sleep, works for a while and then stops.I have also uninstalled and reinstalled the app.The only solution I found that works is restarting the phone, but even then after a while it stops again, have had to restart the phone at least twice a day, which I am not willing to keep doing to a new phone !!!. Even though I would walk a lot daily during this lockdown, the app only registers about 400-800 steps daily. I have uninstalled the app and will never use it again, if it was possible to give it ZERO stars i would...!!!"
I've used this app for many years now and this latest update completely is horrible! Sleep tracking is way off and you can no longer edit or record manually the accurate data.. it glitches to whatever it wants so I've ended up having to delete my sleep data the last 3 days. There's no way to undo the update! Also the steps are now astronomically different than actual steps taken. They don't register anymore! Please get rid of this update!
Heart rate no longer showing in work out. This data is used by my medical aid and is required. Anyone know of another app or should I stop using Samsung products completely?
"I am having the same problem as others have described. Unable to get past two step verification, terrible. Am considering returnung watch and going back to Fitbit. It broke every few months but at least it worked some of the time ! I followed all the steps as described signed in, entered numerical code provided etc.. and it still didn't work."
"Sleep tracking needs an edit function!!! I moved from a Fitbit Charge 2 to the Galaxy Active 2. My Fitbit recorded my sleep so accurately, including sleep and wake times. If it had incorrect times while I was really still, I could edit the time. The health app/Active 2 watch is not nearly as accurate with sleep and wake times and you cannot edit it. Edit: Lowering my rating after the update. The sleep pie charts make absolutely no sense and you still can't edit your sleep times. Frustrated!!!!!"
"This app was excellent the best I have used, covered all bases, until the recent update. Now can't record all my meals these have been dropped from six to four? I have just spent 10 minutes trying to input my training sessions from today unsuccessful, the nutrients tracking board has changed why? This really was a truly great app, worked seamlessly from phone to my Samsung watch ‚åö to state I am disappointed is an understatement! Hero to Zero over night, update to improve not make worse."
"The step counter has become glitchy in recent days since update. Sometimes it doesn't count at all. Sometimes it will try to ""catch up"". Sometimes it will work if location services is off."
"Completely useless without a Samsung phone. I have had my Samsung watch for years and enjoyed tracking my sleep/excersise on a previous phone but that seems impossible on a phone that isn't a Samsung device as it asks me to install Samsung's internet and set it as my default browsing option in order to use the app. You shouldn't have to amend software settings to install a simple fitness app. In short Good app, do not bother if you don't have a Samsung phone."
been using the app pair with galaxy watch. everything is work just fine aside from having the floor level counter which counts less than the actual. been doing stair exercises going up and down a 4 story building for about more than 10 times but it only gives me 8 floors as total count. but it ok as long as it tracks my heart rate. one thing if only you could add a time interval guide for running not just the frequency guide. just hoping.. peace..
Samsung is doing what Microsoft did with Windows Phone. Took a beautiful app and made the update a retrograde. I much prefer the previous version. This update is ugly. Having all the info there on on one screen was great in the previous dashboard. This design language of. The previous version fit in with the overall touchwiz look and feel and other Samsung apps. Not liking this. Wish there was a downgrade option
"It seems like the last update was a bad choice, now it doesn't count steps at all and I've tried everything and I don't see how asking access to the phone calls can help to improve the service. And my phone is Samsung but it doesn't seem to work that well like it did on my old phone samsung. Update: it's working some better now, had to Uninstall it for almost a full day and it restore my data from some time ago."
"Last update of the app didn't exactly improve the experience. The history view is now harder to screen, since it shows now per week. I've been having also issues with my Samsung watch, hardly detects when I'm cycling. Most of the times I need to add the information manually in the app. Overall experience is not great."
"coupled with the Galaxy watch, I LOVE it.. it tracks everything, then presents it back in a really useful way, so I know if I am doing enough, or not, to reach my goals.. the watch even figures out if I am swimming breaststroke, backstroke or front crawl, all of which is presented in the app with speed/ rate data.. I really recommend this ap, in conjunction with the Galaxy watch..."
"Please add to Sleep: Last night, my Samsung watch skipped over the first 2h of sleep and also recorded my sleep quality as 73%.. there is no way.. I tossed and turned all night. I get that this isn't the app's fault but where the app could improve is a) allowing edits to the time slept (when you select edit from the menu it lets you do nothing more than delete the whole sleep entry.. there is also a separate delete menu option) , b) create notes section (I would use this almost every day)."
"As someone who is trying to lose weight for health reasons, I found the Weight Management feature very helpful for monitoring the balance between calories burnt and taken in. Also the caffeine tracker to make sure I don't consume too much caffeine. Now they're gone. This is a real downer for me. Please bring them back! Anyone who doesn't want them can just remove them from their home-screen."
"Really disappointed that the Co2 measurement has been removed as a seperate monitor. Although levels can be checked via the Stress monitor, it does not provide a seperate graph. This function is really important if you need to keep a record. I used this function as an indicator for checking my peak flow. Please can you bring the Co2 monitor back, or provide a graph within the Stress monitor. Thank You."
"Like most features and links well with gear sport. Step counts is pretty accurate as is GPS tracking. Challenges are useful but obviously being fixed by users for reasons that are quite beyond me. In response to Samsung it's not a problem with the app but the fact that users are gaming the challenges by recording over 150,000 steps per day. Pretty unlikely."
"The app used to be incredibly useful, but now they got rid of the weight management side for no reason. That was an established feature that worked flawlessly. Before I used to track everything, now I basically only use to estimate how many more steps I need for the day. Please bring weight management back!!!!"
"29.11.2020. 1 star. Such a poor app at the moment. Brilliant when it works but I've been waiting 2 weeks for the developers to respond and fix it. Won't open on my new phone, wouldn't sync on my old phone before I changed and then deleted all my data on my watch when I tried to sync my watch to my new phone. Why doesn't it auto sync? Such poor development from such a big company."
"The app is starting to work a lot better, with the easy access side panel for sync and etc. 1 last problem is that the app consumes too much battery, developers should be aware of this. Another is to allow us to transfer Google Fit data to Samsung Health. (Redmi Note 7 Global) I'm definitely a very big fan of Samsung Health since it's launch. Keep up the good work Samsung!"
"Permissions required: none. ""To use this feature, you need to allow permissions in settings."" Um...those two things don't go together. The latest update essentially bricks the app unless calls permission is enabled and therefore by extention renders any samsung smart watch useless. Fix it! P.S. Don't reply with 'you can contact us via the Contact Us Menu: Samsung Health > Settings > Contact Us.', I can't contact you, I can't access the app!"
"I am so disappointed, I've purchased the A51 and originally the app worked great, now all of a sudden the heart rate monitor has disappeared, steps are not recorded correctly and this app has just become a space waster, I was really impressed with the app and have tried lots of ways to fix these issues to no avail. Would have been 4 stars without these issues."
"Even though I can see the map and route taken during my run on the watch, I can't get the map to display in the phone app. Having searched this issue on the web it would appear to be quite common. Having recently purchased a Samsung watch and using some of their apps it doesn't make me want to return to owning a Samsung phone"
Not working right since last update. Heart rate and stress readings keep giving out about finger placement. Never had a problem before Update: worked since the cache clear. cheers. Update 2: Seems to have an issue again. I think it's related to the Otterbox case shape around the sensor and some recent changes?
"The app is amazing. And the best thing is all this awesome content is free. Although there are some improvements needed, but it's overall a good experience. It would be better if it records sleep accurately and there is option if i can record sleep in divided intervals."
"Edit: Fixed! Thanks. Previous: I was using it for months just fine. Today I had to update the app and now it doesn't work. It asked me for a login account, couldn't find me so I created one (don't remember if I had to create one initially). After that it asked me to give all the permissions access so I could agree and move on. Then it asked me to do 2-step login and when I opted out, the screen said error/retry. Then when I did try to opt in, after getting a code, it said error again."
"I am Samsung user and I would like to use Samsung ecosystems even more, however I found that the core application (Samsung Health) cannot compete with the core apps from Garmin, Polar, etc. I particularly don't like: 1. The app is intuitive and poorly organized. It is a good snapshot of daily statistics, but any analysis of historic data is complicated and not so much useful (for example, I don‚Äôt see possibility to analyise particular activity between two dates). The visualizations and consolidation of the historical data is not good as well. 2. There is only smartphone app, without web-based interface. Again, any analysis of the historic data is a pain if done through the phone only. 3. There is no possibility to edit activities. If I do exercise on an Elliptical device, I cannot add milage that I did during the exercise, but instead I need to add a new activity and add milage only. Also, there is no possibility to rename the exercise. 4. There is no possibility to export .gpx that includes heart rate information, but only a route. I think Samsung made a very big step forward with Samsung Galaxy 4 watch to be a very good health and activity tracker as well as daily watch, but without proper ecosystem that supports the device, it will not make a breakthrough. Until then, I need to use two devices ‚Äì Garmin as activity tracker and Samsung Galaxy 4 as a daily watch for simple activities."
"I was one of the many happy users - until the new privacy policy requested access to make calls! I'm not accepting that - so have been unable to use the app, which was a real shame. Off to find another app. I understand that the phone permissions is for the 'together' feature - which I have no intention of using, wish it was an optional feature fir those that do want to use it."
"I have been using this app for years to track my health and help lose weight etc. Since the last update, however, I get an error message about my phone being rooted (it isn't) and the app won't open. Until they fix this, no dice. UPDATE 2022 SH works again but with the new phone (S22) I don't have the sensors for heart rate and o2 sat. Not a problem, as I use a BP cuff and pulse oximiter anyway but there is no way to manually edit the O2 sat! That is disappointing."
Cannot edit/trim workout activities from my Galaxy 4 watch and Samsung phone. Unfortunately will have to switch back to Garmin watch and app. Too bad.
"While the overall functionality is ok, the app seems to struggle to stay stable. I have recently started using it again on a daily basis & I'm mostly disappointed with the workout detection when connected to a Samsung Gear Fit smartwatch. The module keeps missing several minutes worth of GPS and speed data for my daily walks & today's (2019-07-30) results were the most ridiculous where it calculated that I burned only 130 calories after a 10km walk during a 1 hr and 48 min long workout, plz fix!"
"When I walked for say 30-40 minutes, it earlier appeared as Exercise. However, since last one month or so, it does not appear in exercise. Further, in the main screen active time is also not recorded correctly. For example, today I walked for 40 minutes, it still says 20 minutes."
My needs are fairly simple & used it primarily to track my walking trips. I don't remember it needing certain permissions to use but now it's requiring too many permissions. It does not need access to make & manage calls. I don't/won't do collaborative routines so phone should be optional. Same with accessing the camera...make it optional.
Poor Calorie Tracking. Off by hundreds of calories sometimes.
"This new update sucks! The wigdet is now white! With no option to choose black or transparent. The old Samsung Health app had the option to choose black, white, transparent for its widget. Now its only white! I wish it also had a night mode on the app. But the most important thing is the white widget that looks out of place on my phone's black wallpaper! Give us back these options, until then I'll change my rating and review!"
"If not the last update, I would give 10 stars!But last update have removed weight management section - such a huge disappointment!!! I have just started to LOVE this section as it really works and motivates you! :( please bring this section back!!! Also, many times I strat using Food section, but then I stop as it takes TOO much time to put all the ingredients and you can't find many dishes, and more importantly - you can't create ones, which could be a fantastic feature!"
I thought the updates are always comes with an added features and more user friendly interface. But in this update lots of regular features gone away which were very good for tracking individual progress . It may be there some where but the new interface is notbat all user friendly and really bad. The main features of tracking my map pace activity from my samsung gear 3 is gone and it doesn't show any map foot print in location map after finishing the work out. Previous versions far better'
Most of the data collected by the watch 4 is pure fantasy and this app is about as useful as a chocolate fire guard.
"After the last update requesting access to all my private data, totally not related with health, I am not using it anymore. I agree with all the users having the same experience and feedback. If not reverted back to the previous version soon I will definitely delete this app. And please don't give the same robotic answer to this review, as did with similar hundreds of them. I do not need it, we all need the problem to be fixed."
"After recent update started asking for permissions to access contacts, phone, location etc. Sorry to say but I am not going to be using the app any more. Samsung calls this update provides a ""better service and user experience"" but it should be optional. Instead, the app can no longer be used without them."
"Excellent. I love the way you can input what you're eating and track everything youre doing. However, it doesnt take into account the exercise you have done that day. It would be nice if it automatically adjusts your calorie target, once it detects steps or other exercise. Otherwise Very Good app."
"The set up process is too long! The app doesn't send phone verification messages no matter how often I try. I've even been blocked due to multiple attempts of trying to get text verification. So, I can't even get past the initial set up. I can't even use the app! Most disappointing. A huge waste of time. I have to look for another health app."
"Worst app i have ever used for running. Audio guide is almost useless. The coach is not dlexible at all. You cant really set your own time/pace for the run. Audio guide is interupting all the time. (Such as great pace, too slow/fast etc.). Furthermore app doesnt work with the SAMSUNG Gear fit 2 pro. Not recommended."
"It has been a while since I've used this app but I reinstalled it recently and very disappointed that they have removed the weight management section. Essentially all this app is useful for now is a pedometer and possibly as a manually recorded meal record that gives you no real insight. Using the Samsung watch, the app used to be great, when it would give real info on calories burned vs consumed and kept you on track. If this function was brought back I would change the rating."
Come on Samsung. Make it easier on people who like to track their food and implement barcodes scans into your app.
"It is brilliant app I just hope the setting didn't change. It was very encouraging to hear SLOW DOWN and KERP UP THIS PACE and you burnt such and such of Calories etc.... The Audio we used to hear while running is gone now and , it feels like something is short something is missing from the app. I hope they will bring back the old Audio Setting because it was very encouraging and you feel like you ve been monitored so closely and that what you need."
"Well just started running again and everything has changed I could listen to my YouTube playlist whilst running and the app would coach me , track my distance speed ect whilst I run now it doesn't do anything so I don't know no stats how far I've run nothing...doesn't even show my workout after I've finished so haven't got a clue what I've done, what is the point!!!! Will delete and find something else.....what is wrong with you people.."
"I was enjoying this app until the latest update. Much like many others, calories burnt is now a default measure as is daily active minutes along with steps. None of these can be set to a personal goal either now or historically which now means all of my past achievements look like failures and the inability to separate these 3 distinctly different measurements is infuriating. Rather than a stock response to contact customer services which has been given to most people, maybe act on feedback!!!"
"I did love this until the latest update where the weight management was removed! The app is now useless as it just logs your input. There is no managing at all. Please bring back the weight management feature!!! It was a 5 star prior to the changes! Oh, and the 'floors' counter doesn't work either. Spoke with samsung and only result was that I had to reset my phone. Still not working."
"I enjoy the app and like that it sync with the scale, however I would love to see the food journal part be able to scan your products barcode to input your item, like similar apps are doing and is my only hesitation staying with the app then the other. It would save a lot of time and effort on recording your diet."
"The newest update is awful . I've been using this app for over 2 years . I've lost over 60 pounds and have maintained my weight since. Now they took away calorie manager and the bar that shows protein,fat and carbs is all one color instead of multicolored like it use to be. Please fix this."
"Not useful for running, it does not provide elevation gain (and/or drop). 3 things needed to determine a run: distance, time, and how hilly. One cannot get the last one with this app. I can't really buy another Samsung watch until the app is improved in this aspect. Love the watches, but don't use because of this app. Added: Your response of 9/13/21 does not seem responsive. Added Running Coach on phone but my run histories still do not show elevation gains. Am I missing something important?"
"This used to be a fantastic app I would have given 5 stars. We made use of the 'weight management' widget like many others are saying in their reviews. It was simple and effective and has made a real difference to our diet and weight control over the last 6 months. Then suddenly its vanished along with some other useful features as part of an 'update'. Why remove the most useful features, whose brain wave was that?! I have absolutely no reason to use this app now and its extremely frustrating"
I live in South Africa Gauteng province so I won't be making that US call to customer care. I walk 7km at least 3 times a week. I do not deviate from the set route yet this app can give me readings between 4 - 8km AND it shows its own haywire GPS/maps (usually long straight lines) readings yet my data saver is always off and location is turned on. That means even its steps count is inaccurate. Been using it for almost 3yrs but this year I want the walks to be more focused instead of casual. Help
"I tried to count calorie but then Malaysian local delicacies not updated, example I could'nt found roti canai. Try to add calorie manually also not available."
Generally an excellent app. Replaced a Garmin and I am much happier with the Samsung. Sincs well with my Samsung watch and love everything about it except....I really was not happy when the oxygen saturation capability was unexpectedly removed along with the data I had been storing. Now considering other watches and apps as replacement.
"EDIT- updated in Samsung app store, 19 November 2019. Finally working correctly. Not sure why Google is behind. *STILL not tracking sleep correctly. Used to like it for monitoring sleep. Since the recent update, something changed on the sleep tracking and it isn't accurate anymore. I still use it for the step and exercise tracking. I have an s3 frontier watch and note 8. Please fix the sleep tracking."
"App won't load past the initial loading screen...it just freezes and then you have to hit close all and sometimes you must reboot your phone even. I have tried clearing the cache- it failed!, I've tried clearing the data- it failed!. So I removed the app completely, even it's history in my play store and it still failed! . You say if I continue to have issues to call support and troubleshoot, but I've tried everything you would walk me through. Very disappointed and dissatisfied."
"Terrible update, now weight averaging has been removed. This is after weight management functionality was removed in a previous update. The app has become basically useless. Controlling weight is a long-term function of setting targets and observing averages, week-to-week, month-to-month and so on. A daily snapshot is basically useless."
"I love this app. Only problem I have is that workouts on fitness apps doesn't synchronize like it does on the Google Fit app. Or if you could atleast add a General workout under the excercise section where I can just insert time and the calories burned; it takes too much time selecting push-ups, sit-ups, jumping jacks, etc and inserting all workout information individually. Please find a solution for this, I really enjoy this app."
Love this app. I use the running tracker everytime I run and it's brilliant. I've started using the food tracker which is good however I would love it to have the ability to create your own meal and save it by adding different foods together as one of your own creations say like a homemade soup... rather than having to add the food ingredients individually everytime.
"Since the 2nd Nov the automatic step hasn't worked, I've had to switch to the workout mode, which doesn't work like it did, it keeps pausing. I'm seriously considering getting 1 of them watches. Please fix this bug sooner rather than later."
"Sleep tracker glitch - if you wake up in the middle of the night, the sleep tracker splits the data into 2 separate records. There is an edit function which i thought I would be able to combine the two records but the only edit function is to delete the record (???) How is that 'edit'. I could add a record in manually but then I lose the different sleep stages. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Sleep tracker on Fitbit app a lot better."
The new update got the app not working. It is no more tracking my movements or anything at all. I tried to make it work while location services on and off both ways but to no avail. I don't know if the issue is with my device only or there has been new setting updated for tracking steps for the day.
This app is not working it keeps saying server error can you help with this?
I primarily used the app to track my steps and weight. Steps are still tracked OK but the developers made the baffling decision of removing weekly/monthly trends for weight. Daily weight tends to fluctuate and doesn't paint a full picture in the same way weekly/monthly trends do. I will be switching to a new app until this is resolved.
"I'm a regular user of this app for last 6 years. However, after latest updates, it's not working properly. It doesn't count steps as used to be but work intermittently. Similarly the running distance is not accurate as used to be. May I request the team to fix the problem of this kind. Otherwise, it is an excellent app."
I had this app on my S6 and it worked perfectly. I have changed my phone to Samsung A70 and now can get all the aspects if the app that I love so much. The oxygen saturation and heart rate monitor have disappeared. I didn't realise until I wanted to use it. I have contacted Samsung and had a long chat (about 2 hours) with someone but to no avail. I am not happy at all.
"The food search doesn't show the shops and foods from where I live but on my friends phone it does. I have location and personalization enabled so I don't know what's wrong. Edit: I found the problem, the food search is based on the phone's language/country. I had UK English this whole time but I just changed it to my country's English (which I didn't think was an option since English isn't the main language here) and it works now."
It's showing the 50 steps count when I wake up in the morning. Step reading is wrong it should not increase the step while person is sleeping.
Useul app. I have been using various walking programmes available but distance measurements have lot of issues. Distance displayed in the app is very much higher than actual distance covered even after using location services. Faster the speed more distance is displayed e.g if actual distance covered is 3.84km app displays it as 5 to 6 km based on walking pace.
"my ONLY problem with this is the fact that it vibrates every. single. time. every single time its updating. very very very annoying. it updates maybe 4 times a day and i get the notifications, scroll down my menu and the app stays updating. i just had to get rid or the icon badge because kt was so frustrating. please fix this issue. i dont want to abandon this awesome app."
"I love seeing all of my information and having the menstruation portion as I always forget but since Christmas time, I'm no longer able to see ANY of my sleep records at all."
Again and again stopping automatically.
"not a great app at the moment, samsung need to listen to their customers. Firstly: the weight feature puts in a random height (mine says im 2'11"") making me massively obese. Secondly the food feature is all over the place, no matter what i eat it will always say 88% carbs consumed, macro nutrients has a default (i want to set my own nutrients goals) no barcode scanner to scan food quickly etc. it is a shame as i have a samsung phone and wearable, and i would love to be able to rely on samsung."
"Update: They just removed the weight management module. I am extremely disappointed. They should have kept it as an option. It was really working for myself and, I'm sure, a many number of people. I'm shocked that Samsung would remove it from their app. I urge them to reconsider and add it back as an option. App went from A++ to C in my book. //Weight management is a life saver! I love this feature and I hope they keep it. I have actually begun to lose weight after using it. A++"
"Works ok but has problems counting steps over short distances, like getting up, walking a dozen steps in a room, and then sitting down. It regularly doesn't detect any steps in this situation. May 16 2021 edit : The counting is so bad I downgraded to 6.15.6.001. So for anybody who wants accurate step counting and doesn't like Samsung having access to phone calls, downgrade ASAP, and when Samsung says permission for calls is needed for better experience, older versions provided me a better exp."
"I love the desing and the graphics. Sleep records are very beautifully created. I enjoy tracking my workouts with this app. sadly it doesn't sync with my new smart band from garmin and this needs to be changed. please, if possible, find a way to sync garmin connect app with Samsung health. That would be ideal."
the update says unauthorized changes were made to my phone. saying it has been rooted. no changes were made. so now I can no longer access this application. makes it hard to track progress with my Samsung watch now... my husbands is doing the same thing. I have tried shutting my phone off and uninstalling and then reinstalling. nothing.. not happy.
"Loading issue, data missing I've uninstalled the program, re installed the program, twice Finally got it to load, but lost all my data for the last while. Have to redo my profile as well Program worked well with my frontier till recently. Going to try this install. By the way, your response said to reply to the email sent to me yet the address is a no reply address! Wonderful."
"They have made the weight tracking option totally useless. It used to show a chart of my loss and a list of my different weights. It now only shows my current weight. This was literally the only reason I used this app and now I have discontinued use. For those looking for a replacement I really like ""Weight Loss Tracker & BMI Calculator"" with 4.8 / 5."
"Absolutely amazing application.(Note: Crucial Information Provided)Highly recommended, especially if you doesn't have any device to attach with. Not only a step counter but brings up challenges every months where you can stand globally. It takes you to discover a variety of work-out programs plus track your sleep, adding a bucket list of sleepy music and podcasts. Count calories, number of glasses of water & caffeine consumed, & track your other activities, added articles on women's health too."
"The latest update removing Weight Management has gutted the value of this app. Without it it's inferior to other apps on the market. Samsung really blew it with this one. Major disappointment. Weight Management was a unique gem. Bring it back. Good, could be better. The heart rate display is very basic. Would be great if you could display heart rate on Samsung watch. Watch isn't very accurate so I wear a Polar H10. Should be integrated with the watch."
"Crashes a lot. Doesn't display correctly. Looking at history in a horizontal calendar format is an absolute pain. Doesn't work with most tried party services like Fitbit and Google does... Maybe it's just the combination of Samsung apps in general plus my Galaxy watch... But other fitness health apps and accessories seems to work with one another seamlessly while Samsung Health refuses to communicate with Samsung accessories without glitching, crashing, or manually recording. Such a shame."
"It's ok, but with one big thing missing for me. Developers need to wake up to the fact that not all users are able bodied. Its high time the app included the ability to track wheelchair rolls as well as steps. Apple have been offering this option for a long time. If Apple had worked with my other tech it would have been the deal breaker that made me buy their product instead. Come on Samsung, it's about time you caught up with the competition!"
"I am using this app since 2017. And awarded 5 stars. But for last few months, I am facing regular problem. App stop counting steps abruptly during workout. Uninstsllec the app and reinstalled many times but all in vain. Sent feedback msg also through help option. But no one look into the matter. I think now no body is maintaining the app and attending issues. Due to lack of support, a good app is turning bad."
Great for keeping track of your walks messes up sometimes on the steps tho. Other than that works well.
"newest update is horrible!! wasn't having any issues and now it takes info from my galaxy watch active but doesnt list it for it to only get info for steps from the watch, the nutritional score amount are all messed up and it has the calories in the weight management at a super low amount even though it is set to exactly what it was before. I have already deleted and reinstalled it. might have to try again."
I've been using this app for at least 3 years. The new version is horrible. Samsung just made it nearly impossible to find what you're looking for to record specific exercise... it's a huge waste of time. The previous version was also time consuming but much more legible. Pretty sure I will delete this app.
"I like the app but I used to be able to modify my sleep time, now I can't and the recording is not accurate. I'm getting less sleep than is being recorded. This is something I really keep track of. Also I go up and down stairs literally all day but that's never recorded accurately either."
"Absolutely inaccurate calorie count for months on end. For low intensity activity like walking, I burn far more calories than when I do intense workouts with cardio and strength training. And every single time it displays 269 calories after the intense workout. That simply is not possible. Very disappointed with the app."
"Very good app in general but it falls short on the nutrition portion which is the most important part. Adding a barcode scanner so you can accurately add everything would make this app great. The food menu is decent but definitely lacking, leaving me to have to use My Fitness Pal for accurate meal tracking."
I have been using the app for almost 2 years now. I never had a problem with the features and updates. But today I tried looking for new programs to add to my daily routine but i just noticed that i couldnt find any more fitness programs on the app. I just updated my app to see if that would fix my problem and even restarted my phone. Maybe i missed any info about samsung health getting rid of the fitness program. If anyone could help me with this problem id really appreciate it.
"I do not find this app great. I had it installed before but I deleted it as it never seems to record my walking properly. It is the same now if I stop and chat to someone on my route it does not record any more walking, I cannot trust it. This app is hopeless, only records half/or less time I spend walking. It doesn't deserve a rating."
"Works good for tracking steps. Sometimes hS communication issues or lag between app and smart watch, or with competitors info in challenges. Good sleep tracker that logs phone down to phone up time or imports from the watch. Unfortunately if I read stories laying down, the watch count it as sleeping altering my scale. It has lots of other great features for a health app. It would be even better with more access to online recipes in the food aspect to make it easier to log diet information."
"i love this app! it provides a wide range of tracking info such as steps, floors climbed, food log, sleep tracking, water intake, weight management etc. there is plenty of info and the monthly step challenges are also great. it would be good to add stars or change the colour of the step tracker or floor counter when you reach your daily goal/target just as a pat on the back or added motivation. its the only thing i miss from the fitbit app"
"The UI is horrible and not user friendly after the latest update. Previously, all can be seem in one glance on the dashboard. After the update, have to scroll up and down to search for the item that I want. Please revert back the previous dashboard design."
"Been using for quite some time and have been very satisfied. Recently changed my phone and I have noticed that steps and km do not make sense. For example 5000 steps can not be only 1km. Samsung galaxy A70. I think it is a software bug so still going with 4 stars. By the way, all the settings for age, weight and height are correct"
This app was very good at first. I was able to track my daily steps which was the whole purpose of my getting the app up and running. Unfortunately there was an update and Samsung have updated their policy and are now asking me to put a verification code in. The issue that I am having now is that when ever I put the verification code in the app and it takes me back a step and doesn't allow me to proceed. I have been without access for 2 week now. Extremely frustrating.
"I really like the programmes on this app, but since the app updated today after I enabled it following a year or so of having it disabled, the Discover tab says ""No items"". Also, I would really appreciate having the option to switch off calorie tracking on ""Active time"" - this is not something that I personally want to see, and it does not put me in a healthy mindset. I also wish it was possible to turn off the step tracker - I just want to use the programmes and log my activities manually."
This application should have 0 stars. You cannot read your workout from the watch. Usually you can then you create a workout that refuses to synchronize. The result is the application will skip couple of days and then continue to synchronize (and you will loose those days forever!). My best advice is to buy a samsung watch to your enemies.
"I downloaded the latest update and a few hours later, my phone crashed. Took almost two hours on the phone with a tech to restore my phone. Now my phone was reset to factory setting and the app won't let me log in. It just keeps spiraling. I read in a blog this is a common problem. Solution? Blog suggests downloading the older version, but a warning pops up that says it can be harmful to my phone to download this."
This app was working great with my Galaxy 4 watch for about 3 weeks but now the calorie count stops calculating all together in the middle of workouts. The time and heart rate is going but the calorie count stops after just a few minutes. 15 minutes into a high intensity workout recorded 13 calories burned. And there does not seem to be a fix for this anywhere.
"Once I upgraded, it stopped counting my steps properly. I was doing so well too, it is only counting maybe a quarter of the steps I've been walking per day. I usually like the ""together"" portion of it, and I was doing so well, I would be way more ahead in it, if it would have counted all the walking I did this weekend. It has been a great app until this point. Very disappointing"
"Used to be a great app for steps and the Global challenge. I would be in top 10% often. Utterly useless now if you don't have a Samsung device that can sync to SHealth! Step counts from my Garmin don't sync since Samsung made changes in Sep/Oct 2020. So I have 2 choices: do Trail running with an inferior Samsung device or run with my S20 and risk it getting damaged... Real pity that the response will probably be some lame excuse about forwarding it to their support team, but nothing will change."
"Step tracking - Good. Exercise - Good (only 3 quick options, but plenty of exercises and even specific weight lifting options to choose. Syncs to other apps). Automatic exercise tracking - Sporadic, Bad (Recommend Google Fit or MapMyFitness). Sleep tracking - Ok (occasionally doesn't track at all. Have to manually check and record every day instead of automatically. This should be visible in the widget). Daily Activity - Ok leaning towards Bad (goals can't be set lower than 1000 steps, 30 min, or 100 calories. Short HIIT workouts or starting small from being sedentary won't reach goals). Water - Bad (only tracks glasses, not oz. Randomly adds water intake on its own). Food - Ok (Cronometer is the best for detailed nutrition. No syncing between other diet and fitness apps). Women's Health - Ok (Options for additional symptoms and mood. Fertile window is nice to see. Recommend Clue for more accurate predictions and much more detail)."
"I used to love this app, but steps are now only recorded if I have my phone in my pocket - it will not transfer data from another device. The second update has removed the 'trends' section in weight management which was useful and motivating. There seems to be very little point in using this app as sections keep disappearing..."
"I have always loved this app. It has everything on it, that I want and need. I severe health problems and the app keeps me aware of my heart rate, oxygen levels, sleep patterns, calories, fitness goals, so being a free app, its great, but of the past couple of weeks, the app fails to open at times. I have tried updating it. So it might be the app or my Samsung note. I'm not sure, but apart from this glitch, its been a great app for me."
"1) Inaccurate sleep monitoring and inability to edit sleep hours, and 2) does not show workout data in app even though I initiate and end workout tracking and when I attempt to manually enter the workout that isn't showing I receive a message saying that it's a duplicate entry. I can't track calorie burn, HR, distance, etc. Very frustrating."
Hate the new app. Completely different. Do not update. Trying to sell everything. Can no longer get listing of your readings. Junky looking. Pop ups. No more simple oxygen saturation. Can only be measured thru stress which takes too long. No choices on what you want to see. Took a nice simple app and ruined it. Do not update on your phone until u can see the new version on someone else's phone.
"The app is good, works smoothly, and i like keeping track of my health goals.. however the stats of the challenges each month are obviously easily cheated by other samsung users who seem to do 200,000 steps in an hour of the challenge.. so whats the point in even setting up a challenge when its not even close to being accurate."
Heart rate and stress stopped working. I reinstalled the app and now I don't even have the measurement button for those features. Update: I called Samsung. Apparently this was caused by an Android update to my S10 that came on 4/27/22. Hopefully they fix it soon. Phone is not broken and they did not intentionally remove the feature.
Keeps sleep timing record automatically as well as steps count automatically . And very helpful to make a perfect schedule and increase good habits in daily routine. The heart rate sensor stress test even records a glass of water lol nice. The events of steps are amazing it builds up competition which is good. The discovery part is fantastic various videos for releasing stress are available it's good but payment is necessary in most of them so it should change atleast for Samsung users.
"Overall I like the UI. It's a pretty easy to navigate and has some great information. I gave it a 2 though because I submit my monthly steps to my health insurance to reduce the cost, and you can only see total steps and distance for single days. Why can't I see a total for any date range?"
Recent update ruined it. Update has retrospectively changed my target for historical data; changing the current target back to what it used to be has not updated the historical stats which now only say I met target e.g. 1 day out of 31. Used to be able to view data by day/week/month in a graph which would average out active time and steps but now it's only daily. Steps are counted inconsistently now but that could be due to OS upgrade - which is why I upgraded app too but that's not resolved it.
"Generally a great app. I just wish that the sleep algorihm was both more accurate (the sleep time would be estimated based on the last time that thr phone has been used, and it'll will detect the wake time based on when the user first touched their phone - a pretty good initial indications), as well as more feature-rich - an option to add multiple sleep cycles, as lots of people over the world (including me) tend to sleep for an hour or so in the afternoon"
"I have been using this app daily since January 2019, and it kept me on track to lose 100 pounds. I was still using the app to record my calories and weight to successfully keep the weight off. Then today I open it and find out that the policies have changed and the app needs permissions to have total access to my phone. I see no need for something used to record my weight and food choices to know my contacts and access my camera. Please change the policy back so I can have access again."
"Update:. I just revised my review from 4 to 5 stars. My only complaint was not being able to edit My Foods. I found out how, that option is under the ""..."" button in the top right! Great app, has everything except. I love this app and use it everyday to track everything from food intake, workouts, BP, etc. And I've lost 32 pounds so far using it."
"This app should NOT require access to calls to functionI really like this app on a Samsung phone. However, I can't get it to work on my new Pixel phone. That stinks. When I try to log in it just spins. I read somewhere to open the app without signing in, but that is not an option. The first page says sign in and there's no other option. Update 1-27-21: I applied the posted update and now it works."
Absolute garbage. Doesn't tell you your micronutrients. Don't let the follow up by the company fool you. The app only shows % of total macros. The only way to know the total gram amount is to go into each meal and add it up and keep track of it on your own. Knowing % is absolutely worthless especially considering almost every country allows for brands to round up and down to the nearest 10 calories for every item making your calorie count wrong unless you add and multiply gram macro amounts.
Excellent all around. I love the calorie counter.
"I wish it had more in depth information and ability to break information down. Also, I wish my notifications worked. It would also be great if I could access my information on a website so I could see more than 30 days of exercise and other information laid out. I went from a fit fitbit to a galaxy watch, and I'm not sure which I miss more, the device, or the app and website integration."
"I don't like being forced to give all permissions for phone calls/history to this app for a feature I do not use... ""together"". **intent and possibility are 2 different things. Give me the option to not use Together, and I will reinstall the app. Samsung watch, phones, and headphones are not looking as good these days."
Great app but defenately needs some improvements. The app does nott always record distance while walking but it still count your steps. Somedays it will show your walking distance but my history shows a gap of no distance recordings between 1-2 days even though it count how many steps ive taken those days. It would also be great if we had the option to put in heart rate manually in the app without having to buy a smart watch...
"I used to be happy with the app as long as I was using my old phone, recently I've switched to Galaxy s9, since then, I can't set the calories intake to auto fill. there is no option for it in the weight management and target. I know how much calories I take daily and don't need to enter manually every day. Now because I don't enter my calories intake my weight management is always ""under"" which is wrong :("
I used to love the previous version of the app where data was displayed up top and a nutrient score was assigned daily. I could track the calories and how much gms of protein I consumed each day with one glance because it qas displayed underneath the %. Now I have to dig through it to get this number. It doesn't display the actual g of carbohydrates and fat consumed anymore. And it doesn't trend the amount of micronutrients I consumed over time. The new interface...ü§Æ please switch back.
"The has one issue which should probably be addressed. ""Steps"" cannot be edited and I for one find that to be necessary as most of my steps aren't really steps as I have been driving a backhoe. Being seated, driving back and forth, should be registered and it would be great to be able to make edits so users can get a more accurate count. Other than that, it's a good app"
"Ever since upgrading my phone from the galaxy s10 to the galaxy s22+, this app no longer works with any consistency. Also you can no longer measure anything unless you have a compatible watch. There is NO finger measurement on the new phones so blood pressure, stress, blood oxygen levels, etc can not be measured using your phone. Samsung seems to have taken them away. Will be removing this app from my phone."
It doesn't always keep track of steps unless the phone feels movement. Troubleshooting suggestions says that phone needs to feel movement and it may not detect correctly in pocket. So it can be in my pocket and not record as it should. But where else can I place it? It also doesn't give you the option to start an activity or workout. Limited functions in my opinion. Not sure why it doesn't use GPS efficiently.
"This app has not let me open it for over a week now, I've checked for updates but there are none. It'll go to the start page but nothing happens, I have to close it with the close all screen. Then when I try to open it again it's just black, I have to close it the same way. I've shut down my phone and restarted it multiple times but it still won't open."
Mostly accurate for activities like running and hiking. I tried to track snowboarding and it was not even close to correct. It's unfortunate that there isn't more of a community that uses it. (all my friends use Fitbit app) Also wish that the Gear Fit watches could swap out excercises for ones that the user actually uses.
"Terrible on Galaxy Watch 4 I have all my settings cranked up my watch. Always on display as well, but it constantly drops to the point that it doesn't count for an entire quarter mile. It works great on my phone though and my original Galaxy Watch so I assume it has to do with Wear OS. Edit: I have no clue where this ""more"" option is for the pedometer. I have looked at many articles and posts and it seems like I'm not the only one."
"Amazing and simple for tracking everything from caffeine intake to sleep quality! Had to give 5 stars as I used this on holiday for tracking my hiking and swimming and it's so in depth paired with the galaxy watch. Absolutely brilliant tracking with so much information, the the sleep quality feature on the galaxy watch is fantastic. It's very fun to track things on a day to day basis and then look back at the trends over the last few months. It will tell you everything you could ask for."
"after completing a workout I got in the car and drove for a little bit, there is literally no way of deleting that section of my run and I now have awards for running like 20kph which is ridiculous. Every other app offers this feature and the Samsung support site has marked this issue as 'resolved' 12 months ago without actually resolving the issue in any way. This watch is my first Samsung product and I was hoping to switch phones soon but this, as well as the built in ads is so disappointing"
Greatish app but it made my battery die unless it was constantly on charge but then how could I update my daily steps if I did not have the phone on me. No way to update it manually either. Sorry but when it is improved a bit I may reinstall but for now I have to leave it. Also I didn't like the continuous bleeps (randomly) too much unnecessary noise. Calorie thing and food update was OK but it did not recognise a few of my foods and some were way off on the calories and nutrition info so that needs a tune up at least. Water counter and weight and sleep recording great if you remember to update them.
"There is an ambush on privacy by taking information, what is the need of so much information, there should be an option of skip, information has to be given forcefully, why so?"
Please help. I can't link Samsung health to MY AIA apps for the workout tracking. Although I have already done the setting for all permission for MY AIA apps in Samsung Health.
"Great at the start with my old Samsung Galaxy S6 but doesn't sync properly with my new Xiaomi Mi9T phone. I lost 2 days of work outs when I changed phones so I couldn't complete my monthly challenge. Also, it has a habit of pausing when I'm running. Very frustrating. Not sure if I'll continue to use the app."
"I have been using this app for several years. Within the past few months an update changed the available data which was disappointing. It still tracks most things but I liked seeing more data regarding calories. But on the bright side, the tracking of sleep is automated and very accurate. Overall great app. I would give it 5 stars if it still had the old data that was removed."
"After reading the responses to allowing access to manage phone, I think you should remove that as necessary if it isn't really something the app needs. I tried to switch it back but it doesn't recognize it. Useless, had to reinstall, but after seeing how you changed the app I un-installed it."
"Its a great app and I really like the new revamp of it. I just wish that when recording meals and snacks and such, there was an easy way. Some other apps allow you to scan the barcodes of food items and the information is automatically entered into your food log."
"Please please please bring back the weight management app. It made it so clear and easy to see if my calories where over, good, or under for any particular day. Was the best part of the watch as far as I am concerned. It helped me loose 2.5 stone, please, please bring it back. The app/watch is not the same without it ."
"Good app, it's getting better. But there is a room for improvement, I would like to have more options for running, for example to log and see heart rate zones, set and customize interval training, edit routes on map. Also possibility to use a proximity sensor for pushups, situps would be nice addition to the SHeath app."
That's true. This app is no longer available for non samsung phones. I just bought a new non samsung phone and I have active2 watch. When I'm trying to login it just spins and nothing else happens. So I can't connect my garbage watch to the new phone. Overall active watch2 is just a pedometer after these updates. Don't waste your time and money with these devices. I'm absolutely disappointed. This is my last samsung phone/device ever. My rating is below zero.
"Like others, I remember this app being very useful in the past. Re-downloaded to track a run while on vacation. Now requires access to phone contacts (not optional) and gets stuck in a 2-factor authentication loop. Plenty of other, better options. Skip this."
"I use the app daily to track my steps and my workouts. I don't use it to do their workouts, but perhaps I'll try them in the future. I was already using another app for that. I like that it's an all in one app, tracking food, sleep, workouts etc. You can challenge friends. I see where I am against everyone, against my age group, and in world wide challenges."
"Samsung Health is a great app to keep track of your daily activity from sleeping and eating, to excercise, tracking heart rates, and assisting in lowering stress levels. It is also a tool of motivation to make your next fitness achievement solo or with friends. It is fun. It's been in my pocket or in my hand while I have went from 253lbs to 209lbs currently."
"SWIMMING DISTANCE INACCURATE I have loved this App for a long time as a way of syncing with my Samsung Gear Sport and tracking my activities. It's great for Step counting and analysing runs. It has definitely helped to motivate me to do more exercise. HOWEVER, recently the distance recorded for swims is way out..often saying I have swum 2 or 3 times further than I actually have and the times per length are all over the place. The main reason I purchased my Gear Sport was for swimming. Help pls."
"Updated, and still can't edit sleeping records. Watching a movie appears as a nap, and can't delete it without doing the same to the actual sleeping time. There is 2 options, edit and delete. When choosing edit, it will show the sleeping record details, but only show one button at the end ""delete sleeping record""."
"The updated software on my Android will no longer allow me to take my pulse or my oxygen levels. Why did you fix something that wasn't broke. I tried uninstalling the app and reinstalling it, but the results were still the same I could not use any of the options like pulse or stress. How can I go back to the original app which work just fine."
I've been using this app to track my calorie intake and my active minutes. I like the fact that it automatically counts my steps when I'm simply walking somewhere without me having to turn the app on and activate it. although I do hope they add more food to their list and more exercises as well including mostly core/abs since there's a lack of them.
"The app no longer works. It starts asks me to agree to conditions and then says can't setup Samsung session expired and closes the app. No guide on what to do to fix this.... Update: reinstalled the app and had to go through a bunch of setup stuff...but now works... But poor transfer implementation, if the old app is being retired then put a notice there to say you need to reinstall the app, not just leave it for consumers to figure it out..."
"For the past month the step counting has been spotty at best. It may not count steps for half of the day and then sporadically starts counting again. I will go to bed with a count of 11,000 and then the next day see that my steps from from the previous day are rising to over 13,000...which according to physics is impossible because time travel isn't real. This app used to be accurate to 2 or 3 steps and was great. Something happened and now it's barely reliable and almost a joke."
"I use to like this app because it kept track of my sleep, food intake, and steps but now I'm thinking of removing the app. The food list is old and is never updated. I had to add so many foods and meals because what I eat is never there. I have to manually input the information on each foods while other apps can get the info of the internet. After the latest update, my steps are being counter twice because I can't select the option of just tracking my smart watch which doesn't make sense."
"Been using this app for over 2 years now and finally deciding to call it quits and delete it. The app used to be simple and worked nicely but with recent updates, it now blocks you from using it and viewing your own data unless you allow permissions like letting the app make phone calls (which I don't want to) and make a samsung account (you weren't required to make an account before). Wish it would go back to the way it was before..."
"At first, I wasn't sure what this app did besides tracking my steps, but when I got serious about tracking various health conditions, I started to explore it in depth and found it far more useful than anticipated. Activity, food intake, sleep, blood pressure, blood sugar, heart rate, water consumption, even my blood oxygen saturation level, via my new S9 phone! Since my phone travels everywhere with me, I've always have this at hand. The only improvement that I would like to see is a simple tracker for menstrual cycle, so that I could keep all of my health data in one spot."
"Since updating my mobile, the Samsung health app has stopped automatically counting my steps. It doesn't even work when you set it up to count. I walk an hour most days and most of the time its counted far less than I've done. It constantly says paused when I'm still walking! Before the update, perfect!"
"Account setup was a nightmare. Multiple loops of passwords, Google account sync, 2FA (which uses SMS!!!) and finally stalled out in 403 errors inside the app. Tried to contact Samsung but after typing up my bug report the submit button on their form was broken. After a half hour I can finally open the app, only to learn the one thing I wanted to do -- sync body composition data to Google Fit -- doesn't work."
"Been using as a standalone app for 2 years. No problems when linked with AIA Vitality Thailand to collect points. Been having problems ever since started syncing with MyFitnessPal for food intake and info and Sleep as Android for sleep and sleep satges. App does not sync at all. Time stamp stays the same, does not update at all. Logging out of Samsung account and re-downloading app does not fix problem. Syncing exercise data with MyFitnessPal makes multiple repeated entries throughout the day."
"the app itself is okay but yet another damn app that has ADHD. People don't want or need for their apps to constantly keep in contact to ""remind you to check your progress"". if i want to check my progress i will, i don't need reminding at every opportunity. unfortunately to turn off certain notifications that are useless you need to turn off the useful notifications too."
"I really love this app, it has let me become more healthy and help in weight loss. the only thing i wish that could be edited is the exercise portion. i see they have preloaded content but i would like a manual option to add other workouts that are not preloaded lets say i did a work out from YouTube or a class i want to add it in but I'm not able right now because we don't have the option for it we only have preloaded content. so it would be nice to have more control over other exercises"
"I've used this off and on for years, and I like it. I'm motivated by numbers, objectives, and benchmarks, so it's a good fit for me. BUT, I'm working on getting adequate sleep, and I really wish this would display trends based on *total* actual sleep time, not just time in bed. I slept 6 hrs 13 minutes total last night, but the highlighted number is the 8:22 I spent in bed trying to sleep - and no trend available for the right number. This app would get five stars if it fixed this issue."
"I liked the app since it keeps track of my lifestyle. But just recently, it does not track my steps anymore. It does before, until yesterday. I was with my phone the whole day, doing groceries and stuff but when I got home I saw that it tracked 0 steps. Please fix this. Also, my samsung music keeps stopping midway a song or at random times. It stops when I close the app or when I open another app. It also isn't displaying in the notification panel anymore. Thanks, Samsung"
"App does not work. After inputting credentials, it just spins. Resetting or clearing app data doesn't fix it. Very frustrated. Post response edit:. I'm sorry. I cannot spend time on the phone to fix your app. If you want to reach out via email or some other way, I'm available."
"I have only used this app, in conjunction with my Samsung Galaxy fit tracker, for about a month but it has really helped me restart my exercise program. It also provides helpful insights about what I eat, sleep-related data, and other health information. However, I really miss the Weight Management feature that was removed in the 8/5/20 update. Can that be reinstated?"
"Horrible user interface for years. No longer auto-knows when I'm jogging like it used to a couple years ago. And why does an app that counts your steps and logs your weight need to take up 500MB (half a gig) of storage space? Bloatware. I'd love to update to latest version, but apps like yours hog device storage space, making me not able to update. Planned obsolescence in full effect as each passing day Samsung and app makers strive to use up all 16GB I have available"
"This app is so frustrating. First - why the stupid scrolling ads at the top of the screen? Second - WHY the 2-step authentication of my data? Does anyone really care about how many steps I take or what my heart rate is BESIDES ME?!!!! I had to reset my password and then kept getting kicked out of the app after I set up the two-step bs. Ended up reinstalling it and restoring my data. UGH. Just a pain. Seriously, make apps that are less annoying."
"Love this app but they took away a feature I need. I get fractured sleep and on my new galaxy watch I get lots of options (oxygen saturation, ecg, etc but I can't go into each sleep record to see the individual stats. Also the sleep efficiency is gone but that's not quite as important. I would like to be able to evaluate each sleep session as I could with my all my previous Samsung watches including the gear s2 which didn't include rem. Overall I love this app."
"App won't work unless I allow permission to make and manage phone calls. Not going to happen as that's a huge overstep on their part. I'll be finding another app! To your response: If something isn't necessary for the app you shouldn't be requesting access to it. If something is required for ""optimal"" functioning then users should be able to opt out, knowing they may be giving up some features if they do. But this is not the case, users are unable to use the app without granting permission."
"I used this app (specifically the weight loss tracker) to loose 11 lbs I am extremely disappointed at the recent update that removed the most useful function. After reading tons of other reviews I know I am not alone in this feeling. Let's examine the why. Either whoever designed the update is completely oblivious or, and more likely, this is about profit. Is the master plan is to relaunch the function as an app we need to pay for? Reminder- most DID pay- for your devices. Alienation=profit loss"
"Unable to update weighr! Really Samsung? One week later, still won't synchronise! Thought you were the best!"
"1 star for the addition of the pulse oxygen measuring. Minus 4 stars for the removal of the weight management section of the app. This was an integral part of my weight loss plan, and a huge disappointment when I saw that it had been removed. Please listen to your customer base, and restore the weight management functions to the app. I also agree that with others regarding the food tracker graph needing to be returned to different colors instead of shades of green. Please fix, then 5 stars."
"This new update deleted all of my data. Edit: So I decided to uninstall to see if that fixed the problem. It did, however, I still lost six months worth of data because apparently none of my automatic backups actually worked. This is still BS and I'm going to find another app to transfer what little data wad left."
Useless. Don't bother unless you have the watch. Also need privacy invasions to even open. Sad how bad it got.
Samsung is really poor at handling data accross devices. While in sync with the gear it erases all previous achievements. Dude seriously?! all my 5 year long data have gone in an instant. Your cloud services deletes previous datas upon sync with current data rather than merging them up. The most frustrating is they don't even ask of any such kind before erasing them.
"Unfortunately, I bought the Samsung 4 watch before I realized the weight and calorie management feature was no longer available. I know I can calculate the numbers myself, but that's why I bought the Samsung watch - to work with the app and give me the info. My fault for not checking. Still, that feature helped me lose 50 pounds 2 years ago. Won't recommend Samsung app or watch anymore. Selling this watch and getting another tracker with weight and calorie management features in the app."
"Really, really pissed. 2.5 years of data lost due to trying to roll back last crappy update. Didn't realise when I deleted the app that it wouldn't keep all my historical data, as I thought it was constantly uploaded to my account. So upon reopening the app and trying to find the log in, I find instead everything is gone. I did this because it no longer allowed me to enter a new food and it's nutrition information from it's packaging. Very angry."
"Overall a good app. With the Covid-19 pandemic, it would be very helpful to have a oximeter feature. More than helpful, critical for some people isolating at home. Since it already tracks pulse in the same manner as the finger devices at my Dr's office, it can't be that hard to program a Samsung phone to do read oxygen levels as well."
"It would be useful to have a favourite option for the workouts and add more workouts and categories for the workouts to make it easier to search for something you like. I use Keep which is connected to Samsung Health and I have a Samsung FitE which is synced to the app as well, however when I do a workout on Keep, Samsung Health will pick up the workout from my watch and the Keep App so it looks like I worked out twice. Intergration with other workout apps would be great"
"Lousy responses from Samsung. Boilerplate replies to reviews criticizing the DEMAND for access to phone features. There are people WHO DO NOT WANT the ""together"" function. We don't want ""friends"" (ie, anyone on our list of contacts) contacting us through the app, or issuing challenges. Make the feature optional, not mandatory. It is not an improvement, it makes things worse."
"App is good but not great. I'd love it if it had an extended database with food from all over the world (like MyFitnessPal) so it's easier to add consumed food/drinks/snacks by just scanning the item's barcode. Aside from that , can't wait for the Galaxy Watch Active to become available so I can get one. üòè"
"Not a bad app, but has several downfalls. It really needs a web interface as it can be difficult to find and compare info esp past cycling. Would be good if supported google apps esp google pay as the Samsung ones are limited or don't exist esp ski tracking. Global challenge cheating is frustrating. Missing integration with aia vitality. I can go on..."
"Everything you could ask for in a fitness tracker. Update: Downgraded one star. Since the last big update, every day I have to change my calorie intake goal. It seems to reset to a calorie goal it determines based on my height and weight. I used Samsung Health religiously to meet my weight loss goal, and I have nothing negative to say about that. Now that I've done so, however, I know better than the app how many calories I need each day to maintain. I wish it would stop changing it every day."
"I used to think this was a 5 star app and recommended it. But since your last update, doesn't show me any more. All I had done the last 6 months are gone. That is when it loads. I will try contacting tge developers to see if they can fix it, if not then will change my rating. If they do fix it and my history is back then the 5 stars should not be a problem."
"Was an amazing app until a week ago, give or take. Possibly related to the update issued not long before that. But it crashes every time I try to open up the heartbeat details and only crashes about half the time trying to view the sleep details. That's really kind of unacceptable for a company like Samsung. That's a bug fix and please just save your time apologizing and saying to contact you back if I'm still having problems. Roll back the update if you have to but there is no reason for this"
"This app is awful. I've set it up to track my steps and it's not tracking them at all. It's not a background app so should log steps. It only works of I shake the phone in my hand. If the phone is in my pocket it just doesnt work. Update: I cleared cache, paused and restarted step count. None of which I should have had to do when using the app for the first time. It's very intermittent at counting steps, tracks about 1/3. Also phone tells me to set it to background app due to huge battery use"
"I wish my s3 frontier watch could work without an app, but I can't really change that. Either way I love that I can use this app to visually see my calories and find the calorie count of food decently quick. That's the main thing I use it for and I've lost 15 pounds with its help. Now the struggle is just not gaining it all back ‚ò∫ üòÇ"
The new Samsung Health app is terrible. It does not provide basic information the old version supplied. Something as basic as seeing my monthly averages is gone. The ability to review daily/weekly/monthly averages no longer exists. The steps and active time functions are my main use of the app. Neither provides the information needed for better performance. Please give me back the old app.
Keeps crashing and won't let me sign in all the sudden
I was having trouble syncing things to MyFitness Pal so I decided to give this a try. My only complaints would be not having the ability to add a generic workout with a specific calorie burn and not having the bar code scanning ability in my other app. Otherwise very easy to use and intuitive.
"Good but needs some updates. I'd love to be able to track my macros and adjust the recommended % to suit my lifestyle. Other than that its been great to monitor everything else, but such a pain to use another app to track food and to make sure intake and output are in the correct zones."
The step counter is great motivation 2 lochmoor because it kind of makes it like a game or a challenge you can even add friends and it will compare your stats so if you know if you're above average or below-average and there is literal competitions you can join. Same thing with adding how much food you eat. When you see it in numbers in helps with understanding your health food wise.. Shows where you're high or low and what foods will provide certain nutrients. Great for visual learners
"I loved this app, because it helped to lose 50 pounds since the last year, and I'm still on the way to a smaller body. After the recent update the weight management dissappeared and I felt lost. I cannot track my calorie intake properly. I beg you to return this feature."
overall I find the app very helpful. I'm hoping to actually start using some of the programs available. though i know it's a little outside the box for the purpose of the app it would be nice to have the option to set it to pregnancy. weight gain is necessary and i started using the food tracker because I want to make sure I'm gaining at a proper pace. it'd be preferable to not be reminded that I'm overweight üôÇ
"Edited to add (01-Dec-19): this app updated itself without my permission. I have automatic updates disabled and did not choose to update this app manually, so I'm quite unhappy that it was changed without my knowledge. Original review: The app no longer syncs with Runkeeper, which makes my Gear S3 completely worthless to me. Thanks a lot, Samsung."
"I have used this app for a few years now and this new update is awful! I can't even open it on my S8. It keeps trying to open then a box pops up telling me to close or send feedback. Well, I've sent feedback several times, since the new update, so I'm sure something will change. Unfortunately, for now, I have to uninstall. Here's the update: I now have a Samsung Galaxy A6+, great phone, and my app is working super fine as of today (01/31/2019) thank you Samsung for doing your part. You Rock!"
"I cannot Log into this app anymore. It asks me to enable 2 factor authentication. When I try to do that, the ""Verify"" button is not clickable. Half the times, I don't recieve the OTP. I don't want to enable two factor authentication. Just let me use the goddamn app And now my account has been temporarily blocked because of too many verification attempts. Stop frustrating your users unnecessarily. There are so many other issues. The sync b/w this and my Galaxy Watch 3 sucks"
"I will never understand how developers think it is a good idea to remove functionality. In this case, looking at historical data and averaging that data. I have worked in software for 23 years. One major thing all my customers expect is YOU DON'T REMOVE FUNCTIONALITY. 10/18/2021 - What happened to the option to display continuous heart rate data? Looks like more functionality was removed."
"Doesn't even update my latest blood pressure readings, useless graph, you have to go to Samsung health monitor to check that. Also it basically forces you to install Health Platform which from what I've seen (or haven't) does absolutely nothing and even hinders performance for some people. And the pop up to install Samsung health doesn't go away after you install it. Pretty useless phone app."
Annoying interface. When looking at daily breakdown of sleep/exercise etc you can't flick between days without having to scroll back to the top of screen and tap another date. Should be improved so you can swipe between days. Sleep pie chart should also show different colours for levels of sleep. Interface is generally clunky.
"I want to give it 5 stars but having to re-poll my steps to pick up additional watch data and some foods do not include calcium etc so certain daily stats are incorrect. sometimes opening is very slow too(I have my pedometer display widget set to open health when I click it) , especially if having to wait to then click the back button to get to the main health screen."
"New update took away the option for 6 seperate meals and only left you with three. I eat six meals per day. Not 3. Now I have to put three meals all mixed up together under snacks. This together with the new UI thats just way worse than the old one is very annoying. Also, my auto updates are off. But Samsung forced this update on us. Come on Samsung...!!!"
"Health functions work properly most of the time, but Samsung has no limits when it comes to forcing ads even though we've already paid for their product. Got the app to connect my Galaxy Watch to my Note 8 and the app has ads that can't be hidden and ad push notifications. Frankly, this is unacceptable and although I think Samsung makes superior hardware, it might be time to switch to Apple if they can't keep their greed in check."
"It's fine but the challenges could be more imaginative. The same monthly challenge gets boring and from what I can see, the only bit that changes is the name and color. Weekly walking, cycling and running challenges that can be tracked would be more engaging for the end user"
"Flaky app. Every update brings some new problem. The most frequent is the inability to edit sleep cycles as imported from the watch, as of October/2022. The edit function is still present, but it won't accept any edits in bedtime or wake time. You can DO the edit, but not save it. You need to edit to account for time spent reading before sleep, etc. The app counts it as sleep. I've already cleared cache and rebooted. Didn't help. No longer very useful."
"I enjoy using the app, however I have been using it for about 3 years now and it would be nice to see more variety in the challenges as the same ones get repeated each year. Also I would like to see more animation as u make progress through the challenge map."
"This POS drains the battery constantly, have tried to disable the automatic workouts to no avail, even when disabled and I pick my phone up it just automatically starts speaking workout resumed, no way to disable the voice when you reach the end of your workout all I want to hear is work out complete, don't want to hear all the stats because I'm still walking to my house and I want to hear the rest of the song that I'm listening to, so I Uninstall after each use."
"App simply doesn't work! The app doesn't allow me to get passed the sign in screen. Having looked up the issue online, it would appear that this has been an ongoing problem for many that Samsung has neglected to solve. Also, clearing the cache isn't a solution to the problem for myself. I've reinstalled, rebooted, and tried everything recommended on the Samsung forums. The fact that this app doesn't work means that my expensive galaxy wearable is useless."
"A great app. . Not necessarily the most accurate. It's easy to cheat with just arm or hand movements if using a portable device. Otherwise it's very instrumental in tracking your progress and good for motivating you when you are short of your programmed goals! Finally, I greatly appreciate the health articles and tips too! Since my last post, this app has improved dramatically! The sleep and heart health features are A1 and very helpful!"
"I Like the app a lot but it would be great if it were compatible with CGM apps in some way like for the Freestyle and Dexcom. Also I think some Of the ""verbiage"" needs to change. I am a big girl and it is not necessary to put words like obese underneath the weight when I enter it into the app. If I am feeling good about reaching my weekly goals and enter the change into the app, it is annoying to see the word obese. It is a derogatory and discouraging term. I DONT APPRECIATE IT."
"Having used this app now daily for the last month and a half, I feel it deserves more than the quick few word review I gave it before. Since using all of the resources available in the app I have managed to lose 25 lbs and continue to do so. This app is convenient for you to track your exercise and calories all in one place. I certainly believe in it now! The only suggestion I would make would be to add a scanner to add food items into the calorie tracker portion of the app! Great app!"
"I've been using this app for over a year. It's been great! However, I just did an update yesterday and now I can't get past the ""agree to our privacy policy"" part. First, it kept saying ""an error occurred"" and would shut down the app. I uninstalled it and reinstalled it, and now when I click on ""accept"" for the privacy policy, a little circle just spins and spins. This is really upsetting! I need my app back! Help!"
"Samsung has systematically removed features from the app such as heart rate line graph and comparative weight graph. Recently, the app has also failed to add steps taken whilst I am tracking an activity such as a run. I'll finish a 5k+ run, to have none of those steps added to my daily total. Contacting support has been met with superficial and banal corporate responses that have resolved nothing. This is app is disappointing, and Samsung's really nice watches are let down by it!"
"Hei, my app was working fine but from the last 6 months it is not detecting my steps automatically. I recently updated it as well, with no impact on the issue. Kindly help me resolve it. I did what you asked me to but the app does not detect workouts or steps automatically anymore. I have to open it for it to record my steps and it stops recording as soon as my screen goes off."
The fact Samsung continues allowing people to cheat during the monthly challenge is ridiculous.
"Update a few months ago removed the ability to view weekly and monthly trends (averages on chart) for many measurements, such as weight, blood pressure and blood oxygen. Only daily trend is available for these measurements. I expected this to be mistake from Samsung Health developers and fix to come soon. However, many months have now passed and they still haven't fixed it. Why would you remove such an essential feature? If someone is trying to lose weight, being able to see the trend only several days back is useless. Trend over longer period (weeks, months) is what matters."
I love the app. It's been a tremendous help in changing my lifestyle and becoming healthy after my diabetes diagnosis. The only thing I wish they would upgrade is the food log. You really need to be able to scan barcodes to add food. 5 Stars if they added that feature. Works flawlessly with my new Samsung smart watch. Love it.
"I bought a galaxy active 2 to track my swimming. As far as I can tell it's only compatible with this app. This app doesn't even open and I can't sign in. I've searched numerous discussion boards and every solution doesn't work. So basically, the watch is rendered useless because the app can't even open. Thanks for nothing. I'll probably get an automated response that says I should call samsung. I don't have the time for this. Very frustrating."
"Update 4/28/2022, when my Samsung Gear Fit2 Pro runs out of battery during a workout, that workout does not sync to my app, can that be fixed? UPDATE: When the next update came out, the app began to function. Still getting the feel of the app and it's usefulness, but I am enjoying it and did not want to leave a poor rating up. Prior rating: I can't really rate this app because it will not open on my Pixel 3. It just spins. I also cannot access the data from a web browser? VERY DISAPPOINTED."
"Gave it 3 stars so I could tell the developers that I do not like the new format of the Home page, with today's update. There is less info viewable at once. The previous (grid) layout was much more useful than the new stacked layout. Plus the tiles could be arranged by the user to meet their needs. Please go back, or give option to select the customizable grid layout."
The app worked great on my S9+ until a software update in the summer. Now it won't maintain communication with my Accu-Chek Guide glucometer. They are paired but data just won't receive to this app. It will work for a few hours after unpairing and repairing then it's back to failing. Emails to support have gone unanswered for months.
no longer syncs with other health apps. used to record all activity and data would sync with strava and and my fitness. this is no longer the case which makes both the app and galaxy watch now of no use to me as a fitness tracker and have had to go back to the old but reliable Garmin and Garmin connect app. seems the recent update to Samsung health has resulted in it no longer sharing data with other apps. what have you done? it needs sorting.
This WAS a great app until this upgrade. Key uses were Hiking and Walking. Hiking no longer records steps. Walking is too sensitive to movement and constantly pauses and FAILS to restart automatically. Step count does NOT update in real time even at very moderate pace - steps get added in large blocks. This app was as accurate as a Garmin in the hills - it is now virually USELESS.
Since the update all workouts gone for the last 3 years. Also shity new layout. How can one monitor the annual progress? Where can i see the monthly steps? Where are all the stress and heart records? change it back or at least allow users to roll back! It is now actually pointless to have the app or for that matter Samsung at all. Over improvement destroys. Obviously most people hate your September 2018 update.
"Very good, with a couple issues - notably, the ""food tracker"" part of the app. I like the metrics (vitamins, fiber, protein, etc), BUT, they aren't accurate. For example, if you eat a ton of carrots, the Vitamin A bar doesn't really register anything. It tells you to eat certain foods to increase intake, but then when you eat those recommended foods, it doesn't accurately reflect in the app."
"Just deleted this ap after years of use. They took a thoughtful ap with useful features and and turned it into a shell of it's former self in January. I stayed hoping they would listen to people and reintegrate the useful features the ap had before January. I would have paid for that version. I installed the most recent update and it would not give access to my data unless I gave them permission to access phone calls . I am not okay with that. I accepted, downloaded my info and deleted the app."
"App is great. Love being able to track my food, exercises, and steps. A few changes/additions would be great though. Like being able to scan the barcode of food items, adding a recipe without having to use another app to figure it all out, and maybe changing the water to single ounces instead of using 8.4 at a time."
"This app gets updated regularly, but not all updates are an improvement. The latest update to the steps widget shows a green progress bar until you reach your goal. In the new version this has been made thinner, why? And worst of all, it disappears when you've achieved your step goal. Why? Why take away the sense of achievement?"
"On my old galaxy s8 the health app measured blood oxygen/stress levels and other results ,I miss this with my new flipz4 phone . Why was it not included with flipz4."
"I've moved over to this after swapping to a Galaxy Active watch. My old tracker was a Fitbit and their App is just better! Their badge idea engages you to try and walk as much as possible (I so wanted to try for the 100,000 in a day) and the layout for going through past days steps and heartrate data is far more user friendly. In an ideal world I'd have this tracker and their App... unfortunately I'm stuck with this disappointing junk üòï"
"Announcements at mile mark stopped the time announcement, then quit entirely. I updated the app and it didn't help."
"WHAT Happened to UX !?! A 5 star activity app just went to 2 star ... This app was one of the main reasons I've stuck with Samsung S2, S3, S5, S7 and now S9 ... Latest version completely destroys the easy view of past activity and steps that I use on a daily basis to track my progress ... Used to be so easy to view and switch between daily, weekly and monthly activity or step history with averages. A single bar for each day/week/month period, meant you could see multiple days/weeks/months at a time and easily scroll through the history ... simple, clear, easy to track and controls within easy reach of your thumb .... New view is a complete mess ... 7 day/31 day/12 month views are so confusing ... accessing them via the tiny icon right at the top of the screen is super awkward ruling out single handed operation ... and then it just shows masses of daily lines on the screen ... and you can only see a single time period at once ... ??? ... I appreciate the comment I received from Samsung ... I hope they can restore at the original far more motivating graphs and functionality before the time comes for my next phone ... I was trying to keep all weekly and monthly activity averages green ... now I can't even see those ... another thing missing from the new version is the breakdown of daily/weekly/monthly activity ... it used to show averages for each activity in the selected period ... now it just shows total daily activity"
"With a recent update, they took away the weight management widget. This now forces me to manually calculate if I am over or under my calorie goals for the day. It was my favorite aspect of the app. I could at a glance know how many calories I needed to burn or could eat. It helped me be consistent with my weight lose goals and drop 15 pounds. I am now looking for another app to use that makes it just as easy as this app use to be."
"Steps tally never comes near to recent workouts, I don't care my phone with me all around home so the results should be close when I go for a walk. Some exercise workouts fail to be recorded. If I make a mistake recording sleep, it thinks I'm trying to cheat and won't allow changes. Length of stride doesn't seem to matter. Some of the messages are patronising and age / weight don't seem to be taken into account."
"I love the app, it encourages me to do more steps and drink more water. But since the last update I'm pretty disappointed with the step counting function. It doesn't seem to record accurately and keeps stopping all the time so you miss heaps of steps. Makes me want to give up on the monthly challenges."
Still i am fasing same problem it's almost 15 days i can't open and how to share screenshot i try but I can't
"I love the app normally, but since it updated I cannot connect it to a few different apps. When I go to add the permissions it blocks it or says all permissions instead of specific ones like step count, so I cannot connect it to withings or achievement. Is there a fix to this? If there is fix, I will up my rating for sure!"
"I have had the application for over three years. The performance lately is terrible. Currently it no longer tracks steps at all. I don't know what to say, other than I am terribly disappointed with what I thought was a great application. Yesterday it showed about 2800 steps and it just stopped counting altogether."
Was very happy with this app used almost everyday. And then all of a sudden the map showing my walking path disappeared. Ive spent hours trying to figure out a solution and can not find one. I will be switching to a different app that tracks the path you walk/run/etc.
"App not working, not sure why can't access anything. Keeps prompting to agree and change settings then diverts to nowhere and nothing changes. Used to rely on this to keep track of health and steps, now redundant. Update: Tried to call the number in the response and its disconnected. Tried to send email through support and it keeps saying MY email address is incorrect. No joy. Will delete this app now. Supposed to be a health app not a health hindrance."
"A rather unfriendly app & ecosystem when you start digging into features. Does not sync freely with many health apps. Does not have helpful guide on using external HR tracker effectively. Does not have many workout themes (HIIT, Indoor options). Unfriendly Summary reports. Ref polar, fit for ideas??. By itself this app may not have earned 1 star. But having invested in the smart watch and phone and to be struggling, calls for a disappointing review."
An app that serves the purpose... It has amazing features but the reason i have given it foyr stars as it has problems syncing with other apps (eg. Speedo on) and in case you have a gear (like me) it tracks data from your phone as well as the gear which results in incorrect readings.
Beware of updates. Been using the app since nearly 3 years. I find that every single update has reduced the functionality and added more social connect options. Have stopped updating the app since a few months. Love the way it is for me as of now. The tracking and measuring is pretty accurate and ui is smooth. Just hope that future updates are to add functionality and not to remove existing ones.
"I like this app a lot, but I've removed 1 Star because with a recent update, there's now a non-removable advert for Glow Premium Menstrual Tracker on the top of my home screen. I have my personal details logged in the app correctly, so this ad is not relevant to me as a bio male. I wish that I could either have the option to remove/change it manually or, failing that, see a suggested ad for something that is targeted to me specifically based on my personal info that I have entered in the app."
"I have a Galaxy A70 and I have updated the phone software cleared the cache and data as well as uninstalled the app with restarting the phone between steps and reinstalled I can't get this app to work ever since I got the phone a few months ago. I still get ""Can't set up the app"" ""This service is temporarily unavailable."" ""Try again later. (0X700010). I have used this app for all my past Galaxy phones so I am quite familiar and by no means new to it. Any help would be welcome. Thank you."
"Walking records well. But cycling doesnt work, it maps out your route, but not accurately as it just joined the dots where we stopped for a drink/waited to cross a road, it inaccurately records the amount of miles/km, calories burnt and average speed. I've looked up ways to rectify this and all it says is to ensure location is on, which it is, disappointing. I am in the UK so contact details for the UK would be appreciated, thanks"
"First, I used Samsung devices almost exclusively since they were first brought on the market, but ended up divorcing their phones from roughly Galaxy S7 and on due to the unBELIEVABLE amount of bloatware they pre-installed on their phones... but, I continued to use S Health and their watches as I really liked how those performed. The most recent update though, where they have removed my MOST USED FEATURE from S Health - the ability to manage calories for weight management has been permanently removed and is no longer available since version 6.11. I think it might be time to look elsewhere for my next smartwatch and app. Someone is making TERRIBLE decisions in Samsung Land!"
"Failed to send me code verification via text messages, it's a constant failure that I am sure which the problem was. My phone number is active"
"Ever since the last system update I have veen expieriancing issues with the app. First my Gear would not sinc. Then my Discovery health data could not be uploaded frm SH. And now, it requests a password before I can go in to the app. It had to reset and erase all my data and now I had to uninstall en reinstall and I am still unable to use the app as it will not allow me to set up the app. Really frustrating."
This app worked great up until mid August where it stopped syncing with my achievements app. Now this app is worthless that's all I used it for. Don't tell me to email for help you won't fix it that way. Just fix the problem rather than making it look like you are helping when you really are not. I see everyone is having this problem just fix it
"Watch version of app doesn't track aerobics or Zumba. Purchased the watch to replace the Fitbit Blaze, which doesn't have built-in GPS, and for it's smartwatch features. Very disappointing that I can't use it to track Zumba. The phone version of the app does have an aerobics function but without a connection to the watch I can't monitor my heart rate and the calories burned are an estimate. Will need to continue to use the Blaze until Samsung updates the health app for the watch."
"Could be so much better... I gave up my Apple Watch when I switched to a Samsung phone so I'm using this app with my Galaxy watch. I miss the fact that Apple Health synced with the apps I use like WW. Being a cancer patient, it also synced with all my health records which was super convenient! This app doesn't pair up with ANYTHING. Now I'm almost wishing I'd downgraded to a fitbit instead."
Used with my galaxy smartwatch mainly for sleep and exercise tracking with lots of good features - however the latest update seems to have taken away the option to edit the sleep data recieved from the smartwatch!? This was necessary to make the sleep tracking useful/accurate - e.g. In bed reading at 9pm but not asleep until 10pm (& the watch mistakenly thinks I'm asleep at 9pm) I used to be able to adjust the record afterwards.. Now rated 3 stars because I can't correct regular tracking errors.
The last updates removed the option to see the weight per month and the graph. It was really helpful to have an overview over my weight without stressing in every day and still have a goal. Please bring this option back. I don't understand why have if for sleep and not for weight... .
This app pisses me off. I don't walk around with my phone in my hand all day. So it tells me I haven't done any exercise. I don't have a Galaxy watch to send the information.
"This app hardly even recognizes body motion or step counts after their last update. Anyone else is facing this issue? There is drastic decline of step count even after walking for the same amount of time and at average pace. Not sure whats happening. Also, their new update doesn't have weight management, why? This is such a great app and I am not aware why they removed it."
Now forcing phone permission??? There is zero need for this. Also forcing contacts access just to see the monthly challenge. Who is in charge of this app?? You are slowly driving me away from any future Samsung products... I really wish they hadn't removed the weight management feature. I enjoyed this part of the app (even if I didn't use it as consistently as I would have liked). This is a nice app but why remove functional components without having a replacement?
"Loved the functionality of the app and having everything in one spot on my old S5Neo- but since upgrading to an S8 I haven't been able to use the sensor to measure heart rate- I keep getting ""this phone doesn't support that feature"" type errors. Bologna! How on earth is a newer model phone not support something that ran fine on an older model. Frustrated"
"I am very disappointed that the weight management option has been removed. It was the reason I used the app. Update: This app gets worse with every update. Considering I gave my fitbit away and bought a much more expensive Samsung watch just so my steps would sync properly with this app, I feel like I was sold a bait and switch. Combine this with my disappointment in another Samsung product that was a lemon, I have lost all faith in this company."
"I've used this app for at least 4 years and last week's update kicked me out and now has an error warning telling me my phone is rooted while it's not and won't allow me to use the app at all. It is also constantly interfering with my use of other apps by sending me the same warning, without my interaction at all. I've cleared the cache and uninstalled/reinstalled, forced stop, everything and nothing has worked other than completely removing the app. So bye bye Samsung Health. It's been good."
"Feedback: alphabetical sorting for ""favorite"" foods is case-sensitive. This is incorrect behavior. Please make sorting items case-agnostic."
"Changed the features. Used to give estimated calorie difference between consumption and expenditure. Also used to be able to customize your goals.... really makes me think about another type of fitness tracker and app. The standard response to call the number SUCKS!! No one there to answer the question. No way to communicate regarding issues. Agree below, the O2 sat function not recording - and yes, I have a Galaxy watch. The stress function also seems to have been disabled. What the hell is going on?"
"Samsung Health missing permissionsSamsung withdrew accidentally all permissions for Health Sync on August 30, 2019. We are in contact with Samsung to fix this. Temporarily you can use the special developers mode in Samsung Health as workaround. This doesn't do any harm. Open Samsung Health, go to the Settings menu, choose 'About Samsung Health' and tap the version number ten times in a row.' I tried this and I can sync now. Either they fixed the issue or the developers mode worked."
"From tracking your steps, to your heart rate, or competing against friends, this app has it all. It is really great to have such a motivational app, and it even syncs to the fitness watches to help keep track of everything and motivate you. Highly recommend!"
"How to potentially lose a loyal customer base?! I have owned a Samsung phone for over 10 years. I also have a significant lung issue, and Samsung had the ONLY phone sensor based blood oxygen tracker. My three respirologists and many others were amazed. Pre 6.5 update helped get me home from hospital early today. Updated app, now can't find option anywhere. Maybe stress tracking feature not available in Canada? Haven't been able to solve with available online resources yet. Really disappointed!"
"Have been using this app for at least 4 years every day. Do not understand why it needs to manage my phone calls. I think I will find a new tracking app. You have no need to manage my calls. I think you may have finished this app with the latest update Already found a replacement app. Its a shame but you asked for too much to count my steps. After seeing the lack of proper response from Samsung, this will be my last Samsung device. I think they have poorly judged this one. Untrustworthy"
"Really good for tracking exercise and workouts as it has quite a few options for sports and activities. However, it is missing some such as parkour and other less popular sports, though I doubt they'll add them. But if they did it would be great. Step challenges are a really good idea"
I used to love using this app. I used to love Samsung. Until now. I have not opted in to any ad customization services and I don't have anything like that enabled on my phone. However when I open Samsung health I am greeted with a massive banner ad at the top of my page with 11 different ad cards in it. It is redoculous. I paid $1300 for a new phone and the stock apps that come pre installed have egregious ads in them? This is unacceptable Samsung. I feel cheated. I will consider switching.
It seems it is not possible to manually upload a workout to Strava. Would be really handy.
Samsung Health and the Wearables they have do not give valuable feedback. I want to track something more meaningful than my steps. Total active time or calories burned during movement. Steps are not counted well with the watch and if I do not carry my phone around with me then the step count is bad!!! They are very inferior to other products on the market.
"Great app! Love the food & weight managment tools. I would change only 1 or 2 things. PLEASE consider them with your next update. You can't reset the daily steps tab. If you want to reset daily steps, you have to clear the data in the app settings, it clears ALL your data in the app. Please concider adding the ability to reset daily steps at any time and save that particular day or session. Also add number of steps to the Excercise tab for the walking & hiking type workouts. That would be great!"
App works well for most things. However for awhile now app does not track walking or running. Only way to make it work is to keep app active on screen. Even phone screen saver stops it from tracking. It used to track accurately as long as app was open on device. Now pretty much worthless to track a walking or running workout. Step count still works fine.
"It's OK but Very disappointed in the food bank. A lot of the foods I have tried to find are not there, and to add to the frustration, you cannot scan food bar codes to keep accurate track like you can in My Fitness Pal. If Samsung cannot do this please allow connections to apps that will be beneficial to me!"
"Latest update has made this app useless. When I open, it shows signin button. Nothing happens when it is clicked. It is stuck on first page. Before update it was working perfectly fine and did not need sign in. There is no option to create account also. Update: Customer support suggested to clear cache, run device maint and restart. App still stuck on same screen. Debugged myself and found that it requires contact permission. I don't want to share as I don't workout with group."
"I agree with a lot of the other reviews, there is a lot of wasted space in the new layout. I have also found that data from 3rd party apps like Sleep as Android & MyFitnessPal are no longer syncing even though the permissions are set & I have not changed them from when the data was syncing previously."
best workout app I've used. since downloading to my LG G6 I've noticed my phone performance has slowed down. my phone lags alot and text tones even are distorted. My friend have a iPhone and its doing the same to his phone. it would have been 5 stars but until thats fixed all you going to get is 3 stars üôÑ please fix this issue of slowing down phone performance.
Unable to login after updating to current version. What's the point of putting your email address when it's a 'no reply' address? Your reply was quick but do tell me where your location is and your office hours. I called only to find out that it's closed. Otherwise provide an update patch that works. Shouldn't have updated in the first place. Regret.
"It's ok. Hate the way, at times, it just stops counting steps. Takes awhile for it to start again and doesn't count the steps done while stopped counting. It may be when you stop moving for a few seconds or a minute. Very irritating. Fix that and probably be ok."
"I used to love this app, because it provided a O2 senser option. I used it for many reasons checking my grandparents and fathers oxygen levels because they suffer from lung and heart problems. I also used it for myself, and others varies time. I understand that you can still detect it under stress, but it's very inconvenient. Is this because I have an older phone? Samsung please don't be like iPhone and update my phone to stop working like they did. I cannot support a company who does that."
"This used to work well. Now for the past month or so the app is no longer counting my steps accurately. I've been up and around since 7 am and my counter is stuck on 15 steps. I haven't met my daily step goal in over a month because something changed within the app. Yesterday I was stuck on 2583 steps for most of the day and didn't realize the app had stopped counting sometime in the early afternoon. What happened, Samsung??"
"Use it every day. i use it in conjunction with a Samsung smartwatch to track steps, heart rate, sleep daily and reasonably often to do programmes. These are varied and aimed at all levels. Also handy is auto tracking of cycling. The are a great selection of pre loaded activities to launch and track. Best if all it's free!"
"The app lately hasn't been showing up and not even working at all sometimes.I've literally had this app for over 8 years and maybe last year was the best it's ever been now it seems to be going down hill unfortunately . please fix! UPDATE also stress and heart rate isn't working correctly, or working period. That used to work flawlessly. What's the problem? Can't be me or my phone because lots of other ratings and comments are similar"
"Keeps losing track of my Galaxy Active 2. Even though bluetooth shows it connected, the app says it can't find the watch. I have to turn off BT, then turn it back on, then open Galaxy Wear, try to connect it, then Open Health and hope it recognizes it. Very frustrating when I am trying to sync."
"Awesome App! You can track basically anything health related in this one app which I have not found in any other tracking app previously. It has access to multiple types of workout programs, monthly challenges and Google Play music so you can play that while you plug into a workout. Love it! Highly recommend."
"its useful, but it doesnt record the numbers I input for calories correctly from my galaxy watch. it removes input I do via the watch and adds calories every day that I use it. sometimes it even moves yesterday's meals to the next day. this is very irritating. I though I could use the app alone to keep all of this up but it's not reliable at all. this is especially sad for me since I wanted to check the statistics for my caloric intake too"
Your last update took away a feature that I used all the time. I tracked my steps against a monthly average. so it set a goal at the beginning of month to make sure that I tried to hit that goal on an average for the month. Seems that feature is gone. Very disappointing
"The previous version of this app was perfect, I'm not liking this new update. Stats were much easier to look at when tracking food and calories. Also meals were spaced out better throughout the day....... Now instead of seeing the food consumed in grams at a glance, now it's in percentage."
The app was brilliant. The sleep record was great with detail. But now if I want to see something I have to hold my finger etc where as before it was all on one screen.... Samsung was considered to have the best health app and now I'm really not impressed with the update. If it wasn't broken why try to fix it???
Does not save my ECG anymore. Some excersises should be based on sets and repetition instead they are all based on time.
"5/9/22 This app has worked great for the past several years. Since the latest update the SpO2/HeartRate/Stress sensing tracker is nonfunctional. 6/10/22 It's been since Easter and this is still non functional. It seems like this is a cash grab for people to buy their watches to continue to use this feature. Boo, tomatoes, tomatoes, tomatoes. 7/16/22 They fixed the issue and the app so far seems fully functional. Thanks!"
"January 2021: the latest update has apparently removed the ability to see trends in weekly average weight. Without that, this app is much less useful. Daily weight fluctuates too much to be useful. Please add back that feature. For now, I will be leaving the app. Used to be good but it keeps getting worse. üòï"
"Update should improve things, you have removed features. The best part of last version was the blood oxygen level tracking and monitor especially with the current pandemic. It was a lifesaver for me when I was sick with covid. Bring back the previous features."
"Terrible update. Soo much wasted space. Old version I could see everything at a glance on one page and it was tidy. The update is a mess with too much scrolling to find anything! Edit: just noticed the update seems to have broken all the connected apps, and nothing updates to Samsung Health anymore. Defeats the point of having this as a central app pulling everything together! Uninstalled! :("
This app was pre downloaded on my phone and I didn't realise I had it until a year in. I've never been much fussed by exercise or eating particularly 'healthy'. I always just believed to eat balanced and do what you can. However when I found this app it inspired me to make an effort. I was pretty static before I used this app where as now I like to actively work out and track my progress. I think it's a great app for those of us who are just trying to maintain a healthy decent lifestyle.
"When selecting ""walk"" from the exercise list, this app says a 25 minute, 1.5 mile walk burns 1300+ calories. This is absolutely incorrect. But, when the walk is auto detected, it says 100-150 calories burned. This is accurate. No support from Samsung to fix this error. My Apple watch does not have this error. This is happening on gear s 3, galaxy watch, and the phone app. Yet SAMSUNG does not help."
"I'm enjoying these work outs but problem is, once finished you go back to check to make sure it's been ticked but said's you haven't completed it, (when I know I've done it from beginning to the end.) finding that a bit frustrating. It's also been glitching a lot more."
The new update has ruined the graphs for the weight. One of the pleasures of this app was seeing my journey in weight loss over the past few months. It was honestly the only reason I still used this over other apps. Now it only shows the graph over the past 7 days.
"The app is HUGE & requires many other apps, more storage & permissioms I am not comfortable with. There is NO history!!! that makes it impossible to compare data & if I don't catch it before midnight, I don't even know what my final numbers were. A BIG problem for us 3rd shifters. Anyone know of a better app? I love the band, but the limitations of the app will make it impossible to keep."
"They removed the floor counter widget on the watch. It still counts your floors and you can find that under steps, real small. In addition, in the phone app there isn't a chart for the week/month/year data displaying just the floors. It was a good watch but at some point started dropping useful features."
"Used to have good options for trends in reporting and the ability to get to your data quick, now thats all gone to make it ""sinple"" but its clunky and doesnt give me the useful information. Will be looking for a way to replace this app. Please bring back trending on all graphs, please bring back the full weight management features. Edit: Ok ita not an ad just a big banner for your announcements and samsung advertisements. I dont want a new phone, I want to track and trend my fitness..."
"My app now shows MPH, but not on the Workout Lock Display/Screen after you start your exercise. I look at the stat widgets while cycling and the lock display CONSERVED BATTERY. Samsung has removed the ability to rearrange what is in view on the lock display but also the ability to change what you see. WHY? I have to change back to my old exercise app. Hey Samsung, I called the number but it's the same response, this wonderful feature has been removed. The developer contact email is bogus?"
"This app is very helpful. But, I'm giving this one star rate because of the horrible customer service. I've been contacting them for more than a year to solve an issue I'm having eith the app, they never cared to respond. There's also an option in the app which allows you to send a request to the app developers asking them to add missing food or meals, I have made so many requests, and again, they bever cared to respond. This is a show of disrespect, which is an important fact for me."
This app isn't showing the Blood Pressure tile on my new galaxy watch 5 pro. How do I get it to present as an available tile?
"The daily calorie target changes constantly from what I've set it to, so I keep having to go back and change it again. Also I have to add a lot of food manually, especially vegan foods. Generally not a bad app but there are improvements that could be made."
"The mandatory permission required for the app to make phone calls and such that came with the last update is really creepy. I don't find the 'for a better experience' explanation to be a valid one. I already downloaded another step tracker. The Samsung experience is getting worse every day. My next device won't be a Samsung, for sure."
"Have loved this app but lately the voice guidance is off. At point 5 miles it says 0 miles, at 1.5 miles it says one mile,etc. please fix"
"I love being able to use my Samsung fit bit. I'm able to enter my food, caffeine, & water. It is very motivating to watch how much water you drink, so you drink more water. Also the food you enter has everything, all restaurants if you eat out, if you drink diet, you can literally record everything. so you watch how you progress. It keeps me on my toes as I slowly change my eating habits as well as it counts my steps, when I exercise, I input if its dance, walking, running, etc. love it!"
"App won't open without permissions to access my call history and to make calls, this app should not require access to that information and therefore is a data security concern. Just more samsung spyware Edit re response: even if what you say is true, it's an invasive change for a feature I don't want, it's enforced. The privacy policy says ""check if your connected to Samsung connect""? I don't want you to check this. I've spent 1500 pounds on samsung to track my health and now they're useless."
Completely worthless after the privacy update. It forces you to enable two factor which is fine as a concept but then it won't accept the verification code. No matter what I do the verify code button is grayed out and cannot be selected. I have already contacted customer service they are completely useless all they tell me to do is enable all permissions and clear the cache and then restart my phone none of which works. Really glad i got this watch for free because its useless as are the apps
"This app would be great if it can add the following: 1) Add trend line graph instead of the current bar graph that you have to scroll back to see. Having 1 chart with different length options would give a better big picture. This is the main disadvantage in my opinion 2) Allow sharing or exporting the raw data for trends 3) Add bar code scanner for inputting food 4) Integrate with Alexa for voice commands to add food, drink, weight, etc (same as my fitness pal)"
"As a health tracker Samsung Health has improved this year. I bought the active watch to help me control my weight and the Daily Activty tracker is a step in the right direction. Sadly last year the very best feature was removed which was a comparison of expended vs consumed calories. When will they learn, people don't use the sleep tracker as we charge our devices rather than use them at night, nor water tracker however being able to monitor calorie intake is genuinely very useful bring it back!"
"Very good app, i really love the new interface"
"This was a great app until this recent update. I used it quite a bit whenever I needed to lose weight/get in shape and it helped me stay on target. Now it requires you to have an account to utilize the app which is rediculous. The last thing I need is another password to memorize. I just want to select an app and use it, not jump through hoops. You can keep this app Samsung, I'll manage my weight on my own. Also, keep your cut & paste response because I'm not reading it."
"The app was working fine until the 2 step verification process came in. Now everytime I try to access my app I get a message ""can't set up app. Samsung account session expired"". Email address is given as no reply. How can I report it if I can't send email? I've had same log in credentials since I registered. I'm losing out on active days with our rewards program as I can't sync the data. Nothing updated since 7 May. Assistance please."
Its a great app. I appreciate it that I can still use its basic functions after the OS minimum requirements has been increased. It has come to be very useful during the pandemic. 6 stars. But I agree with Katelyn M on the Hardware requirements to use a watch. My Longterm healthcare provider doesn't want me to use a watch.
"I used to love this app, but now it's pretty garbage. Samsung removed the weight management tool. Yes it will still track your steps and you can set targets for weight loss, but what is the point of setting a target if the app isn't going to help you track it? They didn't even add anything useful in the recent update, they just made it worse. I'm off to find a better app."
"The loss of the ""weight management"" function is blow to the app overall. I've stuck w/Samsung phones & smartwatches in conjunction w/the S. Health app due to that feature & without it, the app loses appeal & function for me. My next watch & phone purchases I'll be looking for systems that have that, as that's a critical selling point for me as a customer. Samsung Health should 100% bring it back."
"Awful update that removed trend monitoring features and is counterintuitive. When your target is to lose weight, the text is green when your weight goes up and red when it goes down which is really weird. The loss of ability to track monthly and weekly trends is so baffling, why remove the most useful part of the app? Can I rollback the update? This is incredibly disappointing"
"using Samsung health helps me hold myself accountable. it's fun and user friendly. I love that it tracks my steps and does monthly goals for step count. it's a great way to stay fit and have fun. it's also a great way to finally see how many steps I've been logging at work, I also love that you can individually challenge friends, great feature."
"Finally got access to app again somehow. Issue before: said was using rooted phone so was unable to access and gave up. Issues now: does not sync data with samsung gear s3, does not record data when trying to manually input, stays stuck on loading whenever trying to do anything. Very disappointed with how the app is now, used to use it daily but now it's useless."
"It's a nice app. You get many options. Few things can be improved like default food info, everyday adding is little tiring. Takes time, instead if it keeps adding default options mentioned, and we can modify if required. Similar with water info. I'm using galaxy fit2, I'm still not sure why there would be always some extra steps calculated on my phone on walking session. Fit2 itself is pretty accurate. Other options like fitness are pretty good. But less motivating to open and play something."
"Great app overall. But can I suggest that in the food logging section, to add a tab where I can scan the food product's bar code because so many times I couldn't find what I was looking for. Also, can you add a vegetarian or vegan challenge? For example, when tracking food, start a ""how long you haven't eaten meat"" calendar."
"Not allowed to measure. Prior there was an option to measure stress level pulse ox , pulse all kinds of things there was a measure button next to each option where you could add data this is no longer the case it looks like it's trying to sync to an accessory but I do not have any wearable accessories other than my earbuds I tried uninstalling the app reinstalling the app erasing my personal data and trying over but they never show up"
"Not worth it. There's no barcode scanner for food; half the food you manually search has inaccurate nutrition; adding food is harder than nearly every other app out there. The water is set to 8.4 oz per cup and I can't just add an ounce amount manually, like 40 oz every time I finish a hydroflask. I'm waiting for my samsung watch to come in to see how the app works with it."
"Hi Team, A great app, but note that if I undertake cycling and pause it and thereafter exercise by way of walking , the app fails to recognize the walking efforts until I click on finish cycling. I sometimes undertake cycling in two spells which may be Morning and evening. Also during two spells of cycling at different points of time the calorie meter continues to move as if I am still cycling. It would be good If this issue can be resolved."
Holy this app has gone down into the gutter in the last year. Ever since they removed weight management last summer this app became worthless and made me completely regret buying an active 2 smart watch that I'm replacing with a none sumsung version at this point. They also removed graphs for tracking heart rate and sleep and weight. This really isn't an app anymore it was great a year ago but now I'm looking towards fitbit or manually installing an old version of this app so it works.
"Got a samsung fit, excited to pair with my Samsung A70, however it seems there's an issue with this app not being able to work in this combo due to a recent update. Unable to set up the app, making my fit pretty much a glorified watch. Very disappointing. This needs to be fixed asap Samsung - if your own devices and apps can work together, I'll be taking my business elsewhere"
Since the latest update the ECG app on my Galaxy 4 watch is no longer functioning. There is no update to be found. My device is up to date on Android version. Also the Body Mass feature does not measure past 66% progress before saying the watch needs to be on properly. I tried it on other people as well to no avail. The stretch feature occasionally freezes. I reached out to Samsung and got no solution for the issues and no email from support returned despite promised a reply within 48 hrs.
"Like for general tracking of health, diet and exercise info. Just wish it had more options for tracking for breastfeeding moms. There are certain foods that aren't listed that are breastfeeding related, plus it doesn't take into account calories burned from breastfeeding. It'd be really great to include those features. Plus it'd be really awesome to have post-partum workouts for things like diastasis recti that many post-partum moms have to deal with as we shouldn't be doing normal crunches while we're healing. But that's just my two cents and things I'd like to see in the future."
"Can we please fix the login for this app? I was getting used to it and starting to like it (despite the inability to sync with other services). I reset my phone and now I can't log in. My Wear app connects ok, but not this one. üôÑ I'm not wasting my time sitting on hold to hear some kid tell me they don't have any idea. I've spent money and expect a certain level of experience. Big fail Samsung. It's one reason I don't use your phones anymore. Read the other reviews. This isn't isolated."
"THANK YOU for finally sorting out the lag/delay issue. Good servers = good application out-put! Great app again, includes everything you need. Best used with the Samsung watch. It would be great if you could bring back the Weight Management feature and the Coffee in-put feature. I just purchased a Nespresso and I need help - the coffee is just too good."
Seems like the battery drain issues are now mostly fixed. The app is pretty nice for tracking your health data.
"phone had to be resetted back to factory setting. when loading back the app no longer worked. contact Samsung numerous times and they did not help at all, but gave me the same response each time when I told them exactly in detail what the problem was and what I had done to try and fix the problem. Problem is that they don't listen properly. Samsung also has no toll free number for assistance."
"After an update I can no longer use the app. The app won't run now without setting up a two-step verification (which you can not opt out of) that is stuck in a loop of sending me a text code that when I verify sends me back to the beginning of the process. The suggestion to contact support isn't viable since I can not launch the health app to access the settings > contact support, due to the 2FA loop. Nor am I in the US. Sad face.."
The recent update must have fixed the problem where the Sleep Score/Stages are now back to showing the graph when pulling the data from a Samsung Watch. THANK YOU FOR FIXING THIS! I have been trying to map my sleep cycles. Now if you can include syncing data from a Philips Respironics CPAP machine this would be the PERFECT app!
"Pretty OK, but with the latest updates there are big issues with food traking. The search doesn't work properly, I need to exit and go back in and eventually I manage to find what I am looking for. I sometimes get Skip option although I selected one or more foods. Also can you please add the option to alphabetically sort the custom foods or meals. Or a search function. Right now if I want to change a custom food I need to search the whole unsorted list."
No longer works without Samsung account even if you have no interest in uploading data. Unacceptable. I read Samsung's reply and it is apparent they do not understand my issue. I don't care to share or back up my exercise info at Samsung. What is the advantage to me in having an account and storing my data there? I see it as just one more opportunity for my personal data to be exposed in one more data breach. The apps have been uninstalled. I purchased the watch specifically for standalone use.
"What happened? It used to work great.. every update, it gets worse and worse. The manual treadmill input is counter intuitive. Every exercise has 11 seconds at the end, when seconds aren't even an allowed input. Just revert the app to a few versions ago and STOP MESSING WITH IT. It's like the devs are just giving themselves problems so they can justify their employment. Update: developer just sent auto response telling me to KEEP updating when that is the source of the confusion. What a joke."
"The designer of the new version needs to be fired, this doesn't perform basic functions, e.g.: can't set pause speed threshhold so if you bike slowly up a steep incline the tracking will autopause; the app falsely logs thousands of steps during a cycling run (it knows I'm cycling, why doesn't it autopause step counting?); the app only shows amalgamated exercises from last 30 days, unable to see e.g. the cycling logs alone. This app is a frustrating troll."
Works well with Samsung Galaxy S22 plus. How do you enter height/weight/step length which was available before updates??
"As a Huawei user with a galaxy watch, I can't even give a real rating because the app simply won't start. I have tried reinstalling, restarting, but nothing. Every time I enter the login details, I'm greeted with a loading screen and nothing else. I understand that cross compatibility is never 100%, but opening the app should be an issue. I'm considering returning the watch because I can't use half of what it can do."
This app has been fairly reliable and has been quite helpful tracking a variety of things. An annoyance is when it decides that I'm doing an activity I'm not. Like when I'm walking with my walker and it thinks that I'm cycling. Just let us edit the activity type afterwards. Sometimes it thinks I'm sleeping when I'm not and this program won't let you edit the hours. You would need to delete the entire sleep log. I like to have the data it keeps on sleep but I have to track my actual sleep amount
It was amazing till it stopped working. Wont even let me open it it just has a error. Tried uninstall and didn't work
Keeps me informed of almost every thing I do to get help from the app to live a healthy lifestyle and has so many features that you can use for this reason.
"Hi Samsung, can you guys add the feature that tells you how many calories under or over you are back in? It seems to have vanished with the most recent update, and I find that feature very useful. Otherwise, it's a good allround health tracker, with a good amount of free mindfulness sessions and invigorating monthly step challenges."
I had this app download on my Samsung phone maybe 5 years ago and it was integral to my weight loss journey. It was called Samsung Health My fitness pal. I downloaded it today and found that the app is not easy to navigate for finding something as simple as recording my weight and goals. Also it‚Äôs not compatible with my other apps so I could not transfer my information. Still love this app but needs a little bit of work since it‚Äôs been changed.
"Does anyone else have a problem with their vertical ellipses missing on the exercise block? Mines not there and it's making it difficult to add workouts that I've already completed if my watch is too low on battery or is dead. Other than that, the app is very handy and the watch works like a charm."
Samsung fit is good but killing it's self by choosing only specific device heartbreaking ü§í even though my device is supporting my friend device doesn't (my friend uses Samsung device)
"Great app. Works well but as of recently it hasn't been syncing properly with my watch. Things such as the sleep data wouldn't sync and would say syncing with galaxy fit but not have any results. Other than that this app has been really helpful in keeping track with data for steps,exercise etc."
"Update: after struggling once again with amazing Samsung support I switched to MyFitnessPal. GJ, Samsung, you're getting better each day. --- Seems like the application database of products is selected automatically based on the user's locale. It would be good to have it configurable. For instance, I use English as the general language of my S10. However I cannot find then products available in Polish stores, the ones I previously saw and know are actually on the list. Would you please fix this?"
"After the initial setup (that includes sharing a ton of private data) the app refuses to open ‚Äì gets stuck in the forever loading screen. Opens neither through the app icon or quick links under it, nor through the 'Show on phone' feature on my Galaxy Watch4. The watch itself is a great device, but the functionality is very limited without a phone app. So sad. I guess I'll have to switch to Pixel Watch when it is released..."
"Been using SH for a good few years without issues, but over the past few months it's becoming less accurate and freezing, for example I walk my dog the exact same route every morning and adds up to 7500 steps and a great start to my day ahead ..recently tho my step counts are less than 5000 .. my location is excellent, but as it's a free app I'm not surprised its getting faulty so I purchased a fit bit and the difference between it and Samsung is usually 800 steps per outing ..2 stars or 1"
DOES NOT HAVE WEIGHT MANAGEMENT!!! People buy trackers like these and pay a premium for weight management not because they are fascinated by how far they walk in a day it's not like our phones can't do all the other redundant fluff thats on the tracker/ watch. You should be able to change from lbs to g with ease and if you accidentally record food under the wrong date you should be able to edit that easily. Downgraded my score because of the lack weight management.
"It's a really good app and covers basically everything I need for my health. The only reason I give 4 our 5 stars is because there is no way to scan food items into the tracker. Almost all food tracker apps have this ability, and it is quite annoying to have to manually search for each item."
"For the last 2 months, the app no longer tracks my sleep schedule. I used to get a reminder every morning to rate my sleep. I don't get that anymore. The footsteps are are also not being recorded on certain days. Basically the app has become rather unreliable in terms of monitoring activities"
"The pedometer on the challenges only was stuck for days. I refreshed the page multiple times and the challenge page and the map were stuck on two completely different numbers for six days( 40,000 + steps difference) after uninstalling the app twice i finally gave me the higher number but never gave me credit for the other six days that I accumulated and was never counted. What's the point if you can't even monitor your progress?"
this app is great. i love how it pairs with my new watch. one of the things I still can't figure out is why we can't challenge multiple people in the same challenge. seems like that would be a standard feature for friends to compete together. maybe they will do an update to add it in.
"I've tried logging in and out multiple time. I have even uninstalled the app. The verification work does not want to work. Verification codes have been sent and when i try to log into the app, it says that too many verifications code have been used!!!!Please fix the issue. Also isn't there another options, like logging via emailüòæ"
"Great app and always improving. Logging food, work out log, GPS maps of your run, achievements and trophies for personal records, and more. Challenges are lacking, but I'm sure that will eventually be implemented. I love the 5k and 10k program that sets you up with a training schedule designed to help you meet your goal each week. Keep up the great work!"
"I bought galaxy classic watch and I connected the watch with this App.But unfortunately, I am not able to use the BP and ECG Tool in the watch since it says it is not available in the App in India. Please help.Thank you"
"Love this app! The voice coach that talks while you're working out is my favorite part of the app. The first time I used the app it said ""look at you getting fit"" and ""smile."" I like that when you've almost reached your target out gives you extra motivation and says ""You're almost there. You can do it."""
"I was loving this app until today. I went to walk and when I tried to open the app it said the Privacy Notice has been updated and to read and accept. I read the policy, clicked on Accept and I get a message Unknown Error has occurred (0x0B). I then powered off my phone, thinking that would help, but still get the error. It still counts my steps, but I like the feature of setting a goal and also recording my meals. How can I get it to work again?"
Have been enjoying the app using it with my Samsung gear watch to track everything. up until yesterday when it decided to track both my watch & phone combined so now my steps and activity are hugely inaccurate! As there is no option to turn off steps recorded by my phone I have no choice but to look to use a different app that will track my daily steps and activity accurately!!
"PLEASE add the feature for weights back! I like to look at my weights from the past by pressing the selections ""month, weeks or days"". And now there's only 1 options. Which are days. So I have to drag the stupid scale all the way to the year I want to see my weight. This is so stupid. Not functional at all!"
"My husband and I have this app on our Samsung phones. With the old version and the current version, when we walk together, our step count and therefore stimated distance traveled varies by as much as 3000 steps which translates to 2 miles!! We met another couple on the trail last week with the same issue. I think your algorithm is off. There seems to be a built in bias towards men taking longer strides. My neighbor tells me I should get an Apple watch."
"This literally used to be the best app. But since weight, calorie and caffeine tracking has been removed, it's utterly useless. Whoever set this command in motion for the new version clearly has zero insight into what it means hold down a workout / diet plan, nor do they understand the importance of daily monitoring. The key to any sort of fitness success is religious observation, and as someone who uses these three removed options daily, the app is now deemed null and void of anything beneficial to reaching a personal goal. Perhaps if you asked advice from actual athletes before making changes, stats regarding the dip in consumer loyalty would not have transpired."
"Step count used to show on lock screen on my Samsung galaxy A72. But it just doesn't show anymore. Notification settings are on. Please help Update: okay I manged to sort this out. I turned on the ""show as pop up"" option. It's shows on my lock screen now. Thank you. Great app and very handy üëç Can you advise how to get my steps to reflect a real time count?"
"UPDATE: Called the number and was told I'd receive an email to reset disable 2 factor authentication but even after 3 days, no call or email. Now I can't connect my watch/buds. So much hassle! ORIGINAL REVIEW: As much as I love the app, I'm unable to login because it asks me for a verification code thats being sent to an old number. Worse, there's no alternative way to verify or even change the incorrect phone number on record. I can't even contact support unless I'm logged in. Bad programming."
"I've used this app for years and enjoyed it, until the update where it needs to access basically everything on my phone. I've read the auto replies and it never explains why it needs all the access. It worked great for years without them. But I have found that UA has a good step counting app. I recommend everyone check it out. Samsung Health is now trash."
The new update sucks. The old ui function was perfect. Its over simplified now. Bring back the old layout for steps and food calculations. Its now confusing to use. I wish they would have added the function where you can use your finger print to measure your blood pressure. I wish you could scan your food on the food intake portion.
My steps are not synchronizing on Samsung Galaxy watch active with this app. Bothersome as I lose my step count. If you do not manually synchronise your step data before midnight all that data is lost. I am so far behind on my step count because of this. I have the galaxy watch active. Such a waste. Instead of storing music please push an update where step data is stored in a buffer and when the watch connect to phone again that data is not lost. Very disappointed.
"What happened to the Food??? I don't care about the %. I care about the total grams a day for each macronutrient. The previous version was perfect! Please bring it back!!! ""If it's not broken, don't fix it"" please! Spend your time, energy, and money for better things to do like updating the food nutritions database or providing a way for the users to scan the barcode on their food container so they don't have to manually enter the information."
"bad experience with running app. First it missed half my run because it treated the first part as a warm up and there is no button to skip this. Second it was very depressingly telling me to slow down all the time, and no way to set a target pace during the run. uninstalling and going back to a clock"
Doesn't track steps correctly on Xiaomi phone.
"The sleep monitor is TERRIBLE. Just because I don't constantly move around every 2 minutes doesn't mean I'm asleep. This thing thinks I sleep 22 hours a day or more. We need a toggle of sorts to let it know we're going to bed, or we just got up, so it doesn't monitor all day. Fitbit manages to make it work, I don't understand why Samsung can't figure it out. We should also be able to edit the recorded sleep record times in case it does get it wrong."
"Fab easy to use, accurate and compatible with my watch. Means I can log steps without my phone in my pocket, the step count and data transfer is instant and never fails. The challenges are a great way of competing with others without having to communicate directly with thousands. Great for me as I have social anxiety and avoid interactions with people, this allows me to participate in the world without anyone knowing."
Found a glitch please fix. I like to keep the Bluetooth off on my phone to conserve battery at times and If you dont connect you galaxy fit watch to the app when you wake (or after midnight when it resets) the app will not recognise the step cound on the band before it is synced later in the day. Meaning my app in the evening says I've done 1100 steps while the watch is at 12000 and the distance does match too. But the app is showing over 100 min activity.
Yet again the update has made the app worse. Now it won't reconnect to the watch automatically any more after they are seperated. Every time it disconnects I have to re-pair it. Help center says reset/reboot. It also no longer stays connected if you have to turn your location off. I wonder if this is deliberate so you buy the latest watch they'll say it works with that.... for now! I bet they respond to this with contact the help center even though I've clearly stated I already have.üôÑ
"I love this app; it had been working fine with my Samsung Galaxy Watch3 until the latest update. Now, there is an issue with the syncronisation. It says it synced, but the information doesn't come across as it previously did to the app. E.g. previously, my watch told me how many hours I had slept, and I used to go to this app for a more breakdown of the REM cycle. Now, my watch still tells me the hours, but there is nothing on the app after syncing, only record. Can you please fix this issue?l"
"why was spo2 removed? That feature was crucial in a decision I had to make. Plus it was great to keep tabs on overall health. PLEASE bring it back!!!!! update - Clearly users of this app are continuing to voice their disappointment with Samsung removing the SPO2 function. Every response tells users they can see it under the Stress feature. No one wants to jump through hoops and its not available to everyone anyways!! Surprisingly its not available in Canada, what gives?? BRING IT BACK"
I have a Samsung watch that I just got. The steps do not sync at ALL. I have changed the settings for the phone and watch to sync but no matter which it's on it still only shows for the app which essentially makes this app useless. I also emailed my issue and of course it says it's not set to receive messages.
"Do not like the update at all. Apart from having to now sign in every time I open it,and cannot go any further unless I supply my ph number,( not necessary for a health management app).I have supplied my number to apps before and then get bombarded with annoying calls from marketers. I loved how easy and straight forward the old version was...easy to use. The problem with alot of updated versions is that it is assumed we like more complicated apps! I won't be using this app anymore"
"Definitely downvoted since my phone's latest software update. I had app synched with my Galaxy Watch and was able to see how many accumulative steps I'd done which matched on both the app and my watch. Now, my watch is showing accurate step counts of 10,000+ while the app is only showing 100 - 200. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app, rebooting my watch and unpairing and pairing again (pairing took forever), but nothing made any difference. Time to get rid of the app I think"
"Can this app get any worse for activity tracking? Samsung shows it can! App announces 1k complete at just over 0.5k. At 5k, the app is at 7.5k. All pace, distance and the GPS map are completely wrong. GPS map has a jagged line between the start pint and the end point and not on the route taken. Additionally, Samsung has removed all possibilities of reporting any problems or bugs with the app from the app and redirect everything a forum that always returns an error. This app is useless now."
Great app although the September 22nd update breaks the Sync between Samsung Health and MyFitnessPal. Spoke to support and said nothing to do with them. Steps and exercise no longer syncing. I have downgraded the app and it works on the previous release so can only be the update. Now useless to me. EDIT: No way to respond to developer... I spent an hour or so talking to Samsung who failed to see the issue and told me they couldn't help. Not doiing it again as spent hours looking at this and sent all sorts of logs and information.
"Would love to use the app, but I continually get an error stating that it won't open for security reasons because my device is rooted, which it is not. Knox is still valid. It used to open and then have the error, now it just has an error at launch. I'm tired of trying to fix it, and I'm not factory resetting the phone just for the same thing to happen. I only have limited functionality on my watch. Fix your app, please."
Find this app very easy to use and Challenge my friends on the monthly challenge. Only problem is that the monthly Challenge doesn't update regularly. Sometimes it doesn't update some of my friends steps for 4 or 5 days which is annoying as we can't see who is winning. This needs fixing ASAP.
"For Samsung: how could I possibly contact you from within the app if it doesn't even start because of this?!? It stopped working after updating it 02.06. All permissions are allowed but it cannot get past the ""two-step verification"": I request a code, the app auto fills the code from the received SMS, but when I click to verify the code it just goes back to the start. After a few such failures it called me (voice) instead of SMS but it failed exactly the same without validating the code."
"Started a program, missed a few workouts. Tried to do makeup workouts on rest days but was unable to access the program from my Samsung watch so I had to carry my phone with me. Tried disconnecting and reconnecting but it seems I can only access the program on my watch on the scheduled workout day. Please fix. Additionally, it would be very helpful to add a barcode feature to input meals, where users can scan the barcode of a snack/meal. Not all foods are available when it's being typed in."
Great app for those who want to track everything in one place. It would be better if there were options to have yard work or gardening and house cleaning as exercise options. Many other tracking apps have that and with the spring coming many people will be cleaning their houses and their yards.
"Won't sync with other apps. Will not be buying another Samsung watch when replacing and considering a different brand phone as Samsung does not play nicely with other apps and brands that offer different functionality/perform better and simply want to sync steps, bpm and sleep. Especially after the recent update this is even more important."
It used to be my go to app. Now since it wants to do the two step verification i can no longer access my account. It just keeps circling around. The app opens then immediately closes. And now all of my history has been deleted. I am beyond disappointed. I have been trying to do that process for two days. I like the 2step verification idea. It just wont let me proceed just keeps making me start over :(
"Wonderful!! Has helped.a great deal to have a walking plan that can be evaluated. I'm enjoying it ......... August 1, 2020. Day1 of the ""Green Tea August"" challenge, the app captured only 5.1km of my over 2hrs walk of not less than 10km. This is totally unacceptable as it has set me back. I put my phone on max power saving after 5km with a setting that permits the App to auto update, but to my surprise it got the time right but the distance totally wrong."
The app used to have a feature where you can scan the food packaging an log the item now you have to search and search i never find the product because you have to go thru 200000 possibilities. Where's the logic in that if its fitness app it shouldn't be harder rhen running a mile uphill...I would higher but in good conscious i can't...help people be healthy should be the goal.
"10/26/21: I previously complained about reduced functionality. Not the app store running every 30 second. Tried clearing cache and data, force stopping, rebooting, etc. Nothing works, just a steady steam of app closing notices. So the app is just useless and makes my watch less useful. Wish we could give zero stars. Prior review: I don't understand why the calories consumed v. burned feature was removed. Very disappointing, seems like this app gets worse over time instead of better."
"If you want to assure ""copy paste"" that none of the permissions are for blah blah blah, then you guys should change the description of the permission to grant. Because you're not going to make phone calls from our phones neither manage our phone calls or contacts. Make it sound less frightening. Definitely everyone wants to use the application. Thanks"
"This app was very useful, user friendly and overall nice to use before the most recent update. All of my data and history from the past year have been erased and you can no longer access the app without giving personal info and allowing the app permissions to you phone. Really terrible update and allowing the app access to my phone and contacts in no way makes for a better user experience. Due to the update I can unfortunately no longer use the app. Will look for new health app options."
"has many bugs, note taking has very limited characters, also the menu isn't accurate, you should add a standard diabetic menu! (fasting, 2 hr after breakfast, before lunch, after lunch...), the translation of this menu in Persian is awful! needs to support connecting to Google Fit & store unlimited data. accessing previously stored data is hard & the app lacks a good history of overall data. some health data is available only for 1 month, making the storing data in the app useles"
This app seems to exhibit new issues on every update resolving some and adding more. The constant bugs make it nearly useless as a consistent tracking tool. I do the same activity every day (an intense bushwalk up 450m to a ridge) the app records wildly different distances altitudes and floors. Now this latest update is consuming over 50% of my gear frontier battery even without tracking any activity making the watch last only 5 or 6 hours from full charge.
"Tried this again since dumping it and all other Samsung products,in 2018 because is was junk. True to form Samsung still total junk. Can't even login. It needs 2 step verification. Why?? It demands a mobile number. THAT'S WHY. Silly me. I'm classing this as a data mining app. Uninstalled straight away. Will continue to avoid."
"Ok, after several attempts to sign in to my account, this p.o.s. wants me to set up 2 step verification, and doesn't send me a code for that. If I chose skip this, it dies with an error and starts over. Dear samsung, please, make hardware and don't make software. This is why people choose apple, because they make easy to use software, which runs great on their own products. BUT there is one great software from Samsung: DEX! I love it!"
"I just got the note 9 which came with this app. it is encouraged me to lose weight. just one month I have lost 8 pounds. the activity monitor and calorie counter seems to be right on track. the weight loss the app says I should lose based on calories consumed and calories burned has been right on target! thanks Samsung for including this with my new phone! I usually hate bloatware, but this is awesome!"
"It was great until the update asking for so much access. You don't need my contacts for me to use the together app, I can add friends myself. I gave in and gave permission and guess what, you auto added friends in my contact list without asking. Plus you took away the option to remove friends so now I can only block people. Very disappointed in Samsung."
"Lovely fitness app, it's flawless on a Samsung mobile, but not on other phones.. , sign-in takes a few attempts until done (the verification SMS is received randomly after a few attempts), definitely drains the battery , cannot remove steps count from the notification panel .. did not notice this problems on my previous Samsung phone, such a pity , really liked this app."
"Steps are no longer being tracked properly between the watch and the phone. I have tried deleting the app installing turning off the watch during it back on turning off the phone, turning it back on, but my steps are still not updating to the app and I'm going to step challenge right now so that's making things very difficult"
"I've passively used this app for years, but I just began actively using it two weeks ago. It was working fantastic, and I was truly starting to enjoy my fitness journey. Then I wake up this morning, and the weight management feature is gone. I go online, and I read that soon calorie tracking will be as well. I've been a loyal Samsung customer for years - I've always bought Galaxy phones since the S3, I've got the Gear S3, and I've consistently advocated for Samsung. No more. Goodbye Samsung"
"A good app, but activity tracking is limited to sports activities and doesn't cover active work like gardening, cleaning or DIY /building work. Also it would be nice to be able to edit the steps section as my fitness tracker often shows many more steps than the app as it's not always convenient to carry my phone in a pocket so it misses my activities.."
"Really nice app to keep track of steps and sleep hours automatically! Don't really have any accessories that allow me to keep track of more but it automatically saves a running/intense walking workout so that's nice. Only 4 stars because some days it won't detect sleeping hrs. Could be because I don't remember using my phone during the night or somthing else of course, or just a bug."
"The application is losing functionality and no longer supports multiple things in the app. Oxygen and Pulse are gone. Weight statistic for the under/over calorie marker is gone. This is losing stuff. Either put all your functionalities back or we as users will Uninstall and Ignore you. The idea of ""updating"" an application is to ***not remove features***"
"You broke the app with 2 Factor Authentication. It's an endless loop. Edit: after uninstalling then reinstalling 3 times, then disabling it in the app, it finally worked. Edit: Tried to install again on my phone, get a browser not supported message. The sign in link goes to edge or chrome.. Your app doesn't support edge or chrome!? I'm sorry but I'm not installing Samsung internet just to get the SIGN IN to work. Would give zero stars if possible."
"Good in samsung phones but deliberately garbage on other android phones. This app keeps notifying me that account session is expired log back in when i tab on that, It never goto screen where i put my credentials, something comes up on the screen and kee spinning. It just add extra notification every day 24/7. Im sure samsung knows about this issue but they pleadge to never fix it. Bravo samsung for providing broken apps for non samsung devices"
Sucks now. Used to be able to add steps manually and choose what kind of workout. Now its gone. Also Samsung Sucks in general. Im sick of the poor phones as well as the poor non step count accuracy and removal of features. How are things MORE frustrating with the passage of time? Shouldn't ai make life LESS frustrating??? Done with Samsung in general. Also adding food is beyond cumbersome. This app is really bad.
"This app is excellent, but with the recent update, I have noticed that when I try to share a workout , and in the options to choose from gallery, I am able to select the image , but the selected image is never getting updated as the background image, I tried resetting the cache and even restarting the phone still the issue persists , Kindly look into this bug or let me know the resolution, I will update my review based on that."
What a frustrating and limiting tool. Samsung wants you to use your Samsung smart watch but doesnt let you easily and quickly export workout data to programs like Training Peaks. I will be looking at Garmin for a smartwatch and HR monitoring watch which is accepted across many platforms and easier to export workout data. Users should be able to quickly download individual workouts in .csv or .gpx or .tcx formats to at least allow manual upload of workouts
UPDATE: Greatly improved app! Needs to be just a little more accurate. Fiber is NOT calculated from all entries.! Makes it extremely difficult to calculate NET carbs. Old: (12 Apr 2021) WasWas a good and useful app. Now it's worthless. There's ABSOLUTELY NO REASON Samsung Health needs to manage my phone calls.
"After the new update i can no longer amend my sleep time. Also a suggestion, it would be great to be able to add custom workouts so it more accurately tracks my progress. For example, those who do split resistance training like leg day, chest day etc, have a leg workout that includes all the exercises i would do that session, instead of manually starting and stopping each exercise."
"Why does this app use so much battery? It usually has the first or second most battery usage on my phone. I just checked and it's used 9% of my battery and has the most CPU time of any app on my phone. I've even tried to get the OS to restrict its usage, but it still seems to be misbehaving. It also never runs in the background. Its battery usage is always higher than apps I'm in all day long like messages and camera, for instance. Fix your app!"
"Once again, new version Fall 2022, wasn't tested. Have it set to notify each half mile. First half mile she says 0 miles completed and most future intervals are random miles too. Got so frustrated every update, finally went back to an old version before all of the inconsistencies began. Uninstalled, re installed, no help."
"Suddenly I got logged out of my account and i can no longer get to my data or track anything. It tells me login but then takes me to a page saying it won't load and that certain browsers are required, including chrome, which I'm using. It suggests to download the Samsung browser just to login. I will not be doing that and I'm moving to the Google pixel watch."
I am using Galaxy watch active 2 from June 2021 and my health data to Samsung account is not synced since 22 September 2021 from my Mi redmi note 7 pro. I tried many times to sync it. But it didn't work. I was planning to uninstall and reinstall app once but I will loose 1year of health data which I don't want to do. Please fix this sync related issue.
Updated: issue addressed by Samsung. Sleep hours were strangely logged an hour earlier! (or in GMT). After feedback from Samsung I have cleared the app cache and did phone restart. Same problem with -1h recording of times. Sadly is not possible to find how to contact the developer since the email provided here (Google Play) is dummy (no-reply) and the one within the app (settings/help/contact us) opens a blank page.
"Got rid of it. It was fine before, now they require accessing your contact and must allow them ability to make calls using your contacts. Plus creating an account, giving more and more private information. Totally unnecessary. I got another pedometer app, no ads, simple to use. I don't need my Samsung to try and be an invasive apple product or fitbit."
"Inadequate Support for Lbs. - the graphs for body weight, skeletal muscle make the Y axis so large as to invalidate the graph. I wrote to Samsung. The response from their BIA Support team was that I should use kilograms instead of US standard pounds for relevant graphs! I guess they have chosen. They do not care about US customers! UPDDATE: Removing health targets allows the graph to work correctly; however, as a programmer, I can say, this is really poor coding!"
"Hi Samsung, still love your app, please can you let us know if any of the much missed features are coming back? E.g calories in/out budget, floors reached. Also as another user said a trim feature for workout would be brilliant too. Not upgraded to the latest release yet due to the not logging weight issue people are reporting... has this one now been fixed? Thanks for your work on the app :-)"
"Great: (edit): today after an upgrade, Samsung requires me to d/load & install & make default, their own browser app, just to login. It will not allow me to login on any other browser. So, I did, & it's still not working. Frustrated, I've uninstalled the Samsung internet browser, deleted all my personal data, ( oddly, I could delete all personal data without actually being logged in, funny that?). Anyway, I no longer can support with my personal loyalty, the continued use of their health app."
"There is a limited number of accessories which could connect to samsung health app. Most of those are not available in my region. Xiaomi scale is available for pairing, though not the scale which has body composition, only the bluetooth weighing scale of Xiaomi. I hope they could integrate more smart scales in the Samsung Health app. I hope you could update the app with that addition."
"Does not sync to my watch. Tried many times to uninstall, unpair, reset etc but the app does not sync to my watch. My watch shows 10k steps, the app shows nothing. It's pointless. Lost a lot of data despite ""back up"" while trying to fix this."
"ECG disappeared with last update. What happened to the ECG on the phone app? I tried removing and reinstalling. It is gone. My watch and the app are connected and I have resynced many times. EDIT: I was asked to clear my cache. I did. I now have to use a separate app for ECG, unlike it used to be, but it works. The time is off as the app shows it 8 hours ahead, ever since the most recent time change."
"I use to love this app and tell all my friends about it. My favorite part was getting my blood oxygen and heart rate and with the new updates you broke it. I also use it to track my my types of exercises, but the app seems to have lost this year's data. Very disappointing, I don't understand why you would take a good thing and make.it a bad thing. Signed disappointed."
This app used to great. You could track your o2 in your blood and pulse and other things right from a built in laser on your Samsung phone. With the last update they have taken away this feature which was one of the reasons I sprung for an s22 ultra. Thank you for making me waste my money on the better phone.
"Reply: Did you even read my coment? You have changed the design and I hate it. Rebooting won't make a difference geez... Just being more annoying aren't you? Old: Why ruin a perfectly good interface??? The enter sleep time was so easy one tap movement. Now I have to type, no visual clock representation. Why? Idiots. I'm moving away to a better app. What is wrong with you???"
"After upgrading to the latest version i am not able to login to the application, when i try to open the app it asks me for signin once i click on sign in it will take me to chrome and ther it reads my number automatically and i dont have an option to change it and also if i click on continue nothing happens and it returns to application signin screen again!! No progress bit irritated because of this issue"
"DO NOT UPDATE THIS APP. YOU WILL LOSE FEATURES!!! Turn Off ""Allow auto update"" in 3 dot menu. Every update takes away features. This app is markedly different than the 1/1/2020 and earlier versions because Samsung removed O2 sensing, UV rating, Weight, and more since 2020. I Uninstalled latest version and reinstalled a 2020 version to reclaim my tracking histories. . ....................... UPDATE Oct 19, Please bring back the O2 Saturation tool. This turns me off to Samsung in a big way."
"I like the sleep tracking features and breakdown of sleep levels. I also like the women's health menstruation and symptoms tracking. However, the list of symptoms is limited and doesn't apply to most of my symptoms. We should have the ability to add in our own list of symptoms, emotions, and energy levels. Symptoms such as depressed, sad, numb, emotional should be included in the list. The app would get 5 stars if you allowed this."
"Various minor factors could improve user experience. For example syncing with my watch (4G SM-R815U), the sleep analysis is inaccurate (knitting or watching TV is ""sleeping""). Exercises are listed but activities like yard work (raking) and house cleaning (vacuuming) aren't an option. Climbing stairs is inaccurate (purposeful climbing results in no counter while walking on a hill or in my flat yard counts for several floors)."
"I liked this app when I first got it to use with my Active2 watch, but the sleep app stopped showing the various sleep levels through the night and I discovered that the Help menu is useless. Very disappointed. Another year gone & my sleep level charts have once again disappeared."
"The steps are not accurate. The app does not allow you to enter stride length and the steps will not sync with MyFitnessPal. Fitbit is a much better app and had I known this, I never would have gotten the Samsung Active 4 watch. Assuming I have long legs my steps are double what the Samsung app claims I walk daily. I have short legs and therefore, 2 of my steps are equal to one normal person's step if the app goes by health charts for height. Developers, please fix these issues."
Horse riding for 52 minutes = 0.01 miles???? This happens all the time now and it doesn't track us on the map! I loved this app when it worked and have used it for years. I've cleared cache and reinstalled many times but to no avail so looking for another app that actually works!
"Jack of all trades, master of none. That idiom will tell you all there's to it of this application. It has a bunch of features, complimented with beautiful graphics. That being said, anything is hardly praise worthy on its own. For example, the software measures the workout calorie burn based on your BMR as opposed to heart rate. This means your intensity does not matter at all as the calorie burned will always show exactly the same given a period of time."
"Great app. Perfect for galaxy watches (as it is made for them), and amazing at keeping track of your daily activities. Only thing that could be added is maybe a way to detect calorie intake by weight changes or energy changes."
"Previous versions had a method to measure one's pulse without an accessory -- not so any more. I appreciate that this is free software, but it seems to be 'slimming down' on a regular basis."
"It's good for tracking steps. But in the last month. The sleep track is not working. When I try to input my sleep time manually, it will revert to the suggested sleep time or be an hour off fall asleep and wake up time."
SINCE THE LAST UPDATE Everytime the walking app is used these same 2 prompts appear: 1 Allow Samsung health access to location x or check 2 Share location to show workout route agree disagree THIS NEVER OCCURRED PRIOR TO LAST UPDATE So everytime I go for a walk and want to use the Walk app I must answer these 2 questions. Every time. Please restore the apps ability to remember the location settings so these prompts stop appearing. Thank you
Everytime you update the app it removes features can no longer share the map of my runs no longer get continuous heart rate and can't even login now keeps trying to sign in with Google account but never get the email to set up verification ( how can I contact you through the app when I can't login customer support is in any help either a waste of time)
"Silly exercise app. Sleep incorrectly calculated. Edit sleep changes the time. Inconsistent exercise motion identification. Is it the watch sensor? How can it record the up and down of a curl and lunge, but fail squats? Can't configure routine, rest, reps and sets. wasted effort writing code for little quality."
"The app is really good and informative. Motivates you to go beyond your laziness to complete challenges. I gave one star less due to a bug in Health Connect. Regarding which I have sent an email to the dev team. Rest of it is just fine, will update the stars once the issue is fixed."
"0ctober Update: 622.5 is stable and has not crashed on my phone yet. --- 6.22.2 keeps crashing, can not use the after upgrading to Android 13. Update: Even reinstalling, and factory resetting my galaxy watch 4, the application crashes continuous after a number of seconds being open."
"I only use this app for the sleep tracking fxn and for the past few days/week, I have been entering sleep and wake times and the app has just recorded random times. Since the app also doesn't let you edit once you've recorded a sleep time it's totally pointless for the sleep tracker now."
I loved this app before. I used the weight management option to successfully lose 12 kgs. But now they have taken that entire option away. The app has become useless now. You should seriously consider bringing back weight management option. It was hands down the best feature if the app.
"I have this app. I use it daily and have for over a year. The problem I have is that I don't think it's accurate 10,000 steps is 7 miles It says. With the steps. If you use the GPS tracker it is only 3 miles. Same app with different results. How is one to know which is really true."
"Free app is somehow still not worth it Checking my pulse on every single finger never gets past 5%, been using the app for years and never had an issue until they deleted all the data and I had to log in again. Can't check pulse or stress levels because it just scans for 5 minutes and never makes progress."
"Broken after recent update, Galaxy S10+. Blood pressure digram for 12 months dissapeared, but says 723 records available. Shows only 1st record i did in February, everything else is missing from graph. Also Together steps menu are messed up, numbers are in 2 columns and not in light with contact names as before, also there is a space line betwwen contact and numbers which come up 1 line bellow"
"I'm not sure what happened with that last update, but the sleep time no longer records correctly. No matter how many times I change it, the time does its own thing and is no longer accurate. Hoping I don't find any other bugs."
"The one thing I do not like is that if you join a challenge after the start of the month, it will not count the steps counted prior to joining the challenge. To me, a monthly challenge should count all steps for the month it is in. In other words, all the steps are counted daily, so why can't those steps be counted?"
"The app is nothing but a way to grab every bit of information from you as they can. Couldn't even get past the set-up because It kept asking for 2 step verification even though I didn't want it or care. I read the terms of service and how they use the data and surprise surprise they sell the information to other companies, they sell your height weight fitness routines diet and every other bit of information you put in and now that I know that I have deleted the app and am leaving this review."
I have been using samsung health for years. It was good earlier with no complains. Neither does Samsung S21 Ultra mobile have accurate steps counts nor the Smart watch3. Its a real dissapointment. We cannot use the heart rate on the watch as it shows not applicable in our region. It was better with the note 8. The steps counts are inaccurate After the updates its even worse. I assume the sensor for s21 arent as accurate as the earlier cell phones.
"Eh, its okay but missing a lot of activities while synced with a watch. I have a Samsung active 2 watch and the workout tracker is helpful, but extremely disappointing in terms of available activities to track. I am extremely athletic, I lift weights (not only machines) Olympic weight lifting, crossfit, rock climbing, sprinting, polymerics, HIIT..... the app has no settings for these types of exercises.... so I find it wildly inaccurate at ""tracking my activity""."
"Useful app to have and links to the Galaxy Watch. Latest update have taken away long term trends. Not an update, a backward step. Downgraded to 2 stars. Just updated to the latest version of watch software March 2021. Samsung what are you doing? Now removed guide frequency from running. Available for walking and hiking still but not running so you can't hear how far you have run. Yet another downgrade and therefore down to one star. Time to go Apple I think."
"This WAS an excellent app with weight management . Someone in samsung had a brain-fart to dumb down this feature. Yes u can see it in Galaxy watch3, but with short battery life of the watch and inconvenience of using it on the watch, I would rather use weight management feature on the phone. Samsung please get it back on the app. Weight managment feature was one of the reasons I chose your watch. Not happy Jan!"
"just got a galaxy watch and just started using samsung health. so far like the app, but wish I could personalize it more. I would like to set it to send a remind me through my watch to get up every hour and do some sort of exercise when I am working. I also wish I could scan foods with phone for easier food logging, and there was a way to monitor blood pressure with watch or by inputting numbers from a BP machine so I could keep a complete picture of my health."
"This app needs to add barcode scanning for the calorie counting. It also doesn't seem to figure any excercise into your remaining calorie allowance for the day. If it did those things, it would be much better, especially since it doesn't play well with any other apps."
"I like to use the sleep tracking function in combination with my smartwatch. I recently upgraded to a Watch 4 and have found that you can no longer edit the length of sleep recorded from your watch , something that used to be possible. So now it records 10+ hours sleep on days I have a lie in and I cannot edit it to remove the time I was awak without losing the rest of the sleep data. A thing that used to be possible I also used to use the caffeine tracker which has been removed"
it's a great experience but I think you should measure the Performance Based on Miles not steps because my friend does a lot more steps but I do a lot more miles and he's ahead of me....... also when it comes time to enter the food many times you have to close the app and restart it to be able to enter a new food happens too often that's why you got four stars......
It would have been more beneficial integrating the oxygen sensor feature into the heart rate monitor rather than moving it to the stress feature. The stress reading takes too long. Many people have relied on it for their treatments. Bad move on your part.
"I've been using this app fairly regularly but the new update has put a complete stop to that. No matter how many times I attempt to sign in to my Samsung account, I get an error message when attempting to open the app. ""Samsung account session expired. Sign in to Samsung account again."" I have set up 2 step verification and signed into my Samsung account successfully to no avail. The app still won't open. Same error message every single time."
"This update is awful, it's not counting my steps correctly, and it tells me I have notifications, but when I try to see whayt they are, it flashes app stopped working! I updated it two days ago, and I know for a fact waking around all day I have walked more steps than what this is saying! Please bring back the old version, this update is a joke, and as many reviews that I've read in the past 5 mins, everyone agrees!"
Since latest update I can't synchronise steps from Garmin (using Health Sync) and the update lost the weight management option which was by far the best feature. I have used Samsung Health since it first began and gave years of data on it showing progress from 103kg to 80kg. But sadly this latest version makes it unusable. I'm switching to MyFitnessPal.
sensory not working ... when trying to check heart rate or any other readings the sensory is horrible. keeps asking to place finger correctly on sensor.. starts to measure and then I get the message again to position finger correctly on sensor. I don't get it! I've tried to use different fingers and still receive same message. find it extremely annoying.
"All works good, except for EKG function."
"This used to be one of the most please fitness/tracking app up until the redesign. So much of the functionality and ease of use has been removed, that you just never really want to go in the app. Simply put the redesign is horrible, I would much rather usd the previous version."
"Good app for watching your general health. I have it paired with my Samsung watch, so get my heart rate & sleep quality monitored to a fairly accurate degree. The floors climbed measurement, however, is a bit hit & miss, I do the same hill twice daily, but get different results after each ascent. Overall. a very useful app for my needs."
How do I get one sleep score instead of an interrupted score. I don't want to see a score for each time I slept. Just give me one score for the whole night.
"The stats for the run tracking w/the Samsung Watch are completely inconsistent with each other. Here's one example: One outdoor run showed splits of 9'51"" and 8'53"" yet my avg showed 9'56"", higher than both individual miles. Furthermore, the graph showing my avg speed appears to show an avg pace of about 4mph while the avg speed based on the dist/time is about 6mph. All runs have shown similar discrepancies. Also, the watch consistently shows several mph slower than all treadmills I've used."
"The app design/look is not bad, but we need to see HRV data in the app - it is quite frustrating that at this point in smart/fitness watches its not. I would also love to see a fasting duration tracker be added, it would just be nice to be able to track a majority of health items in one application with said name."
"After Update If i keep the screen On then its shows me more calories i burned, but if it is in my pocket then its shows me way too low calories I burned in 2km Running."
"Love this watch! With one caveat. And it causes me so much frustration that i will be looking elsewhere. I love tracking my workouts. But it's very frustrating how poor the heart rate monitor is. If you are wanting accurate heart rate tracking, this watch is lacking, or rather the software. Can't imagine their BP tracking will be any more reliable. Such an expensive watch to have such a poorly designed feature. Almost feels like False advertising, with regards to monitoring your heart rate."
"So disappointed that Samsung has just today removed the part of the app that measures O2 saturation. I've been using it for some time and have come to rely on it to find that I need oxygen around the clock. I had a substantial amount of data stored on the app (using the Save button they provided). It's all gone! All of this with no warning. If you find you want to use this app, be very vigilant about keeping your data elsewhere."
"It was great until the update. In order to see steps from my Gear S3, I have to select all steps. This update sucks. Why is this synced device singled out? This device needs to be separated in a bullet by itself just like the Fit Pro. I'm not getting an accurate count of my steps when the kids play with my phone. Both devices count steps. This is just bad!!!"
"I learned that the best way to use the step count is to let it calculate my steps automatically, instead of starting an exercise. The sleep portion could use some work. I changed my wake up goal from 9:00am to 8:30am, but it still says I've met my target if I wake up after 8:30. And some days it doesn't automatically add my sleep time in."
"Invasive and unjustifiable permission demands. I need this app to do one thing and one thing only, keep track of my sleep patterns and physical activity. Data can be stored on phone, or my choice of backup location. I couldn't even access this basic functionality without creating an account! Frustrating, but I went ahead only to find that I have to hand over my phone number for ""2FA"" before I am allowed to use it! Uninstalling and researching alternatives now"
The old version if this app was great. Actually very accurate in counting my steps(yes I checked the counter). However this newer version just won't count the steps. I can work all day very hard and literally walk miles and it will say less then 300 steps for the entire day and only a few minutes of working. I find it more of a discouragement than a motivator.
Good app but had flaws. Especially with sleep tracker. The workout tracking works great including with a GPS route on runs. With the sleep tracker it doesn't show a request to log sleep hours everytime you sleep and sometimes doesn't display your auto sleep and wake time on the app especially when sleeping on night shift. It seems like the app is intended to work with a wake-in-the-morning sleep schedule it doesn't seem to work as well with night shift sleep schedule
"I have had this app on a few phones but ever since I got the Note 10 + it's been nothing but trouble. Its loosing functions left and right, the two I use the most dont work any more and dont even have the option to try to record new event. The o2 and pulse, I know that the o2 was moved to the stress but it wont let me record new event there either. The only thing working is the steps and the water intake."
"Like many, l have used this app for years. The latest update is NOT an upgrade. My issue is with the sleep tracking. What in the world is the sense of putting sleep before midnight with the previous night if I wake at 12:30‚ÄΩ Also, the chunking of sleep means that I no longer get an overview of the entire night."
"App no longer works. I use this app often & today it has reached it's expiration date apparently. It won't load... I've uninstalled it, reinstalled it and it still says the same message, ""Can't open app, Unexpected changes made to your phone..contact customer service."" Really? What does that mean. Apparently it means to deleye it & find a different one."
"The app is simple and easy. I only rate it lowly because changes to terms requires the app to be able to access functions of the phone (such as calls) that there is no reason to have for non sensitive data like my heart rate and calories burnt, very intrusive app in that respect, there is no way for end users to know who gains access to that information, Samsung could simply adjust terms again to allow the selling of personal information and we would never be sure."
"Tried to create an account. Used an email I couldn't do 2factor with, so I couldn't finish creating the account. And now I can't start over. Made a new account online with Samsung, but now the app won't let me start sign-in with a new one that works only the one that doesn't."
Was a decent app where I recorded my weight daily for years till a recent update began giving me only daily trends without the weekly / monthly trends that were available previously. Daily weight trends are not very useful as fluctuations are inevitable. Weekly and monthly trends are much more useful to really determine which direction one is headed!
"I use a Samsung Galaxy Watch Active 2 and the whole experience with Samsung health is very underwhelming. The app or account always checks shows up my previous galaxy watch even though I had removed it from settings. I have the app only as a companion app for the phone, but it seems like the app doesn't really integrate that well with these accessories. Changesade in onedoesnt reflect inthe other."
"Update: Samsung posted a very long response to this comment, which does not, however, address the main point of the negative feedback. Orgininal review: An absolutely horrendous update. The weight management functionality has disappeared. I have been using this app for 3 years and recently bought my second Samsung watch. The update to the app rendered the watch rather useless. Going to switch to Garmin and will actively advise all my friends against the Samsung Health app and Samsung watch."
"love getting the updates, health notifications and challenges. I wish it was able to show me if anyone near me or using same routes as me was also doing the challenges. it's pretty accurate too.. I sometimes find that I am super stressed in a situation and my watch tells me my heart rate is elevated and I should do some breathing techniques... works every time too... nice!"
"one flaw in the program is that you can't manually enter the true calories burned without a fitbit if some sort. It generates calories burned based on time entered and distance, which is inaccurate... you need to add where we can manually add all info so it can be more accurate. Then I'd be happy to give more stars!!!"
"The app has changed so much in recent mths with updates that it is now no longer a health tracker! I can't see how I will benefit from the new layout as it is nowhere near encouraging, it just frustrates me, certain platforms have been removed which has made the layout much harder to read and understand. The watch is fab but that is all it is now a smart watch that you can make and recieve call & text on. Change it back to how it was! Please!"
"Woke up this morning & tried to measure my heart rate as I have done many times before. When I placed my finger on the sensor of my galaxy s10 it would not read it. Naturally, I uninstalled the app and re-installed it to see if there was a glitch. When I opened the app this time the ""measure"" button was gon completly. It appears Samsung just removed this functionality. This feature was a significant reason I still used Samsung over competitors."
"No matter how many times I dink with my smartphone to make this work, after two phone calls to service reps, it still could not count steps. There were times it wouldn't count the steps if I held the phone in one hand, but it would in the other. Sometimes it would have to be in my pocket! Sometimes nothing worked! I don't need that aggravation! They even have the gall to respond to this review and suggest a THIRD way that won't work. THEY need to design an app that WORKS!"
Great application for thank u all samsung team. My experience is good working
"Great APP most of this year. However, several days lately where WALKING minutes not recorded AUTO and minutes still recorded as well as steps November 27-29, past few days only 1/4 of auto walking being recorded. Number of minutes active are consecutive and no breaks but most all minutes walking not being recorded AUTO. I rely on this APP to compare daily, weekly goals and advancement. Please assist."
"Everytime i try to measure ""stress"" it freezes and crashes. I dont like that the SpO2 is now measured through that it. It was better when it was its own thing. Need to be able to type in your own type of workout instead of only the preselect items offered. 5/15/20 call? Really? Will i lose all my saved info if i ""disable"" then try to enable and update?? It cuz its a built in app i cant uninstall and reinstall to maybe fix the crash in the app? You need a reset without losing info"
Great app. It'd a shame I have to use it in conjunction with myfitness pal because this app doesn't offer barcode scanning of food.
bully app. I would like to remove or disable this app. I never signed up for it but it keeps overriding the permissions that I gave for other health apps and devices. it is annoying because they will work fine and then stop syncing. when I go into correct the issue it gives me a message about enabling samsung health and the only way to correct it is to use a computer.
"I don't know about the others. But the new update was more fun and colorful. It made everything smooth. It fixed the previous bugs I complained about. But since morning the bug is back. It says ""REQUEST FAILED"" whenever I try to see the challenge details."
"Update 8/5: dropping to 1 star after they removed half the useful features. Uninstall, thanks a lot. Use this app everyday. A few months ago, the Weekly Summaries stopped working. Called the help line and was told to clear the cache and restart my phone. This only sort of fixed the problem with my most recent weekly summary populating but now it's back to not working even after taking the same troubleshooting steps."
"Overall I enjoy the app but the last week I have constant trouble with the app not opening. It initially loads then just closes pretty much straight away. I have restarted my phone, cleared the data and cache on the app as well as tried skipping the sign up process. This works for a while but then the next day it fails to open again. I am using on a Huawei P30 Pro."
"Why the permissions change? I don't understand why this app all of a sudden need to make phone calls and messages. This is absurd. If I wont allow it, I can't use the app. All the fitness data and tracking of macros is now gone. This is absolutely frustrating. As an application architect, I find this behavior very intrusive. If I Don't give permissions to make calls, turn the features off that use the phone call permissions, y'all just not letting the users in. Please fix it."
"I used to be able to set a walking workout which recorded my steps, kept me informed as to the distance I had covered and the speed at which I was walking. I no longer seem to be able to do this which is very disappointing. I'm not very good on electronic devices so maybe I am at fault. Just wish the app would go back to what it was so I could make better use of it."
Not able to sign in into the app. Click on sign in and it loads forever Tried clearing cache; uninstall and install doesnt work Tried downloading the old version of the app as well i can atleast put my credentials in the old version but still the page just loads infinitely.
"Genius. The application crashes as soon as I accept the privacy agreement, and the response to my review is to use the ""contact us"" menu. But since the application crashes, that option is not reachable. And the email address is a noreply address. So there is no way to make meaningful contact outside the USA."
"Access to contacts?! Unfortunately I updated the app because GPS kept pausing. And now it requires access to my contacts? Heck no, there is no reason for that. Result? App uninstalled! There are too many other options available to keep an app that wants complete access to your data. Ciao."
"Works OK just a couple of gripes: 1. Galaxy Watch shows a map of my exercise route at the end of the exercise data from GPS but this app. does not show & there's no way to manually export from the watch..... 2. Watch sits stationary on a table all night but in the morning, without any movement, I have burnt between 500-700 calories, if only....."
"Bring back calorie tracking now, I haven't use this app in a while and when I started using it again I was bummed that they got rid of it. Every time you walked or run it will count down your calories. Why would you get rid of that Samsung? It was a damn good feature and it helped me lose weight and kept that weight off. Seriously we all need to protest this. Bring it back!!!"
"I walk a alot 25 to 35 miles per week. Although this app is good the one thing that frustrates me the most is if you walk some of the same areas it is hard to determine your route because every mile is the same color except the fastest. I wish it showed a different color for each mile, a different color for the slowest mile."
"App constantly stops counting steps. I've tried deleting the app and reinstalling it, updating it, giving permissions, etc. Can't find any helpful info online. When working properly it's great, but you never know when or why it will stop working. Very annoying."
"Asked for too many permissions just to use the app. Also couldn't start it up. Said it needed permissions for me to use the app, but it didn't tell me which permissions needed to be set. Then when I went in to settings in enabled everything but phone and contacts and still it would tell me I need more permissions. Edit to reply to developers: That does sound reasonable, but you need to make that clear in the app. There's lots of people online refusing to use the app because of this."
"Wish I never updated! I most recently have been using it to track my calories in and out and to maintain weight log. Then I can't open till I grant permission for calls, I don't even want my phone to do that honestly. My previous weights, gone. The look is not user friendly. It shows my calories and my weight loss goal but not working together. Glad I already have a smart watch on the way. I was hoping to use with this app but now I won't."
"This app was great. Now it hangs if I try to 'measure multiple'. Heart rate is fine on it's own, but if you try to use oxygen saturation simultaneously with heart rate it hangs and I have to uninstall- reinstall! BIG Thanks for the quick response to my review of the 'multiple measure' problem . I have confidence you guys will sort the problem in the next update :)"
"No longer creates a map of my biking, kayaking, or walking routes. Not the end of the world but... A little buggy. Almost always says GPS is weak regardless of where I am all while my map apps work just fine. It's just ok. 7-23-2022. Took your advice. Now all my data is gone and it still doesn't display a map or sharable picture of the route. HA! Actually dropped it a star. Oh well."
Got a new Samsung phone. This app has been garbage ever since. It has not recorded my distance once in 2 weeks so it's completely screwing up my running total. I walk 12 km/ day. This app gets stuck on pause for no reason so I have not accumulated 1 km since changing phones. I'm furious. Do not know how to correct this issue. Please help
"04 2021 update is just spyware, once installed if you don't accept the new terms and let it monitor your calls you lose access. Unfortunately BP app summarises its data and the setting can not be changed which makes it almost useless remaining apps are not accurate. If had an idea how useless Samsung developers were when I first started purchasing I would not have bothered. Better off with a Fitbit"
"Update 19 JAN 2021: Helpful user sent me a link to download an older version that included the skip button on the living screen and I was able to successfully sign. Can't login at all through my Pixel 5. After the sign-in screen the little cursor just endlessly spins. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling, clearing cache, clearing data, etc. Why samsung insists on continuing to make their own apps instead of just using Google (I'm looking at you Bixby, Health, Messages, Email, etc.) is beyond me."
My exercise entries keep duplicating in MyFitnessPal. I'll delete the extras and they come back. I've disconnected and reconnected Samsung health multiple times and force closed both apps multiple times. This has been going on for 2 days.
"Since I started using this app on 5G on Samsung Galaxy A11, it's completely weird! 4G shows different work out steps and kilometers and 5G shows less steps and kilometers. If I use Samsung Health indoors, it's shows this difference, however, outdoors, the readings are same. I feel, it's satellite problem that it doesn't catch the movement. For example, if I run indoors, there's difference of almost 2km compared to 4G Samsung Health app."
"Very nice app with continuous feedback to promote physical activity. Eventhough the app automatically picks activity, it can't recognize/ provide feedback if I walk when I chose the exercise ""running"". Similarly, I wish it provides more personalized feedback rather than just the regular, automatic daily cleshes"
"I really dislike the new version of this app. I'm a type 2 diabetic. And I used to really like to be able to see my daily average glucose in a numerical value. But, that was all revamped and moved around. And now there's no numerical value for the averages. Plus, I used to like to see the line graph because it was much clearer than this silly dot graph that they're using now. I really wish they would give us the option to go back to the old look of the app. If it ain't broke..."
"Edit. The watch and app are failing more everyday. It doesn't link eventing and now my watch isn't counting my steps right. I'm so disappointed. I think I'm going to switch to Apple. Also I have sent several reports and all I get back is a atomic message saying I can call, but I can't get through. Don't wast your money The food nutrition is way off. I have to manually enter every, it's really annoying. Please fix it!"
"Great app to start your weight loss project!!!, What I'm a bit disappointed is that I've dived more into intense training and apparently it doesn't have a desktop version of the software to analyse my heart-rate performance. Please advise if otherwise!!! If not I'll end up shifting to other wearables/Softwares. Currently using: - S10 Plus - Gear S3 Frontier - Gear Fit 2 Pro"
"Daily encouragement to stay fit, do the set amount of steps everyday and the app even does other health screenings."
"App has changed, missing/removed features: You used to be able to input a target weight AND get a caloric breakdown showing possible weight loss effects of different calorie targets. The target weight portion, using data from calorie targets, use to calculate approximate dates of when you would reach your weight goals. You used to be able to measure heart rate and oxygen saturation through phones camera flash. The app has been destroyed and gutted."
"The new April 6 version is a big improvement on other updates this year which seemed to be all about pushing Samsung product. There is still an issue with the weight statistics however. How come the minimum weight for a month is less than that for the year? Could also be improved by adding a reward for achieving the wieght target. There are bells and whistles for reaching the sleep target or a new exercise record, but after months of working to my weight target ... not even a happy emoji."
"I tried to stick with this app and I really gave it some time for improvements but instead of improvements it got worse with every update. It progressively got unbearably clunky and even UI design got worse. The last thing I used this app for was weight logging, now I can't even see the list of entries for each month and the graph just became useless. Since my Samsung watch connects to this app I get no use out of the watch or app. I've change the watch and I'm ditching this app."
"There's no conceivable reason why phone permission is mandatory to allow any use of this app. I understand that many people think putting all of your finances or sex life or medical information on Facebook or other social media is fun and a good idea. I don't. I've used some of the features of this app, like step counter, in previous versions. But I guess that's no longer allowed without sharing data with everyone who has my number in their address book. Uninstalled."
"This update is nothing short of dreadful. This used to be one of the valuable apps on my phone. It's pretty much rendered useless now. It's bloated with adware, there is no way to take measurements for heart rate, stress, and oxygen measurements. It doesn't serve any apparent purpose....or maybe that's why they were trying to push the watch when I upgraded the phone. I'll be replacing this with another health monitor."
its a really good app that encompasses many different things so there is no need to have a dozen apps each one function. however the section that logs food and calorie should really have a better way of searching for the food maybe with a barcode scanner. and also because there are so many different functions I find it very strange there's no menstruation tracker
"Disappointed by the latest update. Can we bring back the different time frame view for weight? Right now it is stupid and useless. You cannot see your weight history in a list, and you cannot see how your weight changes through a longer time period. AND, please, RESPECT the user feedback here. Don't tell us to contact support!"
"The app itself is fine for what I use it for,however I don't want it constantly running in the background, as it makes the phone go flat very quickly. Also the data usage is too high, luckily I have been on wifi tonight as 52 meg of data was used in three hours & I wasn't doing much!"
After I updated the app it deleted all the information I had previously done. I give a 0 fix the problem an I might give higher rating.
"The latest update (Jan 2021)is a backward step. The really useful weight features - trends over day, month and year - have gone. Removing useful features is not progress. I have installed another app from Google which does these things and I'm using that instead (Weight Diary)."
It would be better if there were at least options for recording 1/4 servings for better calorie counting. Also if I use other apps for excerise my time and activities aren't counted. It's frustrating. I'm glad I get a general idea but it would be best if I had a real count.
No more weight management. None of the other features really matter when you can't set the caloric intake for weight goals. Total disappointment that it was there one moment and just pulled the next. Is the purpose so now we need to pay for that feature? Also haven't had any of my friend challenges go through.
"Why does it always suggest sleep times off by 10-20mins? I have my wake up ringing, I stop it, leave bed, put my watch on, all that within the same minute right after the wake up. I check the app while eating breakfast and it suggests times that are off by at least 10mins each way. I can understand time for falling asleep, but funny enough, this one is extremely accurate. You would think that wake up would be since you have to physically touch your phone and your watch tracks your steps."
"Tracks My Steps So Well! My blood pressure, heart beats per seconds and body BMI. Walk to Work and Back Thru House Till End of The Day. I hit 10,000 steps using mobile service on my phone and home WiFi. This is so great!!!! I am happy to own it and use it. Tracks my food choices that I eat for the day, water intake, reminds me to wash my hands, stress levels, when I go to sleep, when I wake up in middle of the night,and goes back to sleep! This band is such great and useful!"
great app. love being able to keep track of excercises and steps in real time. the food and calorie trackers are invaluable. only thing i would suggest to the developers is the ability to suggest exercises in app. i use a vertical climber daily and unfortunately i can't find that exercise nor the ability to suggest adding it.
This was a very good app before the update but now it's very confusing. I cannot understand why the feature to manually create My Food has been removed how can this be considered accurate if accurate data can no longer be input into the app. Also the addition of a bar code scanner would be awesome.
"The 2 step verification is bugged. There's an option to skip it, but then it produces an error and brings you back to the 2 step verification screen. The passcode sent from Samsung will not verify. Also, now they want more access into the phone. There are better, hassle-free aps out there."
"It was good until I got a new phone. Now after a while synchronization with my Galaxy watch active 2 stops working after a while. So I have to reinstall the app, or reboot both devices to make it synchronize. And I have to do it several times a day. It's really frustrating."
"Hi, the Galaxy Watch 4 is awesome when you're able to use all the hardware that it comes with, but with features region locked to certain phones for reasons I as a consumer couldn't care less about frankly, it's not as good. I have my own ways around that, but this app as is with these pointless restrictions in place deserves one star for the lockout and won't get a fair shake from me until then. Thanks!"
"I have the smart watch and I like it better than Fitbit, except no period tracker. I dont want to have to use both wearable devices so I will need to choose one and right now since they track everything I think Fitbit will be the winner in the end. Once Samsung starts tracking periods, which is very important health wise, I will come back."
"Three things 1. Needs a reminder that asks you to drink water along with ability to edit the amount you have drank. 2. It automatically records when you turned screen off and asks next day if you were sleep in that time and it is good but some people sleep during day or take naps. It should ask whether the times with screen off for more than a duration fixed by user - say half an hour or two hour, were spent sleeping. 3. More widgets please - for adding water drank, showing charts etc."
"Have loved this app for years now with my samsung watches. But in the last week or so the heart rate monitor tracking has changed... not sure why but it's not as accurate. My hr is showing in the hourly slots it's been upto 140bpm and in the graph it's only showing that it's gone upto 116bpm. Also the graph is all one colour now, not the original 3 colours to show different rates. If possible please change it back to how it was before... thanks üôÇ"
Good app. Would love if I could zoom in on my heart rate graph and see the times hour by hour to pinpoint when I may have been stressed or something instead of guessing the times. Currently it only shows tiny dots on 6 hour intervals and is hard to read. Other than that it is a good app.
"It is a great app which I've used before but since I've got the Samsung A40, I'm not sure if its the case it what but it doesnt count my steps or anything. I actually have to wave my phone up and down so it counts them. Can be a little buggy at times ,but excluding them facts, it is a great appüíé. Please try suggest like touch sensitivity if it helps or improve the movement. Thanks üòÄ"
I wish there was to way to use this in another language while my phone uses a different one. I don't want to change my phone language but I need to choose food from a specific part of the world and this app only shows the ones from the default country!
This worked great until recent update. Now I can't sync my gear watch or have it track anything. I can't even see my programs and I haven't been able to configure and verify the together portion of the app. I don't want to just reinstall it bc it told me it would delete everything from before the update.
"Edit: Tried to reinstall. App now requires phone&contacts access to supposedly use a feature that I don't want & won't use. Samsung, if true, please make the feature optional! --- Used to be a useful app, but now I get a continous pop-up error telling me that Samsung Health has crashed again. This happens on average once a minute! Closing the app doesn't help, even force stopping the app, still won't stop the crashing and popups. Sadly, after several years, I am now uninstalling Samsung Health."
"Definitely not allowing phone permissions. A ridiculous intrusion on my phone info. Obviously it doesn't make calls. Perhaps some people would like a health journey of their own and do not desire to give access to add friends/contacts for the ""together"" feature. Perhaps some people would not prefer to have the device identifier given to Samsung Health. Honestly, the condescending tone of replies these days... Just suggesting ""hey, it would be nice to use the app without forced permissions."""
"AWFULLY WORSE THAN EVER. I guess the new developer is a woman cos they replaced with last update the very useful weight management with a period track option..The tracking is not working, the cycling and the running dont count any calorie burn, only the time and sometimes, if lucky, the  miles.I reported the issues many times and recently it seemed that finally, after 6months, they fixed the cycling tracking but after a few days it doesn't work again!! Losing hope and doesn't seem they even care"
I wish the treadmill option had an incline. I burn over 1000 calories on the treadmill but it calculates less than half. other than that this app has helped me track my progress in a fun interactive way with their goals and challenges. I've been using consistently for a few weeks now and have gone from 268lbs down to 249lbs. I feel if I weren't tracking with this app I wouldn't have progressed as fast.
"Was fine until it stopped syncing to my Strava account (last successful on 27th Aug). I've contacted support twice about it. First time they instructed me to reset featured apps (Strava is not in the featured apps...). Second time they had me close, flush cache and reinstall both Strava and Samsung Health, none of which helped. There's no way to manually trigger sync, no feedback of progress or status of sync in the app and no (visible) log off sync activities, which doesn't help. (From UK)"
"In the latest update it got much worse. I use weight, before I could choose to see it by week or month averages high and low. Now it shows only per day, and the chart part is now so small it is useless. As the app is now it is useless for me. Please bring back previous functionality and look."
"Bummer - Used to use this App. all the time until the update. Can't use it because I do not want them to have full access to my phone including contacts and camera. I agree with the other former users, there is no reason for it. I have a Samsung phone, tablet and TV and I am disappointed with Samsung by this new development. Can't do anything with this app. anymore including the optional questions."
"Rooted Phone!?!? This app is rendered useless 2-3 times a month because of rooted phone issues. It constantly disconnects from myfitness pal which is causes me to lose data and time. Don't waste your time. Update 5/10/2019: I unistalled and reinstalled the app, it seems to be working better than before. I will update my review to reflect the current version if this keeps working well."
"Was great until one day it stopped working, telling me it wouldn't work on a rooted phone. My phone isn't rooted, even ran a root checker to be sure. Thanks but no thanks, I'm not calling a non-free number from NZ. I'll just not use the app.  Edit: Worked around issue by installing version 4.0 then updating. Turns out Knox is tripped. And Samsung kneecap you for this."
"Since the last update I get a constant phone battery usage warning. This app is the biggest user of my battery even though I rarely open it, it looks like it's running some background services to monitor footsteps and there's no way to disable this unwanted feature. I like my Samsung Sport, but this is enough for me to recommend that none of my friends but one. Also, if by default you're going to enable notifications for annoying features, could you restrict them to sensible hours? Getting woken up at 6am by a notification asking if I want to increase my step goal isn't as fun as your marketing team might think."
"*UPD: Looks like a patch was rolled out, and after the update, the app is functioning again. Installed the app, it gets stuck after login screen, just keeps loading with no result. I can see this is a problem for other users too. UPD: Developer recommendation does not work, app still not loading. Please fix this bug ASAP, it's very frustrating to not be able to use my new smartwatch as intended."
"The watch doesn't work as it did in the beginning.. The ECG no longer automatically sends to your phone if you check it. There's no way to see any ECG's done in the app or be able to send them to your doctor like you're supposed to be able to. What happened? Where do results go? It's not mentioned or shown in any screenshots on the Google app store either. Yet the watch still says, ""View this ECG in the Samsung app on your phone."""
"Samsung, listen to your customers. Remove the Phone and Contact permission requirements. I don't want app to have my contacts in order for me to enjoy a feature that was great already great to begin with. Why? Hey and don't dare reply with the garbage that these permissions only enable the usage of features that were already available without the contact permission. Also, don't say that no info is shared. That's not what anybody wants."
"I've only had the Active 2 watch since August 21, prior to which there seemed no point using the app. It all worked great until just recently where I cannot go back and enter my weight more than a day prior, if I try it crashes so i have had to enter weight as today which is irrelevant and then doesn't give a clear picture as to what is working in my regime and what isn't"
"I have been trying to connect my new S active 2 watch to my phone One plus 6T. S wearable app works fine however, I can't sign into the samsung health app. Every time I try to sign in to sync my phone, it asks for credentials and after entering it, there is a blank loading screen and it's stuck on the same forever. I have already cleared cache. There is no option of signing in without credentials and then entering the credentials at a later state after the application is loaded."
When I first started using the app I loved it. I could keep track of my oxygen levels and heart rate without having to log it into a notebook and carry it to the doctor's office each it I went. The app was just so convenient as well as accurate. With the new update was hope these two item was back listed.
"It worked great on my 8+. Now, on my Z-flip, the heart rate monitor won't activate. No start/record button. On the 4th, and final, download/install, it didn't even include a heart rate monitor. I try to stick with Samsung apps. Not this time."
Used to like the app and would hav rate higher. Unfortunately the recent update messed up the usability. The running function no longer detect the speed n distance as it used to be. got ridiculous running speed n distance which is impossible last sunday right after upd the app. The sleep notification appear every morning but when click in to upd more accurate timing the time is BLANK. Hope samsung fix it asap!
"Can't use it in a phone without a sim? That's stupid. I'm trying to save the battery of my main phone and need to run it on this device but I can't because it's got no sim? Pure bs. Thanks for the worthless reply. There is no relationship between ""a sim card"" and syncing through wifi especially when have the time the app, my headphones, and my watch count my workouts in triplicate. It would be easier to let users use the app the way they want instead of giving use lip service when when can't"
"The app is excellent and good But it is kind of weird that I am getting different stats in different devices, if I turn on running on both my Samsung mobile and watch active 2 at the same time and turn it off after the a running workout, the number is calories seems do be really high in mobile and way lesser on the watch, the elevation is also different. It is already a great app, by fixing those issues this would be the best app Good work Samsung Dev team"
"Updated on April 26, 2021 - downgrading the experience to 2 stars because: 1. No response from any of the ""development"" team or any improvement on the upgrades. Food continues to be uneditable, with no possibility of deleting foods you can't use. 2. The use of the Samsung phone sensor to measure heart rhythm, oxygen levels, etc., has now been totally discontinued. 3. Totally useless responses from whomever is reading this The latest update did away with a lot of useful features along the lines o"
"LOVED this app but recently it's stopped automatically syncing with my galaxy watch. I have to disconnect and reconnect my Bluetooth multiple times per day and let the app sit on the syncing screen for 5-10 mins at a time just to hopefully have it connect, and just sometimes it won't update with my watch information at all. EDIT: The developer response and provided solution worked! Super simple and now the app is back to working perfectly - back to 5 stars!!"
"Horrible log in process - lost my account and paid apps because of it - Samsung support replied that's its essentially my fault. You're the ones making it so complicated! Plus I can not connect my galaxy watch to the app nowadays - multiple phone and device resets, no result. The app itself is poorly designed - poor sports tracking system. I've switched to fitbit and its massively better."
"It good and I've been using this app for years! Only problem is I can change my calorie goal. I manually change it, but then it defaults to a really low target and says I'm severely over eating! I obviously set a goal years ago, but i can see how to override it."
Extremely disappointed that the Weight Management feature has been removed. It was pretty accurate and one of the main features I enjoyed with this app when paired with a Samsung watch. Will be looking elsewhere in the future for wearable/fitness tech if this feature doesn't reappear.
Hopefully you can help me. I had a very poor experience with Samsung chat. I got bad direction and rest all my app notifications settings. How can I sync up my watch and Samsung health phone to show same miles walked. It effects this 3rd party challenge app. I only get credit for what app says not watch
"the app keeps saying that it cant run on a ""rooted"" phone, but my phone isnt rooted or modified in any way. now its started opening itself and popping up with error boxes while im in other apps. I had to uninstall it so it would stop interfering with other apps. it's a shame, because its definitely the best fitness app out there"
"This app used to be awesome. But then an update was pushed which keeps on asking to setup 2 step verification. It was an annoying step, but since declining it would render the app useless so I went ahead with the 2 step verification thingamajig. It asks for my mobile phone number, I input the same and receive the OTP. I input the OTP and tap the relevant button. Behold! I'm taken to the screen where the app tells me to setup 2 step verification. Seriously... what is this?"
"For the meal tracking, I love that it saves my individual food and meals BUT it doesn't give exact carbs or fat unless I add up each category on my own. The last version gave grams for all three macros. To find protein, I have to scroll down and click Learn More. This update is totally tone deaf to be released in January when most people are trying to get back on track with their nutrition. TERRIBLE TERRIBLE UPDATES."
"I have been a user of this app for several years and downgraded to an earlier version wheb a previous update cut the daily trend option for step counts. As of November 8th, my daily step-counts accrue accurately, but are not archived. Despite my permission settings my steps are erased at the end of each day. This app was originally excellent but declines with each upgrade. Beware if you use it for your daily step-count, you will enjoy your results for only a single day. No tracking of averages."
The app has improved a lot since last two years. The problem I am facing is to add a glass of water everytime when I drink. It's always difficult to open the app and an entry I would love to have a widget for adding a glass of water. It will save much time and will help to add water consumption easily.
"Needless Intrusion of Privacy. This app wants access to your photos, phone, and contacts among others. It worked fine before this ""upgrade"", it can do so again without them. Very unfortunate, I won't be using this as I really liked it before it became Spyware."
"Can't edit the no of steps walked. This is unacceptable. I don't always want to go on a walk with my phone or watch or sometimes i forget. When you come back from the walk, there should be a way to edit the no of steps taken which is not there. Adding a prev. exercise manually does not alter the step count (seriously). How can someone do a walking exercise without additional steps! This is nonsense and I am forced to use another app on top of this app which is more cumbersome and a disaster!"
"Used to really like this app. The update is invasive and doesn't allow you to opt out of the requirement to provide access to phone, contacts, etc. I really don't care if that ""optimizes"" the app, I shouldn't be obligated to give access to those things just to have a glorified pedometer. I immediately deleted the app."
"Samsung replied to my previous review saying this should work. It does not. During 2 step verification and after inserting phone number, i receive a text with a code. The app correctly picks the code from the SMS and inputs it, then when i try to continue i get sent back to the initial blue screen. This happens every time, always thrown back to the initial 2 step verification screen. Samsung Galaxy S8 plus."
"I have used this app for a few years and it always used to work fine, but not anymore. My steps are counted, but the 'auto detect' isn't. For exemple I walked 12kms today doing about 17000 steps, but the auto detect only registered 36 minutes of activity and 2.5kms. This is very frustrating as I have goals for the months. I have looked on forums, but all that comes up is about the watch which I do not have. Help centre isbuseless as the answers are badly translated and make no sense what so ever"
"Hi there, Thanks for responding with a helpful answer, I really do appreciate that. I'm unable to find any ""Measure Multiple"" option in the app. When I check ""Notices"", they're displayed in French... I got my Note8 in Australia through my carrier (Optus), it's never been overseas and the only languages I have setup are English (AU & US). I can't change the language the notices are displayed in either. I really don't know what to do next, could you please give me some insight here? Thank you!"
The changes they made to the interface is awful. Bring back the old interface with the nutrient percentages. Also bring back the meter that tells you if you are under or over your calorie intake. Will be looking for another app that resembles the old look of Samsung Health.
"I don't think this app is very good at all. Sleep data are not as accurate as with Fitbit (for example, my Samsung watch never records my REM sleep), and I keep having to define my most likely exercise types when the app has updated. There's no 'weights workout' option other than 'weights machines'. It's disappointingly poor."
"Previously 5 stars, it'll stay as 1 while it's unusable and keeps crashing (at least 20 times in 2 hours). I use it to record steps and kms walked. It's pretty useless when i can't get it to work on walks. Even the update i just did hasn't fixed it. What's happened?!"
"UPDATED: The app has gone from bad to worse. It's like Samsung have an agenda almost. I've downgraded my app to the July 2020 version and turned off auto update. No doubt it'll stop working eventually but the latest version of this app is absolutely atrocious. Old review below Why have you removed Weight Management? I have lost considerable weight because of this app, being able to track my calorie deficit was invaluable. Absolutely no communication from Samsung about this change. What a joke!"
"I love the challenges this app does every month. I like how you can keep track of your sleep, calorie intake, coffee as well as your water intake. What I don't like about this app is when I bought a new phone it lost my account. I had to start all over and my progress was lost. That is why I only give it a three star."
I like the app but it's calorie tracker leaves a bit to be desired. I actually link it to my old under armour app because I like their teacher much better. Foods are searchable online and you can create a personal database so you aren't constantly trying to calculate everything yourself. They also have a QR scanner to make tracking easier.
Used the app for a while but I don't like the new design. I was also disappointed when the calorie tracker which showed your calorie balance after taking away burnt calories. I thought this feature was very good definitely made it easier to see my total calorie balance for the day.
"Displays ads on the top third of the screen and cannot be removed, opted out of, or canceled. Otherwise its a great app. Shame that I will be looking elsewhere for smart watches as Samsung has great hardware. Update: Samsung sent a form response auto generated from a low star review that did not acknowledge their choice to insert intrusive and forced ads into all their native apps. Really poor form and response from a company selling $1000 phones."
Continuous monitoring does not work well on galaxy watch 5. It was MUCH better on my old galaxy watch 2.
I use this app on the note 9 with gear watch. The steps walked never matches between the two. I also have a note 4. Where I use this app. Also there the steps walked count does not match between the two devices. The altitude meter which counts the floors climbed is total waste junk. After climbing a say ten floors it will record as one. I have seen other products which even records the number of times we sit and stand up. I got a reply from the developer asking to clear cache. I did that and climbed five floors and the watch and the phone both show as one floor.. Looks like they need some lessons on this from Huawei
"Last few days not counting steps correctly or tracking sleep correctly, probably other things I haven't noticed yet, please fix!!"
"Hi I always prefer buying Samsung over other phones because of this app and the camera features. But now after the last update there's something I really wanted to get back. Which is the way weight records was when we could see all the weights for the month and the highest, medium and lower weight for each month.. please get this back ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I was starting to have a healthy weight because of this."
"Not sure if it's the recent update but today my step count isn't syncing properly. It's missing about 1/2 my count. I tried syncing it several times. Restarting my devices. Nothing is working. 07/25/2020 Got me moving again. I didn't realize how stagnant I became after having our last child over 3 years ago which is also when I started working from home. Now I'm more conscious about how much water I'm drinking, how much food I'm eating, and how active I've been throughout the day. It's helped.."
Before the latest update it was a good app. But now it doesn't sync with My Fitness pal calorie counter. This means my steps aren't exported and my calries aren't. This is the second time this has happened after an update and I am disappointed. I now that samsung health counts calories but not to the same depth as my fitness pal for example you can't put in receipies and divide them down into number of servings or anything.
"After the last update, the app disappears from the notifications area which counts the steps basically ... my phone and my watch both are Samsung so I don't think it's about app optimization with phone, please solve this major problem..."
"I love the app. It has everything I need with no extra costs. However, I wish we still had the weight control feature. Also, I love my galaxy watch and that it syncs my activity to the Samsung health app.. however why doesn't the activity heart from my watch, transfer to the app like Apple does with their activity rings? The green dots on the calendar for exercise are dumb. I'd rather see my activity heart on the calendar instead."
App is becomes very boring. One of the many issue is you can only challenge 1 person and not a group. Then there was a point in time where I had friends added in my list but after a while they all disappear. Also exercises are limited and exercises lags a lot and video wont play. Lastly they dont have VO2 max. Been a samsung fan ever since but now I am giving away my samsung smartwatch and will start using garmin vivoactive4 and their app. Samsung RnD needs to step up before its too late.
Can't see the option to see Sleep Score anymore. Sleep Tracking as a function is close to obsolete. There is no sync between the Watch's measurements and the app. Even after syncing it still shows two different measurements. Please fix ASAP. Edit : No response from the Samsung Team. Been over a week.
Cell created updates and now I'm no able to open the application üòî
"I was really enjoying this app. However, for a few weeks now the steps don't automatically count. Also, when I try to track a workout like cycling or running if keeps closing. I'm not too impressed. I sent an error report, but haven't received any feedback."
"The app was awesome at the start when I first started using it years ago, however more and more they are discontinuing many of the features I liked about the app...caffeine tracker, the community share section, the ability to track other vitals and now the articles section as of today. On top of that even though I won the last two one on one challenges I was competing in, it glitched and recorded them as losses messing up my stats. This app is no longer enough to keep me with Samsung!"
"Since I have a Samsung phone and a Galaxy Watch, this app is perfect for my health tracking needs. More recently, I started using the weight and food tracking options as well. This is great but why can't weight be recorded in lbs and oz? This is frustrating that I have to convert the ounces to a decimal of the pound and more challenging when looking at the weekly summary. Any chance of this getting modified as most scales record weight in pounds and ounces?"
"I hate this new update the most. I have been using the weight management section to track my calorie management. It used to be the more you worked out the more calories you knew you could have for a day, and they have gotten rid of this completely.I lost almost 50 lbs using this feature, now its gone and it is so disheartening. Yes I could manually try to figure it out but this used to make my busy life so much easier. I hope they realize the mistake and bring back the weight management section"
"Samsung should do a much better job with this app. I've removed my historic comments, as they are no longer relevant. However, the app is still a poor offering, wth peoples comments, and the overall rating for the app, reflective of same."
"Can this nutritional info section be changed back to how it was a few updates ago? I used to be able to see the total grams I've eaten in the food summary area. Now I have to click on the nutritional info to see it and I cannot see all the items at once there (I have to scroll to the different sections). Also, this may be nitpicky for me, but change the color back to yellow on the Food home section when the amount is low. Two green colors dont look good."
"This is a really good app for tracking food, exercise and over all health. The only thing I would add to it, is the option to take a picture of ingredients on foods and supplements that are not listed in the search bar. This would allow more accurate meals and supplements added as well as adding more foods and supplements to the search options for every user."
"It was OK until the update. Now it wants too much access. I'm not planning on allowing it access to ""make and manage phone calls."" And the reasons it gives for *needing* this are nonsense. Hell no. Unless this is fixed and I can still use the app without this I will be deleting the app. I will also be considering dropping Samsung altogether. There is no reason for the app to *make phone calls*!!!!!! There is no reason to *manage* my phone calls either. And I don't want a bot response."
"The app no longer tracks calories burned throughout the day. In the food section the carbs, fats and proteins bar are all similar in color so it is impossible to tell them apart. There is no longer an option to go back to older versions either thru your settings."
"Heart rate monitor (HRM) does't work during running workouts with Samsung watch active2 and watch3. Feature works with Galaxy fit. To reproduce the problem, I press the running man icon on the home page under ""exercise"". Wait 30s. Galaxy fit shows ""HRM connected"" on the top left corner under ""Detecting..."" No HRM connection when using active2 or watch3. All watches are listed as registered accessories. I've tried factory resetting all watches, reinstalled Galaxy wearable and Samsung health."
What are Samsung playing at? They have 3 optional boxes but the app will not run if you do not agree. That is not an option at all. I absolutely do not agree to anyone having the info they want as I don't need their help. Just leave me with basic functionality. I can't even delete the app.
I bought the Samsung galaxy watch for my horseriding tournaments and the aesthetics of the rose gold 42mm to wear it daily. Unfortunately the smart watch widget is not accurate (including the pace).. the built in GPS doesn't work without the phone .. there is a horse riding option in the phone app that does show on watch's widget options. I like the watch but it just doesn't live up to it abilities .. I wish I never bought it and would love to return it back for a refund as it's useless to the claims provided.
"Loved this app last year. It kick-started my fitness push. All that came to a juddering halt in the first week of April. It no longer counted my steps. After uninstalling and reinstalling twice, still no counts. Finally uninstalled permanently. Thanks for the glitch,Samsung."
It is frustrating that Samsung Health and Samsung Health Monitor are separate apps and that the monitor app is only available on Samsung phones.
I mostly do swimming and use galaxy watch4 to track workout. Style recognition is 90% wrong! No accumulative workout time when viewing lengths (should be basic). No pause during workout tracking. I'm not even going into HR zone monitoring- awful (30 minutes in anaerobic/maximum zone). My 70$ amazfit watch did a much much better job tracking. Very disappointed.
"It's okay. I've tried logging workouts with Samsung Health native app on my Active 2 watch, and I've also tried with the MapMyRun app. The GPS position on both is less accurate than I'd like (even with ""high accuracy"" enabled""). Some things that would be nice additions: 1) Add a gear tracker, so I can keep track of the mileage on my shoes. MMR has this feature, but it's a pain in the ass to use (need to use the web interface post-workout, if the activity is started from the watch). 2) Add the ability to customize the max heart rate (rather than the standard 220 - age). The workaround now is to fake my age to move the heart rate up, so the heart rate zones are more representative. 3) Improve integration with MMR. Allow cross communication of GPS data between apps. 4) Improve GPS accuracy. This is just a lob in for the Active 2 watch, in case Samsung is paying attention. It's not super great."
I really like this app so far. I have been using it for a month so far. It has almost everything a person could need to help track their daily health journey. The only thing I wish this app had is the capability to scan barcodes on the foods that we eat so that we can add them to our food tracker. It gets difficult and time consuming to search for the item that you are eating; other than that i think this app. Give me a scan option and they will get their 5 stars!
"Today this app forced me to give my phone number (""serving"" it as an account ""security""). Sorry but if I didn't want to have a two-step verification?? While refusing this option the app just show again the message ""update the acc security - turn on two-step verif"". So I was forced to give my phone number and to turn on the two-step verification, even if I didn't want to, just in order to continue track my weight and my activities cause it happened to me to have a Sams watch. Crazy! Unfair!"
"They ask me to install four apps, because the watch (Samsung fit2) needs 2 plug-in apps, one devices app and another for pair and layout. After that my devices doesn't work it remains on the main screen only and don't do anything. After that I uninstall and reinstall everything it works. Now it's ok but please make an unique app and solve the numerous bugs."
"No possibility to edit/truncate sleep records. E.g. when sleep registered incorrectly in time when in fact I was awake should be option to cut off part of sleep record. As well too many awakes are shown during sleep what was proven with other tools and external observer. No possibility to edit this data or adjust sensitivity of the tool. As an additional comment - connection with other (external) applications is getting much worse, so less flexibility for users. Seems Samsung goes wrong way."
"The only negative is that it cannot be paired with third party apps such as Fitbit. And I find the new menu less intuitive than the old one. Other than that, good app. Update: After the reply from the Samsung Team underneath, I contacted the department and they could not find a solution to the issue. I need to contact the developer team"
"There is a bug with the body composition graphs - if you set it to display a time period, 7 days for example, the graph doesn't pull data for the dates requested, it just pulls the previous 7 recordings. This is an issue, because if you don't record your weight every day, the graphs will display data that is outside the date range requested. Also, the x-axis on the graph is not actually spaced by date; the measurements are just spaced evenly, even if the times between recordings arent equal."
"I am very disappointed that the O2 measurements have been removed. I suffer from COPD and relied on this feature to monitor my O2 during the day, especially after exercising. The stress indicator does not provide an accurate measurement and there is no way to track O2 trends. This was the most important feature for me aside from the step tracker. As I read many of the other reviews, I see that many other people feel the same way. Please update the app to include the O2 reading separately."
"Have been really using this app alot over the past year and really enjoyed it, however the recent changes are really not great. Looks much more bland and for some reason the feature that showed your 'micro' nutrients has been removed. Not sure why and found it really useful before. Hope you change it back as has been really good good."
"I've used this app for over 4 years. I use it to track my steps, bicycle riding and activity times. I am displeased that it has stopped differentiating healthy steps, and that it will no longer track my heart rate and oxygen level. I have no interest in competitive challenges, food or sleep tracking so I think the app has gone from GREAT to just good."
March 2021 update... sucks!!!!. New graphics sucks!!. The weigh track graphs is gone and it was great. You should reconsider getting back to the previous version. I do not like ir any more. I was using it for 3 years and I hate the new up date. You lost another costumer.
"Decent app but it's lacking some useful features. I like tracking water but sometimes I find myself not having had some in a few hours. A reminder would be nice to have when nothing has been logged. Also, I would love to scan food using upc to speed things up or add regular foods together but not make it a custom food item."
"The older version worked fine on my pixel 3xl. But the new update combined with my new Pixel 4a, I cannot even log in. I enter my username and password and it just spins on a loading page. I am not sure how to contact support because the email listed is a NoReply. 1 star. Edit: clearing the cache did not help. Logging on to the website did not help. Uninstalling and reinstalling did not help. I waited a week or so and they must have fixed the bug. The app seems to work now. Updated to 4 stars."
"I totally agree with the other users The update that use to O2 sat separately for me was useful . To take it away and combine it into the stress test function, is totally useless. It is always off by 2-3%. Heat rate also varies. At least provide a 2nd method. Unless you are not able/or don't have any aptitude to fix the latest update"
"Constantly stops tracking my steps with zero warning. Have to restart the whole phone to get it to switch back on again, which I did yesterday morning only for it to fail again 24 hours later. Limited number of widgets available compared to other health apps. The food search function is fairly poor for matches ie if you search ""tomato"" a single fresh tomato is the 18th result. The only benefit is the macro breakdowns are quiet nice."
I like using the app. But it needs allot more money put into the development side of things and I hope samsung realise this. Especially as new smart watches keep coming out. It's just not there yet with the fitness side of things. Monthly stats rather than weekly would be useful as well.
"Old version had more options. In the new updated version you cannot manually add an excersice you had done on a previous day. You cannot add how many calories you have burned or the duration of exercise. This version, unless you start recording the excersice, it won't count towards your goals. Google Fit has manual add of exercises but it does not make you of your heart monitor on the phone."
I really wish they would have the option to view the entire history and weekly/monthly trends. I like how fitbit does it but I got a samsung watch. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è seems like a lot of other folks are frustrated by the updates too. Also wish we could scan barcodes for diet tracking. Otherwise it suffices.
The newest update is terrible! Now I can't view exercise repetition totals by months. Awful data review interface update. A big step backwards in overall app functionality. 8/10 - update my review to 1 star. I keep finding more ways this app has been feature stripped. You can't adjust your sleep data that is imported from Samsung Gear anymore. Hardly feature rich. More like stripping features and user customization. 1/17/21 - every update strips more and more features. Weight tracking nerfed.
"This was a really good app, until they decided they needed access to my phone calls. Everytime this app upgraded they want more and more access to your information, and yet 3 other apps i found work perfectly fine without access to my calls, texts, photos, etc. I ended up unistalling it. I would redownload it if i could have it without giving access everything and my spleen."
limited by not interfacing with other fitness apps. The calorie/food counting part is limited and should be interfaced with my fitness pal for more meal options. There is no way to export activities into other fitness trackers and vice versa. this could be a great app and the Samsung gear hardware could be great if it interacted with other apps. Definitely will be sticking with my Garmin from now on.
"Taking away stars as I often have issues with it syncing. Also Samsung removed the SPO2 tracking feature with no warning and said they will not be reimplementing it (unless you're in the US) which is completely moronic! Not long ago there was an article stating how smart watches can and have saved lives with their BP and SPO2 trackers, but the way Samsung is going they won't unless you buy a 2nd fitness device like a Fitbit or take the more sensible option and switch to Apple."
I have been using this app every day and have contacted Samsung several times. The steps counter keeps stopping about twice a week and I do all the things they say but always have to uninstall the app and reinstall. It is very annoying when you walk every day . So unless you sort this out I will need to start using another app
It was great until this latest update. Now I can't even get it to start for me. Keeps telling me to sign in and when I try I get an error about Samsung account already in account manager. My problem may relate to my having an older phone so I don't want to give it a terrible rating but I do wish developers of all apps would make versions of their apps for older phones.
I like the streamlined design. I just don't like that you can't scan barcodes to input meals or use the search bar to search restaurants to be as accurate as possible to calculate calorie intake. It's the one part of the app that's useless.
"Used to love this thing, but for so.e reason they removed the calorie counter from being a visible widget. Probably gonna have to use my fitness pal or something"
The app has worked great until my last Samsung 21 update (G991U1UEU5DVL1) done 1/18/23. Now sleep chart is not longer working.
Cant get ECG recording even after doing all troubleshooting. What's the point of having it if it cant do basic functions?
After the most recent update the app is less useful. First it now requires 2FA which is fine but trying to enable this was buggy and I had to try 5 times before it worked and didn't hang up during the text code validation step. It seems you can no longer manually add activities you've done which is annoying as my Samsung Smart watch auto setting is often inaccurate with what it records. It's a shame because it used to be a decent app.
"I'd like to switch to a Samsung Active2 Watch, but when downloading the app, I can see that there's no way to upload past data from another health source, no scanner to scan barcodes for food, etc. I'm not sure I'm willing to make the switch if there's no way to upload past history."
"*Edit: Instead of improving, the app actually has decreased in quality. They have removed the weight management function so I am now only able to set a weight goal and input weight. It will no longer help set calorie intake based on the weight goal. I have to manually input my calorie goal every time I log food throughout the day because it won't save my goal. It keeps resetting to 1239. I got a Gear 3 watch specifically for this. I'm starting to think I wasted my money."
"Keeps crashing my phone when it updates/sync. I don't wear my watch that often, but it's daily updating/syncing. My watch is 100 miles away an powered off, this stupid app updates/syncs! I like the watch to work properly when I wear it so I won't delete the app, but if this doesn't get fixed, I may go for a different watch supplier"
"This app is incredible! It makes it much easier for people who don't have an active lifestyle to take control of their health within their own terms, at their own pace, and free of major commitments without any extra costs. It's not just for people looking to get fit, run a marathon, or go to the gym every week- it's for ANYONE! Simply using it to record your vitals, measure stress levels, analyze sleep and the distance walked each day is life changing in itself. No effort req'd, only 5 min/day!"
"UPDATE: Samsung suggestions did not fix the issue. Still not synching. App won't synch information from my watch. Watch is connected to phone. App says watch is connected and all settings are turned on to take data from watch. Step counts, workouts, heart rate...NONE is being uploaded from watch to the app. Still doesn't work. (GALAXY S22 w/ Active 2 watch)"
"App is totally unusable. Installed it for the first time last night and set up the two-factor authorization and got stuck in a loop of it forcing me to set it up again, which produced an error. Reinstalled and tried logging in with two-factor already set up and it tried to make me set it up again. Can't get into the app at all."
"Data transfer, why won't it let you download your blood pressure data"
"Love it! Bought a Galaxy Fit-e wearable and got it all connected up to Samsung Health, all the info syncs in a matter of seconds with accurate reporting of steps, active time, sleep (even naps!) and there is yet more to discover! Love wearing the band to get useful stats and these are nicely presented in the app. Also reports back data correctly to apps (I use Vitality) so I can earn points/rewards. A complete app to manage all aspects of health really. Much better than the other apps I've used."
"I like the app mostly. But for some reason the app doesn't seem to count all steps and is really slow at counting steps at times. I already deleted cache and restarted phone. Also use the Samsung watch, that goes by my arms movements. My phone is usually in my pants pocket. So not sure why it's not counting all steps. And there should be a workout that includes cleaning house lol. But could you figure out why it's slow and not counting correctly please? Thank you. Where is pedometer at?"
"Infinite load screen, never able to use the app. Only solutions online point to downloading an apk of older versions. Suggestions from support below is to clear cache. Despite this being a clean install, I tried that anyways and it did not resolve the issue. I don't have time to waste with sitting on hold with customer service."
"Worst experience from samsung, no propee sleep tracking timings, I cannot check my heart rate I cannot track my sleeping and waking time as wellk"
"Overall good, nicely working with Galaxy Watch 5 pro on non Samsung phone, well working integration with Google Fit. What I don't like is how heart rate data is presented - those min-max bars is not what I'd expect. I wish it had more exercises or ability to create my own so I could distinguish power pump training from full body workout and trampoline trainings."
I love this app. It is easy to use and I can get my results quickly. Please put the Oxygen saturation alone back. I liked it this way better than having to check level my stress level to get my result. And the result is logged for that time. It needs to be able to keep track of oxygen levels too like over a week. Please change it back. Thank you.
"I like the band and the app well enough, but if I don't reach my step target for a particular day, those steps don't show up at all. With the current software, steps only show on the app if you have reached your daily step goal. Also the last weekly update available on the app seems to May 10-May 16, 2020. I would also like to see the weekly updates shown as progress bars for each day, rather than a line for a whole week."
"This is a great app, but I have 2 issues. I bought a Samsung. It's such a great phone I love it. But I can't sync my workout data with google fit from samsung health. Why not? Be compatible with stuff not independent. And secondly I found a work around to sync data from samsung health to google fit, it's an app called health sync. then I found out that it's being fixed to where you can't do this by Samsung. Like why be compatible with google fit please. I'll definitely be calling you guys"
"Blood Oxygen Saturation NOT reliable. ive always used the function on my S8 with normal results. on the S10+ my oxygen level is all over the place. i will take the measurement simultaneously on the S8 and S10+ with huge variances. i was so worried i had a health issue, turns out its the S10+ and my bloos saturation is normal. I really want to use this feature and im very disappointed."
"this is the only fitness app ive found that lets you easily track food, exercise, and sleep all in one app. it has programs to follow, advice, and different kinds of trackers. being free is always a huge factor for me too so i love that i dont have to sift through ads and stuff just to be told that i have to pay for premium. cant get enough of this app. im obsessed."
"I am getting a ""Can't open app"" error. I have cleared cache and data, installed from play store as well as the galaxy store, verified permissions, cleared all settings on the phone, and factory reset the phone with and without recovering from backup all with no success. This is on the Samsung s20 ultra 5g with a Galax watch 4 classic. Unfortunately without the app it renders a lot of smartwatch features useless and might be getting returned because of this."
"I had to uninstall today due to the update. It will not open, keeps saying it will not open due to a rooted phone?? I closed out the program and every few seconds it would pop up AFTER the program had been closed completely with the same error message ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I had to come to the play store to find the app and uninstall it that way! I had this happened bc I loved using this app!"
"Don't use the app. You can't sign into your health app as you must click the promo message notifications and you can't continue as you need to do the verification toe protect your data, which is fine but the verification codes does not work. I've typed, copied the code and it will not allow the verify button to become active to continue. Previously when I used it had no issues."
The app was working fine on my new A50 phone for 3 days. When I tracked my walk through Exercise it automatically updated the Steps count aftr the walk. Now this does not happen. When I view the walking log the previous walk results have (Auto) after them. The days since then do not have this and that is when the results started not to sync.
"Using on a Galaxy Watch. After latest update: Skips one or two seconds ahead, a few times a minute (on a 5k run you get a time worse by 1-2 minutes) Doesn't seem to track distance correctly anymore (sometimes captures 10m, sometimes 100m at a time). Increasing GPS sensitivity doesn't help. Overall the same route I always take is shorter by about 0.5 k No Guided announcements for running anymore All worked fine prior to the update"
"it's a really cool and helpful app but I think it should have a setting where you can set which things you want it to give you notifications/reminders. for example, I tend to fall short of how much water I should drink. it would be cool if I could have the app remind me to drink water."
"After the latest update, now stuck in a loop of continuously receiving a ""cant open app"" message. Letting me know app is unable to open on a rooted phone. My phone is not rooted. serious irritating issue. Going to uninstall if it doesn't get corrected in the next couple of days. Really loved the app prior to this issue."
"Doesn't measure sleep anymore either. Bring back the old weight features. Low/average/high weight for day, month and year. That was a unique feature. It's great to know you're average monthly/weekly weight loss, you usually don't loose a pound/kilo a day, so you're daily weight doesn't really matter. It's the weekly/monthly averages that support a trend."
was finding it really good and accurate compared to hospital to measure my oxygen saturation levels but that part seems to have disappeared from the programmes. my review will change when o2 levels come back as its own feature as reading it under stress levels is not useful as heart rate increases when oxygen is low which then increases what it says as your stress levels.
"- Watch just reset - lost data. - App updated. Forced me to link my contacts to log in. I have work contacts that were automatically added. Very unprofessional. - 2 step verification is stupid. It's a fitness app not a safe in a bank vault. If I REALLY cared about data security, I'd secure ALL accounts on ALL devices & definitely NOT give permission to access contacts. - App doesn't sync to other apps properly. - Calorie burn tracking is inaccurate. - Food log is terrible. Useless database."
"Stress level future doesn't work. the error message said: this phone can't measure your stress level, but you ca sync data from your Samsung account with this tracker. my girlfriend and I are both bought new phones and both can t use this option. I was able use it on my old Galaxy S8. I think there no common sense downgrade this app on better models?"
"It's okay. It doesn't have a Disc Golf feature or anyway of being compatible with any of the disc golf apps, the main sport I play besides hiking. Nobody's thought of doing anything with it in that regards so, other wise it does well tracking heart rate, steps, walking distances, floors and the like."
"Use to be ok but recently it was updated and won't work without giving calls permission and I don't allow physical activity permission as I use a fit band, Google fit counts my phone movements for Pok√©mon go. But I get this constant unremovable notification begging for the permission. Plus it deleted all my past data. Not sure why I bother. The app is paused now Edit: looks like I got a bot copy paste response, only picked up on the first 2 lines but everything else is ignored"
One of the best fitness apps out there if you use an Android device (version for iOS was watered down). Lots of useful insights for the casual to the hard core fitness enthusiasts. Only gripe is it does not connect with runkeeper and pulling in data from a smart scale has been challenging.
"Great app!! It really makes it easy to track important health indicators. Easy to use and accurate info. The only downside is the calorie counter. It would be very helpful to have a barcode reader and ""oz"" option. This would make logging meals much easier and faster."
"Really good, global competitions. It was really hard for me to lose weight but with all the competitions i just wanted to get higher ranking and ended up being more active which resulted in weight loss. Also it helps you keep track of your calorie intake. Really recommend this app."
"Does NOT work with Pixel 2XL after update. Google did an update, the app stopped working.Then Samsung finally did their update, but the app still does not work. It will not track my steps, what was once a good app now is useless UPDATE: The fixes don't work. Stopping and starting the pedometer makes the app count for about a few hours,maybe. Clearing the cache and force stopping the app doesn't work either. Goodbye, it was a good app."
"I used to be able to use this app with no problem. It worked with my watch and I really enjoyed logging different things on it. For some reason now all it says is that it cannot be opened on a rooted phone and I have done nothing different to my phone. I don't know the cause of the problem. ive uninstalled and reinstalled. No fix. I've enven turn off my wallpaper theme, and still no fix. i don't know whats changed hut it will no longer work on my Samsug Galaxy S8."
"In Samsung health Food it was Perfect before, I could add foods and their nutritional value. Now, with the update, I cannot unless I did before the update. If they have your item, you have to choose from their list and the nutritional value I've chosen for 2 items already has been incorrect. I just want the old food before the update that made it all 5x more difficult and much worse for the food section."
"Samsung responded quickly and well to my problems. Apparently their software wasn't at fault, but the firmware update was the problem. Mostly fixed with the new firmware update. OLD REVIEW Loved this app, until recent updates. No longer prompts to move, instead decides you're sleeping. Can change time to when you are sleeping, wipes out the stages of sleep- used to keep stages. Garmin can do it, now you can't?"
"UPDATE 1: I was able to install the app by downloading an older version of the app, then signing in and updating to the newer version once signed in into the older app version. Update 2: The watch gear S3 app does NOT allow to edit the list of workouts. Great workouts options are available on the phone app but can't be sync/transferred with the watch health app. Please push a Samsung gear health app updates for the S3 frontier watch. The last update was on 01/2020."
I have been using this app since back to my days with an S3 and currently S20 and it has never disappointed me till just recently the voice prompts have become sporadic and very frustrating. I have removed and reinstalled the app and the same thing keeps happening. I get some of the prompts and the next day I get others. I hope that that sometime in the near future the people who review these will let the proper person know of the issue. It is happening on both mine and my wife's.
"Every update this app gets progressively worse. First you got rid of the ability to track calories used vs taken in. Now I can't see weight over the month just per day. I used to love all the data I got and how easy it was too track exercise and food. I'm seriously considering going back to myfitnesspal. Also, the new font is awful."
"Switched from a fitbit to samsung active 2, and want to address some items: 1. There's no cardio fitness score, though watch has same and more features as fitbit. It's currently only available for the active 3 üòí 2. Watch faces have VERY small display no.s for steps, heart rate, etc. Also...no watchface gives steps, stairs, hr, date, and weather all together. 3. Equally not cool is the fact that the app doesn't register stairs climbed when I mtn.bike uphill! Clearly my hr would show that."
"1. could have introduced a daily readiness score based on the activities and sleep , steps, intensity etc for each day so that users will get motivated to beat yesterday's score 2. Could have a better app interface which highlights activities, step count, heart beat, etc instead of scrolling down 3. Could have used more graphical representation of previous activities and steps of past months and days 4. Achievements are not updating properly Overall the app is good, has good potential"
"I've given this app 3 chances. I even had my watch (Galaxy Active 2) switched out because I thought it was faulty. Nope. It's the app. It over-counts steps by thousands. This is the one Samsung thing that has been highly disappointing. I'm glad my watch works fine once I unistall the app, but I lose so many features. I truly hope one day we get an app that does all this technology justice."
"App no longer works properly w/Samsung Fit tracker. When I log a workout on my tracker, that workout will not sync until the following day. In the past this data used to update in real time while my tracker was connected to my phone. This is very frustrating. The only reason I purchased a Samsung Fit was because it was supposed to seamlessly connect and share data with my Samsung phone via the Samsung Health app."
"Since the latest updated forces you to allow access to your phone and contacts and it has zero reasons for that, I'm not gonna use this app anymore. I don't care that Samsung swears that they won't share my data with anyone - I ain't going to allow this kind of access in order to use my simple fit e band with b/w display just because their programmers can't figure out how the app could work without it. If I wanted a fancy band that can make calls, I would have gotten one."
Was a great app until the latest phone update. Now it keeps saying I've made unauthorized changes to my phone and refuses to open. Uninstalled the app and then reinstalled and got the same warning. Cleared cache and data and still get the same error. *edit* thank you for giving me a number where the tech cannot actually help me with the Samsung health app. To make it an even more pointless endeavor the tech could not provide me with the correct number. *slow clap*
"Changed my five stars to four, simply because since the latest update a few days ago the widget has turned to a hideous white and looks horrible on my screen. Please bring back the opaque dark option ‚ô° - Bought a new phone and accidentally came across the option that changes this by long pressing on the widget and being able to change it from white to black under a settings menu. Leaving it at four due to lack of response from app makers and their ability to answer this for me :P Otherwise an awesome app and I love the monthly step challenges <3"
"This was my favorite Health app, but not anymore. I recently switched to a new device, and I the data from my previous device can't be synced with my new device, I have tried any possible options, nothing works. I wrote to Samsung support many times, they answer like a robot, and they guide me through the possible options that must work but don't. At the end they ask me to call to customer service. I guess this happens because my older device is using old version of Health..."
"Only have this bc of my Galaxy Watch. The app is killing my phone battery even though I only open it every few days. Told it not to run in the background but it does anyway. And often running in general even though it's not supposed to be tracking steps etc. Revoked permissions didn't help. I'm tired of seeing it at the top of my battery usage. Have to keep forcing the app to quit, checking every few hours. The app itself is okay. Far too many requested permissions."
"It's a good app, but I haven't been able to log in for almost a week now. I tried everything (clearing cache, app data, uninstalling and reinstalling, disabling other apps I thought my somehow conflict with it) and nothing seems to work. I'm very disappointed at the moment."
"This app has never worked since I bought the phone brand new from AT&T. It pops up that my phone was either ""rooted"" or there were ""unauthorized changes"". I have never rooted by phone(I had to google it to even know what that meant.). I even downloaded an app to detect if it was rooted and it says it wasn't. I have tried redownloading, clearing memory, and other suggestions I've seen online when I researched how to fix it. Nothing has worked. Thankfully, I can use my Fitbit to get similar info."
"I was using the app for than a year already, then I found it slow and I decided that I have not updated the app. After updating it, there was a bug when I click sync now it keeps on spinning forever, I uninstall and restarted my phone is still not working. Hope you can find out about this issue."
"I use this app daily. I love it. It's really useful for me to track my food and exercise. The only thing is I would suggest Samsung to add a bar code scanner for the food log. Sometimes I cant find the food I ate when I type it or it's not accurate in the nutrition label. Also, Samsung should add popular gym class work outs like Zumba. I do a lot of Zumba but I can only record it as dance, which isnt really accurate or my watch will auto detect it to running. Otherwise great app."
"Great pedometer if you have your phone or synced device with you. Showing activity trends help me stay active, texts after reaching step goals are great motivators. Sleep tracker works shortly after opening the app, doesn't appear daily and stops after a few missed entries. If there's an option to be bugged daily for correct health diagnostic, I'd do it even if a little annoying."
"I dont like that once I save something I can't change it. it assumes I wake up whenever I use my phone for the first time, but that's not always the case. I need to be able to adjust my sleep time to reflect when I actually slept even if I already saved it. also a tracker for cigarettes/nicotine would be awesome for people who are trying to cut down or quit smoking altogether. thanks!"
Does not stay connected and i don't need foriengers keeping track of my health for their evil agenda. Not to mention everytime you update the app the watch use is not as valuable as it was when i first got it for instance i cant listen to my music anymore. I am thinking of going back to my antolog watch. Thus foriegner garb is good for absolutly nothing especially fi ti si ton gnikrow.
"Have been using this app combined with my Samsung galaxy fit. I have had a couple issues with the updating the step count, it doesn't always update the correct amount of steps from the fitness watch to this app some days it's only 20-50 steps out of sync other days it's been 200-400 steps out. This is my only issue everything else is easy to use I enjoy being able to watch how my fitness is coming along and being able to compete with family and friends as well as the Samsung fitness community."
Over the last few months my steps have not been counting on an increasingly daily basis. I've had this app for at least 3 years and it was working fine until a few months ago. I've tried every possible workaround to 'fix' this issue but it's so unreliable now that I think it's time to delete the app.
"Each update of this app seems to make it worse, I used to be be able to get blood oxygen levels with the Sensor on my SAMSUNG phone (which is just for that) now the HW is useless because they removed the feature and can't even enter the data manually. Now since the last update it doest detect my polar HR sensor which is really frustrating. Feature request: I want to be able to query MY data easily so that I can track it in a spreadsheet. enter mood, alcohol, and custom things. Calculate HR recup"
The new update is absolutely horrible. The interface looks like it's from the 90s all of a sudden and you can't change the view of your exercise history to day view? I mean this is what I got having had the new version open for all of a couple of minutes... if someone under the age of 50 created this new design I'd be shocked.
"Been using this app since 2015, never had an issue until 2 days ago. Once the update for the ECG reader was completed, the watch will not record heart rate, steps, sleep, stress etc. Watch says it's unable to sync try again. I've reset the watch and phone, both have the latest software updates (I have the newest devices: galaxy S20plus/watch 3)"
"I hate hate hate this latest update. Words can't describe how much I loathe this update. Now I have to add up the grams of carbs, fats, and protein consumed over three meals and snacks, where it used to be the app would have a running total of macros in grams in one spot. Now, I can't compare my average weight week over week. If the app won't track this stuff for me, I might as well use a notebook, pencil, and calculator. This app update is most inconvenient."
"Audio Coaching Locked The audio coach during workouts that tell you milestones on your workout is now turned off. Under Audio Guide, this is no longer an option to turn on. This was a great feature during a workout. I really wish this could be turned back on."
"Have been using this app for a long time, very useful while training and stuff but after getting my phone updated fully, I can not change the voice of audio guide (googled and searched all settings) and the default one has really awful sound. Would be really happy if you could help with this issue."
"They are collecting way to much info. Why would I ever wish to compete with a friend or anyone by sharing my personal info. Requiring access to everything is not necessary. I have deleted this program. I do not have the watch, nor do I plan to get one. I was simply tracking a few areas. It was fine before the update ."
Was satisfied with the app until yesterday. The screen appears when I open app want me to agree with terms and conditions. No options offered. You agree or can't go further. App want to access to my other personal information which has no relation with health. including camera and location. Don't let me delete or disable the app even. if they keep doing this then done with Samsung's products. Unless they fix.
"Not compatible with Duck Duck Go browser, so I cannot even sign in to create a Samsung account."
"I love this app, my only problem is logging food. I actually used my fitness pal because they let you scan barcodes for nutritional info. Also samsung doesn't have all food in there anyway, so it's impossible to track it manually. Other than that it is very useful in keeping track of your weight."
"I have had a galaxy watch for a month now and I loved this app. I even lost 10 lbs. But for the last few days, and a couple of random ones before that, my calorie burned in a short amount of time is insanely high. And my workouts now have 0 calories burned. I've called twice about it and it hasn't helped. And after trying to find something on google about it I see it has been a problem since July? Needless to say I'm pissed off about it."
"It's good. I like the vital sign monitoring and the step counter. I also think it's easy to use and a great way to monitor progress. BUT, when are you going to add a patch so I can see my current steps on my lock screen? I hate having to go in my phone, launch the app, wait for it to load up, and then get my current steps progress. I should be able to check it on my lock screen real quick and keep going. Btw, I'm not getting a fitness watch that I can't wear at work. No degloving, thanks."
Why Change It? I liked the app the way it was. You took away a useful tool when you got rid of the weight management scale. It was useful because it let you know how many calories you burned in your workout and throughout the day vs the calories you were taking in throughout the day. It told you if you needed to eat or workout. It told you when you were good by staying in the green zone. I'm going to look for something else now. Thanks for Nothing.
"The app is good. It's has the basics sleep, food, steps, water, etc. But the problem is that the app is a little to basic. I would like to see stuff like on mental wellbeing. For example you could add a ""how was your day"" in the app and than surveying our day and giving us feedback and showing improvement. And add stuff for personal things like habit formation and giving us a streak for everytime we do our habit. It would just be nice to see things other than the basic health things."
"There is no ability to connect to an external heart rate monitor. There are missing metrics from half the sports like a distance setting for cross country skiing. This app is a total joke. Probably great if you care about pointless metrics like counting steps. I've got plenty of Samsung products and ultimately I think it's time to switch. All of their products suck. Even my Note 20 Ultra 5G, their literal flagship phone's camera stopped working and after they ""fixed"" it, they refused to again"
Error with Note 8 When I first got the phone the app worked fine. I got the samsung active watch and a month later the app said it's not supported on rooted phone. My phone is not rooted and never have been. Suddenly it was working again for two weeks. Now its back to same message. I wish another app supported this watch. This app is garbage.
"Good for tracking your vitals, especially when you feel a bit off. GPS tracking needs work. It doesn't track all trips. A check temperature feature would be also great. And more third party fitness trackers should be allowed to work with it instead of these expensive ones that do."
"New update removed features I used.. in the Food section there used to be an option to add up to six meals, three mains and three snacks. Now I'm forced to use three meals and log my snacks separately out of chronological order? Adding a nice lemon animation wasn't worth the features removed. Fix this! App is now useless to me. Time to shop around."
Uninstalled since new permissions. Now can't use with my Galaxy watch. Will be moving to Garmin when I can afford it. Re your reply: I am fine with the biometrics as it is for the purpose of health. I do not want to share contacts and other info for features I do not want to use. It would be far better to make the feature that requires that optional e.g. to connect with friend allow access to contacts. In order for app to do this you would have to hold the contact information in your database in order to process matching. I don't want that. When you have multi-layered permissions I will reconsider.
It was going great for the past 2 years since I started this until now. I didn't know there was an update but it was not a big deal. It was frustrating is to know that for some odd reason I can't manually add my workout. I forgot to turn on my workout mode on my Fitpro 2. It didn't automatically registered that I did 30 minutes of cardio/core workout and I've been spending a good 20 minutes to input it but can't. What's going on?
"I'm a long-time user of this app. It has being very helpful in counting my calories and my calorie loss through workouts. I can honestly say that it has helped me to lose weight due to my ability to track my steps and calorie intake. However this new update makes me very unhappy. It no longer shows with a clear icon if my calorie count is under, good, or over and no longer takes into account my workouts with my calorie intake. Very disappointing update. I don't care about inviting my friends!!!"
"The app is great. It keeps you motivated by completing different challenges. You can keep track of lots of things like water intake, walking routines. It would very nice to have some team challenges because it would make the app even more interesting."
Garbage browser logins and endless 2fa prompts. Just a nightmare expierience
Records driving as walking so it gives inaccurate results
"Okish- when it works. Every time I do an update, there's always issues with it accurately recording my steps. Today I have been walking for 5 minutes so far- and no steps are recorded. Very disappointing and frustrating, as it worked brilliantly when I first bought the phone in February."
"October update - Samsung finally removed the huge ad. Updated to 5 stars. September update - still has ads taking up top third of home page! The most annoying thing about this app is when you open it and the top third of the screen has a giant ad, usually for samsung products. Remove the ads or let us disable them and I'll change the rating. Dev response is amusing. Solution is to remove the ads not call support. SMH. Clearly Samsung doesn't listen"
"Overall its a good app. I had a few sleeples nights over the integration services with myfitnesspal (food tracking) and endomondo(sports tracking),it is finally syncing like I wanted. Needs some polishing on the workout layout and displaying sports statistics overall is unclear and less useful so I still have to use endomondo on that part."
"Glitchy. It records me sleeping when I am not. When I go to manually record my sleeping time, it will not let me save the correct data. If the health data is not accurate, what's the point? Update: After review, looks like they got into my app and changed something. Now it doesn't auto record at all AND I can't record manually. Removing original 3 stars."
I use this app on a daily basis. I also have the app for my watch. My question is HOW do I open the app on my laptop so I can get in a workout while at home on my laptop instead of on my phone? THANKS for the replies!
"Great app and useful one stop shop for most things I need to track. My only major issue is that you can only enter food on dates up to the present day. I try to plan by entering all of my food ahead of time so I know what lunch and snacks to pack to hit my macros. Not being able to plan untill I wake up is annoying. Planning ahead would also help with shopping for the week. Please consider updating, I really like this app and want it to continue being my go to for all things health tracking"
"This health app very good, walking, running, cycling all can use. ** Don't know why now no more cycling app ready, after no more cycling app I stop using this app ready"
"Alright I guess. Nothing special. The app mistakes riding my motorcycle for walking (somehow). I went for a walk recently and rather than just being able to hit 'start walk' so I could record the exercise I was prompted to enter a goal distance. That's so silly. I didn't know how long the walk would be, just let me walk and record the data. Instead I had to just walk and let the app 'detect' walking and hope that it recorded my walk accurately. It didn't."
A lot of info on this app. I still wish it was easier to add friends and communicate. More social that it's been since they removed the Community features though. My only real complaint is that I'm apparently unable to update my steps in the app unless a wearable device is connected. So if my watch battery dies it would seem I get a big middle finger until I can connect it again.
"Great app to keep track of your health and fitness. Keeps records, which are compiled in an easy to understand manner. Has several subdivisions for different aspects of your health. Heart rate and stress monitoring systems are great. Does not irritate with unnecessary notifications."
new bug in the update! I just updated my Samsung health app and now it keeps auto-launching and saying that the app cant launch on a rooted phone. My phone isn't even rooted! And I'm not even trying to launch it either. I'm deleting the app until the bug is fixed because the auto launching keeps interrupting whatever else I'm doing. Its tried to launch 9 or 10 times since I started writing this
"So the latest update doesn't add, but removes features. Namely weight management which was very useful. I was thinking about upgrading my watch to the galaxy watch 3, but I guess I will be switching to Fitbit if this doesn't get fixed. EDIT: the new color scheme is just idiotic. Don't you think there are people with vision problems out there? Using 3 shades of green, seriously? The new sleep score is also completely useless, the sleep efficiency made sense. Bring back weight management!!!!!"
"I think this app is pretty good, but unless I'm just not seeing it, the latest update has removed the ability for me to cycle through all of my old exercises from specific exercise types. For example, I used to be able to see all of my different runs, but I can't anymore. Now all I can see is my last 30 days of workouts. This isn't an improvement."
"The app is good, auto detection works well. Need one more important setting - when it detects work out then there should be alerts of speed, distance, avg speed, calories burnt, etc every 1, 2, 3 minutes frequency set by user. Since this feature is not there I have to use another app like Adidas Running or Noom coach. This feature would be very useful for workouts"
"I would have rated it 5, but with the latest updates, I'd like to give it a minus 5....... I'm seriously about to go to the dark side and change everything to apple!!!!! Not being able to see data in blocks of weeks/months has made this app useless. And now with the latest update I can't edit my sleep records. WHY??? if the app worked properly this may not be much of an issue, but when it shows I was awake for an hour at the end of my sleep, it puts all my data out."
"Love it! I just wish you could see real life progress from friends (steps, active calories burned, etc). That would be great and adds a little more of a friendly competitive edge when doing co-op competitions. I would also like to be able to add more friends on the global challenges"
I was so excited about the redesign but after the upgrade I was disappointed. The previous version included nutritional information about almost all Indian dishes. This one doesn't. So every time I have to search and add food items to my list and that's really time consuming.
"Step/stride can't be adjusted, so step count may be accurate, but diatance isn't. Can't manually reset it. Sometimes it's nice to have that option when wanting to measure a specific route. If these changes are made, I would use the app again. Probably not until then."
"This is useless to me now. I used it extensively for heart rate, stress and O2 tracking. I no longer have the option for any of them. Just because you can change something does not mean you should. Not everyone can afford your add on equipment so you should really out this back on the app. Update - the features were removed and I cannot afford to purchase other devices to track what WAS included in this app until you removed the features. A $1.00 pedometer can do what this app does now."
"Trying to sync my watch data to my phone/computer and the app won't even login on my phone. I got an email immediately notifying me that I had a sign in from a new device, so the login was ""successful"" but the phone still won't log in. It just spins as the loading screen indefinitely until the phone goes to sleep. Literally unusable."
"I do like Samsung health, it's easy to use and works well, however it also still falls short where others do not. Such as only being able to count food intake as calories..not everyone trying to manage their weight does so by counting calories, I'd like to be able to use Marcos in the app, and weight that is only in kg and lbs, I never understood why there was no stone and lbs haha plenty of people use st. I just like this app, so it can be a little frustrating and time consuming sometimes."
"Was great until they demanded phone permissions. My steps and distance walked. All I care about. Not the account, not the health tracking. I don't care about the together feature. No more oversharing in the ID theft age. (Also Samsung, curved screens make it impossible to click X's on the curved part when you have giant hands)"
"Same problem as lots of other users: app was working fine until the latest update, as of this morning. Now all of the permissions for 3rd party apps (like MyFitnessPal) have changed and they no longer sync meals etc. with Samsung Health. This is a bit of a stitch up, to be honest, and I'm not stoked, as it's now made my Galaxy Watch kind of redundant for calorie tracking. I hope Samsung restores the previous permissions, bc this is pretty bad..."
"Guys, I just bought galaxy watch and it's all good, a lot of exercises which is awesome, but you can't customize them! Sets are set to 10 and laps to 3 with 1 minute rest in between, which is kinda disappointing, you should be able to customize this on your phone before training session and please add weights in bench press, curls and weight training. Thank you."
Since the last update the step count is so off... I'm standing still and it jumps to 800 steps. Useless now.
Have been using Shealth for many years and has always been a 4 or 5 ‚≠ê app for me. Recently changed to a non phone but still continue with Shealth. Unfortunately it now autopauses even when I am running and does not resume. Is it because I am using this app on a non Samsung phone? Or a bug? I do know I can choose to off the autopause option but would rather hv it on like how it has always been for many years. Almost unuseble now with the frequent autopause even when running.
"I found this app very useful but the latest update has destroyed it. There are now dozens of review comments that say allowing access to contacts and making phone calls is definitely a no-go. (And rightly so) Please remove this requirement. Saying it's only a formality and 'assuring' it won't be used isn't good enough, sorry. Also please fix the problems we are having with opening the app and accessing our own recorded progress. Thank you."
Overall I like it to track my steps. The only thing that really bothers me is the alerts it sends for the walking challenge. It will send 10 right in a row to check my progress. It continues to send them even if I check it. Very annoying.
"At times frustrating that searched food items frequently yield limited results. This scenario facilitates inaccurate documentation. Would be much better if there was a way to look up specific items in some other information system, then add that specific food/ calorie count to the daily total."
"Annoying changes. Whenever I enter time sleep time like from 22:30 to 06:30, it changes this time on confirmation to 21:30 and 05:30. It's like what the heck is going on. Undo that change. Goals are useless to setup since one week you work on call, another week you set back to normal, and then 3rd week to work from home. Regarding phones, make sure that all new Samsung phones that you make have all sensors to measure heart beat, oxygen in blood, and stress levels if not more."
"Great for tracking walks with GearFit2. Terrible at tracking distance and calories burned on cycling. when Galaxy 8+ goes to sleep, cycling no longer tracks distance. This is not an issue on walking. If I continually wake the phone up, the tracking improves. Cycling lacks a DO NOT SLEEP mode while engaged. The only way to prevent the phone from going to sleep is to kill for all apps. Even making sure Eclipsim GPS Status does not sleep doesn't prevent Galaxy from sleeping."
"The new update is terrible. I'm no longer able to easily see my macronutrients. Previously, it would easily show the number of grams of protein, carbs, and fats for the day so I could plan my meals accordingly. The new update simply shows a bar graph with no numbers, which defeats the purpose. Please revert back to how it was previously before this new update. Or at least include that feature where it's easy to see your daily macros. Please update the Nutrient Intake Summary ASAP"
"Update to below: Samsung Customer Service responded and had me do the 2-step thing on the web, rather than through the app. Clunky and shouldn't be necessary, but it worked. ............................................................. Doesn't work. 2-step verification BS fails every time. I enter the code sent to my phone but can't push ""Verify"". Button inactive. Samsung: thanks for your suggestion that I contact the app's support function. Which app do you mean? The one I can't even get into?"
"It's got everything. Especially after pairing it with Samsumg smart watch, it tracks activities well. One can set the goals and it tracks against it. Some improvements can make it 6 star! On food, fairly good list of menus but mostly UK based store. May be they could import most common lists from other geographies. A list of pre defined exercise plans which can progressively increase the challenges can help. Can't update sleep log once captured from the watch."
"Brilliant layout, but when you move from one device to the next, you don't always have enough cash to use your other devices with the app. So now my huawei band 4 does not work with this... It sort of defeats the purpose of owning a perfectly good device if you can't use it across all apps. Please consider universal device usage. When my device eventually dies, then I will buy a new one matching Samsung."
"It misses the mark on so many levels. Not very interactive or user friendly. It also doesn't share data with any other sources which is crazy. I will be turning in my Samsung fitness products and going back to fitbit. I've been using this as my step counter, sleep monitor, and fitness tracker with my galaxy watch."
"I basically keep track of my steps and active time. The food tracker has changed and is not as convenient to use. I used to be able to save particular meals and simply add them, but that feature doesn't seem to exist. Otherwise, I'm satisfied."
"The latest update appears to have removed the option to edit specific tracked sleep and wake times. Now if your Galaxy Watch tracks sleep or wake times incorrectly you'd have to delete the entire entry and manually replace it with generic data, whereas before you could easily adjust either the sleep or wake time without losing any useful data."
"Overall the app is OK however compared to other health apps I have been testing, this one does not count the steps properly or at all. I walk an average of 12 000 steps a day. At the end of the day, this app shows about 2000 to 4000 less steps. It does not count steps if the phone is either in my pocket or in my bag. And to keep it in my hands continously it's not doable."
"From the best app it became a nightmare!! All of the sudden the weekly, monthly and yearly data disappeared!!! I can't even track monthly cycle because the calendar is also gone from every single feature. Please fix this issue, we need the calendar back."
"Edit after response: as I said the app worked great even without the permissions. And now we can't use the app if we don't allow the permission. ... Was a great app til you started requesting phone call permission. There was absolutely no need for that, all features worked just wonderful without that permission for the last 5 years I am on a journey with Samsung. It's incredible how you guys are succeeding in turning people away not only from your apps but from your brand, too."
"Love using this on my galaxy S7. Pedometer and the challenges help push me to walk more. Pedometer is pretty accurate as I've verified the distance walked by measuring on Google maps afterwards. The only downside is the cheaters on the monthly walking challenges, the leader board is all filled with cheats. Not that it matters as they're only CHEATING THEMSELVES!"
"App now wants permission to make phone calls? I don't think so. Uninstalled. There's a response below to the same feedback saying it's needed for the ""together feature"". No idea what that is, but whatever it is, don't want it if it needs that kind of permission. Why not just allow that feature to be disabled so we can still use the app? And the response below does NOT justify the permission Samsung. You need to listen to your customers not come up with some rubbish standard response!"
"Does a good job of tracking your steps, has lots of features that you can manually adjust (food, water and caffeine intake) as well as a somewhat accurate sleep tracking but the biggest issue with this app is the fact that it turns off so often, and when it turns off your steps aren't tracked obviously"
"Sleep tracking is nice, although notifications don't actually go to the night of sleep that is being tracked. It shows you the previous night and you have to leave the page to find the night of sleep you want to track. I find it frustrating when notifications don't actually lead you to what they are notifying."
"Since the most recent update installed 5 Oct 2022, the clock for recording sleep defaults to one hour earlier when I manually input my data. Tried to edit/correct/delete/re-input multiple times without success. We're still in Pacific Daylight Savings Time not Standard Time. Will the clock ""fall back"" come November?"
"Great app for tracking steps, nutrition etc and love how it encourages friendly competition between users. Would be great if there was an option to auto enroll in to the community challenge each month, or at least include the data for the whole month if you join after the 1st, as I've lost out on steps progress sometimes!"
"I like the many options to follow multiple things, like water, sleep, heart rate... But there is one thing I'd like if possible. The sleep calculator doesn't have option to imput multiple sleep time. As if we all sleep through the night in one go... No naps either... with children it will be a while. I'd like to keep track of how much I've slept even if for short periods."
"I really like a lot this app and it's been helpfulit helps me keeping up with my workout, sleeping time, what I eat even to meditate with the mindful area...but lately it's not being counting my steps, it's kind of freezes, and stopped working on my phone I had to uninstall it and install It again. It works for a while but then it started to have glitches again. Please fix this."
"Love the app, it helps keep me motivated to keep moving. Only issue is the captured distance is off by about a third of a mile. The distance I'm tracking and what it has are just not matching. But other than that, I love it. It would had been a 5 star."
"I used to love this app because of the heart rate and blood oxygen monitoring feature, especially with covid. This past update removed the use of the sensor on my S10. I don't see how they can sell a product based on certain features and then decomission them within 3 years. This does not make me want to buy a new Samsung phone, quite the opposite. So fix it."
I use to have a lot of issues with this app before when i had a note 8 despite the issues i liked it and continued to use it. After nearly 3 years i finally get a phone to use it again and i cant use it without allowing access to phone or setting up 2 factor authentication. Guess what samsung i dont want either of these options so after being super excited to use the app i was let down and uninstalled it..
Horrible that the app does not properly support newer SAMSUNG watches like the Galaxy Watch. It DOUBLE COUNTS the steps from both the phone and watch. There is no way to track just your watch. Or have it stop automatically counting steps from the phone when the watch is connected. Help articles specifically say that certain SAMSUNG watches are not supported. Seriously? No wonder people like Apple. Their products just work the way they should.
"I don't so much hate this APP as I do the fact that Samsung almost forces you to use this app if you have a Samsung watch. I have been using Strava for years and have no desire to change, but Samsung refuses to work well with Strava. There are tons of posts of people, like me, struggling to get valid Samsung watch data to Strava without being forced to use Samsung health or manually export the data. Just about makes me want to switch back to Garmen or Fitbit."
"it doesn't really work for tracking runs. It wont track my location properly so I have no idea how far I ran. Sometimes it will pause itself randomly in the middle of a workout. I gave it 2 stars because the widget is nice for tracking steps throughout the day, but that's it."
When I go for a 2 mile walk I use this app and Google Fit. Google Fit is way more accurate in tracking the 2 miles.
"No longer works POS after receiving a message for my 1 star rating they asking me to contact support I changed it to a 5. Reason being, they cared enough to reach out why I gave them a one-star. Also the phone I switch to the Samsung S21 Ultra has so many cameras on it there's no way or no room to do the heart rate. This makes total sense and I love this phone. I have been using Samsung including tablets for quite some time and I'm extremely pleased with Samsung. The support was awesome! TY"
"Overall, the app is good however I am unable to view total miles (or km) anywhere. This should be a vital feature in any health app and is the reason for 3 stars. I take part in a yearly walking challenge and use my Samsung watch to track mileage. After a quick Google search, I am not the only user that this inconveniences - please get it fixed Samsung!!"
"This last update changed the app to stop counting steps and I'm furious after 11 straight months of using it. All of a sudden. It's specifically effecting the steps counted because it's still lapsing time correctly, but my steps have been cut in half. I've force stopped it, turned counting steps off and on, deleted and and then I redownload the app, I've cleared the cache. Nothing. And I can't undo the stupid update. Terrible. I'd give it zero stars. Currently looking for a new health app."
"Same experience as others. Downloaded this to pair with my watch...it won't let me past the login screen. It just stays loading forever. Have tried uninstalling, clearing the cache, googling the issue, etc. This is the main app I want to use on the watch and it is completely useless. May have to end up returning the watch since health tracking was one of the main reasons behind the purchase. Really bummed."
It no longer takes my pulse ox. Even in the stress management. It will not take my pulse ox. And then pairing it with my samsung smart watch. Its even less effective what ever changed with this app. Has made it not worth having. Time to find a better app. When I 1st got my phone. Everything worked great. Then the app changed. To bad.
Need to be able to edit sleep times as sometimes the wake up time is completely wrong. You can edit it only when creating a manual entry but then you lose all your other sleep tracking data. I came from a fitbit and you could do this. Disappointed I can't do that here... ***edit in response to review-- this isn't something they would be able to help with as this is a feature lacking from the app
"UPDATE: STILL NOT FIXED. Following the latest Samsung update, the Samsung Health app has issues. As others reported, the sensor to read heartrate and oxygen level stopped working. Once I uninstalled and reinstalled the app, the record buttons to measure stress and heartrate were simply gone. Also gone was all of my exercise data back to November 2019. I'm hoping that it will be restored when the app is repaired."
"It's been a great app, so far. One hiccup happened this evening, though. I went out for my regular 5km run. I ran for my longest period ever, nearly the whole 5km! But sadly, much to my disappointment, Samsung Health did not auto record my data! I don't know why. Everything was on and good to go. Step counter was supposedly on and working. So I have no clue. I was disappointed because I wanted to see my new results! I wanted to share. I wish it did record. It usually does. üò©"
"Easily the best health app on the market. Clean, clear UI and a ton of useful information with clear explanations.The running analysis is especially fantastic. Gold standard! -1 star however as the time and distance using Galaxy 4 is vastly different than running apps synced and gpx export. Note customer support was unable to resolve."
"Recent update froze my progress, nothing will load and I really miss keeping track. Hope the issue gets revolved soon, I noticed when my widget said ""updating"" for a long while now (and still going.) Definitely a five star app when working, can't wait to have it back to functioning standards. Edit: learned something new on how to clear the cache and it's functioning properly again! Took it a while but sooo glad this is a tool on my phone again! I recommend using this app to all my friends!"
Deleted and downloaded the newest version. Once again. GPS sucks. Won't detect your location and when it does reconnect it takes a straight line instead of actually following your route. Why would I keep Samsung if this is apart of my daily routine and daily these apps fail to do what they are built to do.
"The weight management on this app is terrible. Even when I eat under my target calories and manage at least 30 minutes of active time, it says I'm over my goal. It makes it very frustrating and somewhat discouraging for it to constantly tell me to eat lighter meals even when I already am. It seems the only way to make this thing happy is to eat under 1000 calories per day and never sit down."
"The weight tracker graph is no good. It is tiny and can't view a trend over time. The old graph was ok (but still could be improved on), the current graph is garbage. Bring back a weight tracking graph that is useful and can view on full screen to make it easier to view."
"Same as many others, i don't want to give access to me phone. I don't see how it can improve my experience. But even if i accept it says me season has expired and all me to log in my Samsung account and then closes. No way to log in, nothing. Can't access it anymore, great! Edit: finally managed to get in, but now if i want to enter a challenge i have to give all my contacts to Samsung otherwise no challenge. No respect at all for privacy"
I liked the health app until they took a feature off of the weight management where it shows you if your over or under your calories. And gives you an all over view of how much exercise you need to reach your goal. They replaced it with tracking your menstrual cycle. Now I've lost interest in the app.
"Continuing to ask for going to Setting and change permissions. Permissions are granted, not to turn on and off bluetooth, and still the app is not working. So, bye bye this rotten apple .. Seems that other people are having similar issues and the developer is doing nothing to remedy. All explanations are weird abs with good will could have recovered by the developer, who ever he is. Shame on Samsung on digging itself in the hole Again, bye. I'm uninstalling this app."
"Since it was updated, it requires permission to make and modify calls before I can open it. No thank you. Edit in response to the developer: Rather than implementing blanket permissions, you should only ask for specific permission when I try to use the feature that would require that access. I do not do anything in the app that would require giving access to my photos or for the app to make or modify my calls. This is massive over reach."
"This app is on the precipice of being one of the best apps ever. But is stifled entirely by Samsung's neglect of development. The features this app has are wonderful and nearly cutting edge. But once any new features are brought out they're left to die in a sea of neglect. The together features could be wonderful, but lack the engagement and social interaction you would get from something like apple. And the world tours were once super cool and engaging but going on year 4/5 of the same thing"
"This app used to be useful. Now it wouldn't open without what appeared to be giving it unlimited access. It's now uninstalled and I will avoid use of any Samsung apps. Samsung appears to want to discourage use of their apps if you don't give them access to everything. re: Samsung's response, I see no reason for granting all the access required. It's still uninstalled. It's frustrating the data has apparently been lost!"
Step tracking is somehow accurate. Sleep tracking is based on your entered sleep data and your screen time. I was very active with this app but this stared consuming my battery a lot. I didn't found this one to keep for everytime since it reopened whenever I tried to go back to the app. And the mindfulness section is linked with a third party app and we need subscription to access all those things. I don't think that's necessary to subscribe. Please add your own things so can I go back again.
"The reply below, doesn't address any of my issues. Obviously a cut and paste job. Also there is no 'support' fake email and phone number. Samsung... What are you doing? If you read any of the recent feedback and reviews, the people hate this recent update. I enjoyed this app at the beginning. However when Samsung changed it and added two step verification... Because I need to make sure no other person can log steps for me..!? I've decided not to use it anymore. The app wants to much access to my phone and that is a not happening. The app does not need access to make calls to track my weight loss. The silly Bixby implementation is still the most annoying addition and this means I'm probably going to switch to the Google Pixel as my next phone. After being a Galaxy user since the start you are slowly losing touch. You've lost a lot of customers and will continue to lose customers until you start listening to them. UPDATE: Then responded with the most cut & paste answer ever. This has confirmed I was right about Samsung. Goodbye to any further Samsung products and apps"
"I'm deleting this horrible App. It has a bug and does not consider if you complete a challenge first and waits for others to finish and declare them winners. I complete challenges with other friends days before they do and they still win. Wow, great way Samsung Health is counting steps. Looking for other programs already. Contacted their customer support at no avail. Don't waste your time and look for a good health tracker. I recommend the App Health Tracker. It works just fine - bye Samsung."
"I've enjoyed the app for a long time now. The features are great and the seamless integration with my watch is great. But I can only give you two stars now due to the giant slideshow at the top of the home screen. Basically a giant ad for your own products - GET RID OF IT and let us focus on our health, not your profits."
"Can't even open the app. Keeps telling me telling me to try again later... for days now. And I have a brand new Samsung phone, you'd think it would be compatible. I've removed and reinstalled a couple times, restarted my phone and still the same. Apparently the features I wanted have been removed anyways in the last update. Uninstalling and looking for something better."
"I was loving the app. I started using it just three days ago and it was helping me a lot with my weight loss, building my meals, following my exrcises goals. I was realy happy with it until today when the food settings stoped working. I think it's a bug and I hope they fix it soon."
The use the app all the time. My only change would be to add a barcode scanner when adding food. Trying to search through so many options is overwhelming and takes a while to find what your looking for. I use my fitness pal to track my food for ease of use.
"Before giving and stars above 1 just want to know - as you have noreply email - is truly possible you limit export of data to just THREE MONTHS? Have been using now for 3 years and just now guessing that maybe I did terrible mistake to trust your app. Addendum: Thanks for responding, but not sure why would customer have to call international support number (especially if weak in speaking in English), when question was very simple, how to export ALL data in Excel. Anyway, decided to dump app, already found better and reliable replacement."
"doesnt work. ""cant open on a rooted phone"". my phone is not, nor has it ever been rooted. (galaxy note9) they tell me to call samsung customer support. those guys go through very basic troubleshooting, then tepl me to reset the phone. done all of that and the app still doesnt work. it would be lovely if the app would just work. This is a known issue. You'd think an update would fix it. i have the latest update on both my phone and the app, Ive done alp the troubleshooting, and Ive called support"
I've used the app for years same as a lot of the recent reviews and now I cant access unless I allow access to manage my phone calls. This makes no sense as this app has nothing to do with calls! No way I'm ever going to use this app unless they remove this ridiculous permission! Also the response from Samsung which is clearly copied and pasted to each person doesn't explain anything. It doesn't explain why it needs to manage your phone calls or what this feature actually does.
"I like this app, encourages me to be better with the food I eat, a scanner for food nutrition would be good. I have the new Galaxy Active watch and they complement each other very well. I'd like to see the horse riding option on the watch as I can only activate it on my phone"
"Do you guys even care? Why does the bugs never get fixed on this app? This has to be the buggiest fitness app on playstore. I bought Samsung Fit 2 Pro, neither the band neither the app works properly. Both are always buggy. Randomly adding up the calories, random targets are set, even though i have set another target. It always gets changed. Do you guys plan to fix them?"
"This used to be a great app to track my steps, which I do for the many challenges that I participate in regularly. It would take the steps from my phone and my galaxy fit and collect all my steps for the day. Well over the course of the last few months there are periods where it won't pick up the steps from the watch! I've tried everything to sync it and it DOES NOT WORK! Now I need to pace instead of sleep to catch steps I already have üò° so I don't lose my last free day"
"Unusable unless one discloses own tel. #. I have no interest in together, just want to record my wateraerobics, check my sleep patterns an duration, etc."
"It does basic tracking.. but is not accurate. Cycling, hiking, etc have to be manually enabled. The challenges in the Together section is filled bogus winners walking 120000 steps a day average. I do not understand how it is humanly possible for so many people to walk that! The connection to Samsung watch is ok.. there are inconsistencies between the two. Samsung can do way better!"
absolutely brilliant Fitness App works great on the Samsung galaxy s10+ and Gear s3 frontier watch. i would like though when you start a walk on the watch id like it too start on the phone as well. At the moment it doesn't do that it syncs after you stop your workout. But apart from that its great. Edit im not receiving sleep stats now since i updated my gear s3 frontier to one UI its stopped giving me sleep notifications straight after i wake up. before it did.
"Sadly, I have to put one star on this app. Before, there was the total amount button so we can see the average if it's green, red or yellow. Plus, all the new updates recently made the app stop even when I don't use it. And the latest update made it worse. I always get a notification about the ""for you"" button and the app keep stopping. Please make an update to fix all bugs and viruses because it was once a great app and you ruined it."
"The steps and sleep data not getting updated. I am using one plus mobile phone and have samsung galaxy watch. Despite all the efforts and syncing I do on Samsung health app, the details are not getting updated. This is despite the fact that data is all there in the watch and I can see it. All other bands and apps (garmin, mi, fitbit, etc) are seemless to sync but the galaxy watch and galaxy health app simply sucks."
"The app used to work but for the last couple of versions the Together feature is broken. Whenever I access the tab, the app requests account verification. After the verification, it works fine until next time. I am using only one device and SIM card so I don't really get it."
"I am from UK. I've used Samsung Health for nearly 2 years though I only retained data from 9/2017. I saw many updates over the time. It is good now that it allows much more items per meal. However, I don't know whether it is because my database had become so large, it doesn't always allow me to input food items I have eaten, copying meals from previous days are even worse and often crash. It doesn't include gardening and housework as activities that may be why I'm losing weight.. WORD LIMIT .."
very frustrated as I just got a new phone and all the food I manually entered before has transferred over HOWEVER the app outlet me select any of those items. I have deleted/re-installed the app s few times with no change. The app is ok for basic health tracking but its not worth the effort to re-add all my food items from scratch so if it's not fixed I'll stop using it.
"I've been using this app for years as my primary fitness tracker and have found it adequate. Recently, however, the app has been messing up. The biggest issue I have right now is that it will not read my steps. Google Fit recorded a 4.0 mile run with over 7k steps. Samsung Health recorded no activity and my steps are at 1.3k for the day, even after running 4.0 miles. This has been going on for months and my app is up-to-date."
"Long time samsung note / galaxy watch user here. I thought to share my recent opinion abut where samsung is heading. 1. You can't view the weight chart in monthly resolution. Isn't this the ultimate goal for most people - to see progression in weigth loss?! 2. Samsung put ads! In the app. After buying top end samsung gear, i can't tolerate this, and you should not either! Hence the 1 star. 3. This is a personal opinion, but the new UI looks terribe. Conclusion: time to get a garmin watch."
Used app for almost a year now and all of a sudden (since 8/2) its not calculating calories burned during auto-detected workouts or ones where i entered my own data. My treadmill has always counted my calories fairly accurate to the app and my 45-min hikes have always been ‚âà500 cals. Now its saying (even when I enter data) my 45-minute hike only burned 48 cals. I entered a crazy long distance and duration and it won't go higher than 48 cals. Very annoyed...
This app is cool for tracking your meals and water but that's about it. It doesn't track your workouts well nor does it syncs your steps after being in a no service area. I mean Pok√©mon go tracks my steps much more accurately than this app. If they would fix this I would use it more often. For now I just download other apps because this just doesn't do the job.
"my last two workouts have been recorded inaccurately. I complete the workout the correct distance shows,when I select done, the distance us shorted 1-2 miles. there have been other errors but this one has annoyed me the most. I will be uninstalling to reinstall. I had already checked updates so I hope this will correct the inaccuracies."
"I'll go for a run, it will record it. But for some reason doesnt upload the run to the app. It will upload a different workout afterwards but just won't accept the run. Rebooting the galaxy fit erases the run and its gone. Makes trying to use the app to track certain things useless. Same issues with auto workouts as always. Going for a ride on my motorcycle triggers a bike ride. Using a Samsung galaxy fit with a Samsung s20 ultra phone. So I dont think its using a competing phone thats problem"
"‚ö†Ô∏è[ Edit : This app uses too much battery üîã e.g. 50-70 mAh. I'm using a non-samsung device. I did these given process to run the application. Please help!!! ] üÜò ******** The application and UI experience is very great. It works on non-samsung devices too. The work that you have to do is go to the:- Settings < Battery < High background power consumption < Samsung health < Turn on OK. The problem of not working in other brands smartphones is their heavy UI. That's why it doesn't work. Thank you,"
"My default app for walking. Easy to use and for the most part accurate. One annoying things, each time I open it to start a new session i get this message ""GPS signal week"". This is while I am still connected to my wifi so not sure why it does that."
"I am disappointed in the last update. I use this app on a daily basis to track my weight and blood sugar. It was nice that you could display those things by weekly or monthly averages. Now that feature is gone, which makes tracking those things much more difficult and the app much less usefu for me. Please bring those averaging features back."
"UPD: Its been 4 months and nothing has changed. Initial review: Recently Samsung Health stopped registering my went to bed time. It was very accurate always before, noticing I used my phone last in the night, which happened to be really useful. For about two weeks now all it does in the morning is suggesting my target time as the time ilI went to bed, be it before or after the time I was still on the phone, using it actively. I hope its a bug that will be fixed with the next update."
"I have been using this app for about 5 years now. However this latest update is awful, I now will be looking for another app to use. The main this I miss is the weight trends, as my weight fluctuates I used the average weight for the week function which has now gone (I can't find it anyway). The layout/look of it all has now changed which I don't like either. Samsung you need to go back, it looks like a lot of other people don't like this update either."
The app stopped working on my Unlocked Note 9 after a recent update. I sent two emails to support and to date have had no response. The error message says that the app won't run on a rooted phone. My phone was purchased unlocked at a major retailer but not rooted per the error message. It functioned for several months until the update. Samsung has not been responsive and hence the poor rating reflecting the poor service.
Why was the caloric balance feature removed? It was definitely a very useful feature for monitoring and managing weight and for some reason the developers suddenly decided to remove it? What are they thinking? The app now feels incomplete without that feature. I might as well use underarmor's similar app. I hope they will return that feature asap.
"I have been using this app for quite a long time now and never faced any critical issue however since last Android update there is an issue, while running it keeps on autopausing the workout due to which it is either not able to capture the accurate data or I have to keep on resuming it after every autopause. For developers pls check and resolve this issue or I will have to switch to 3rd party app as my health monitor."
"After perservering for over two years the latest update is just too much.... why so much personal information to activate? Despite walking an identical route every day and not getting a single identical reading on distance, with variable calories burnt against identical times. I have concerns about accuracy. Notification alarms are completely erratic, or do not work at all. The latest update encouraged me to find another app something I should have done long ago. No reply required. Uninstalled."
"Worked ok until Android update. Now it won't sync with my watch in samsumg health at all, tells me it's synced but there's no data showing. Reset phone and watch and installed all updates, Re installed wearable app and still the same. Watch over 1 year old but will be going back as faulty and not fit for purpose if it isn't fixed soon. It seems samsumg only really support there newer watches to make me buy another as the 4 syncs fine."
"I like this app! Ideas for improvement: - Include syncing with more fitness apps, also fix it so that it goes both ways (e.g. in case of Endomondo). - Improve algorithm for auto-recording of different kinds of activities (many times while biking, it's recognized as walking!) - Possibility to enable GPS-tracking if activity is automatically recorded. - Possibility to export data (e.g. step count OR activities and calories burnt) in CSV format, directly from the app, without the need of any additional app, while being able to CHOOSE which datasets are to be exported (the curretly exportable CSVs are messy and contain lot of information that's polluting the data the users actually need)."
Latest upgrade has shut down the whole App...not happy! Samsung subsequently contacted me and gave a phone number that would not connect and no solution. I eventually fixed the issue by doing a backup and removing and reinstalling the App. This simply should NOT happen with an App update and I'm sure I would not be the only one.
I use to love this app for being able to track many health related things. But with the recent update they have taken away being able to track your weight. This is one major aspect people want to track on their health journey. I now find myself searching for another health and fitness app to use. Makes me question my Samsung smart watch as well.
"it's okay. I don't really use it often. I like keeping track of the food I eat to make sure I'm getting enough calories everyday. theres a huge database of food down to specific brands or restaurants. but the nutritional profile, or the serving size, isn't always accurate."
I was very happy with this app. I had it sync with MyFitnessPal for the steps. Everything was working great. Suddenly it stopped and when I try to sync it it will give me an error. Unable to connect to the server to synchronize. Anyone has any idea what I can do?
"Ok but doesn't always communicate with the Samsung watch. Sometimes it doesn't count over half of your steps Edit: don't listen to their nonsense about clearing the cache, I did that, doesn't work. Also don't bother contacting them, they don't respond with anything besides generic mush. Before the update everything worked perfectly...all this for the sake of using an emoji!? That's not an important feature in my opinion"
"Recently purchased a Galaxy Active 2 watch for fitness purposes. Moving from fitbit I've found this app has lacked some features. Thankfully, Samsung and Under Armour are compatible. I decided I would follow their directions for setting up Myfitnesspal and a couple other UA apps for use in tracking and working out. After setting up the sync settings in both SHealth and MFP, NONE of the data syncs to SHealth. And nothing from SHealth (water/caffeine intake, steps, calories, etc) sync to MFP!!!!"
Samsung will not fix the issue with the 5 g it his been over and they still have not fix it I will not buy any more from them do wast your money if your looking for 5 g
The app requires a sim card to be present on the device before it lets you sign in. This is a horrible design choice from the devs. Changing phones is difficult enough and this app is certainly not worth the extra trouble. Needing a SIM card for an app to work despite having a wifi connection also brings to mind some questionable practices of possible data mining. Why would a health app need more than a wifi and a Bluetooth connection? Edit: the contact us form doesn't work.
"Great app, has all necessary features and more. Though I have a problem, there used to be a meter showing whether you are in a calorie deficit or excess, I would like that back. It was quite motivating, in a way, now I have to calculate if I'm in excess or deficit."
Don't know what has happened in the last week... But since I updated it is no longer displaying my steps when I view the trend... On the day itself it displays the current amount of steps... But then the next day it is wiped to 0. Have done data clear as well as reinstallation *Update something finally worked... Because my steps from the whole of the last week magically appeared as well (it's synced with my Samsung account)
"It doesn't show an option to record RHR or Stress Level. They don't even show up as options. After spending 45 min on phone just trying to get my account set up without having access to old phone this was a nightmare. Then finally able to access samsung account and I can't even record my stress levels or RHR and they don't even show up as options. What is wrong with Samsung, I'm about to switch to Apple. This has been incredibly frustrating and a waste of just over an hour of my day Not happy!"
"A lot of the functionality that I've used has been removed due to the recent upgrade, including being able to see my weekly and calendar monthly trends for steps, the rolling 7, 31 and yearly data are not useful.The number of healthy steps has also been removed. These were really useful functions that I've been using to monitor recovery post illness.I'm going to look at an alternative app now. Don't respond to this by asking me to call an expensive overseas number. That's bad customer service."
"I see a lot of negative reviews lately.. All I can say is that for me personally the app has been working great. I like using one app for food, weight, exercise etc. I would like to see the following changes **Provide ability to scan bar codes to enter food **provide ounces option for food weight **in exercise modes I would love the system to provide the time for each mile (splits) instead of current overall."
"A fitness app that wants access to your call logs and such! No thanks samsung! I don't care if you try to justify yourself by saying it's for the together feature. The fact of the matter is that not everyone wants the feature, so we shouldn't be forced to give up a permission for something that we will never use. Just stop! These unnecessary permissions is enough to make me switch phone providers. RESPECT OUR PRIVACY!!!"
"Two updates in 10/20...and STILL no weight tracking returned. Still sucks as an app. I destest your update. Why in Hell would you REMOVE the calorie tracker for weight goals???!! It was a fast, convenient way to see when, and what, I could eat and still reach my calorie balance goals for the day. The FAQ suggests ANOTHER APP to do this...like I want another app on my phone when the previous version was just fine. If I'm adding another app I don't need this one. Please give me ny options back!"
"This app used to check all my boxes. Up until the last update ( which I was forced to do üòë ) it would have gotten 5 stars from me. I'm not sure if it's under development or what...but PLEASE bring back the weight management/ calorie counter widget. Outside of the step counter, this was my main tool to use. The app doesn't seem as useful anymore üòï. Please bring it back."
"Ok app. I use it mostly to count steps and track weight. I don't like that when you add an exercise activity, it adds the minutes and the calories, but not the steps. I also don't like getting a message every day around 12:07am saying that I haven't taken any steps yet for the day and I should try taking a walk. If it came through at 10am, it wouldn't bother me as much. But when the day is 7 minutes old and most of the time I'm sleeping, it gets irritating. Please take that off."
"I would give this more stars, but every time they update their stress tracker or heart rate tracker or oxygen level tracker THEY THROW AWAY YOUR HISTORY. It becomes quite useless without the history. Either delineate when the changes occur, or give us the chance to offload it before you delete it without permission."
The only thing worse than this app is the Galaxy Watch Active 2 itself. The heart rate is wildly inconsistent. My heart rate is all over the place even though my running pace is very consistent. I mean there are times when my heart rate never goes above 100 during a run. What a joke and horrible piece of technology. The app struggles with proper calorie burning tracking along with distance tracking. The distance is never the same even though my pace is very consistent.
"Doesn't sync with the Samsung Galaxy Active 2 watch majority of the times, it doesn't record the watch data majority of the times. Then should I keep a track on my fitness, sleep etc ? App developers, please give a look into this and fix the problem. The number given by you is an invalid number. Give a valid number atleast, or give me an alternate"
"Overall good fitness app. The GPS seems questionable at times on my watch. I have a single feature I would like to see - remove the 10 minute warm up and cool down period from the running coach workout, or don't have them be included in the duration. I want to say ""run 5 miles for 45 minutes"" to pace myself at 9 mins/mile, not have to say ""run 5 miles at 55 minutes"" to account for the added 10 minutes tacked on by warm up/cool down. Including these messes up overall distance as well."
"Never rooted my phone, but after last update all I get is some warning saying Samsung Health wont work because my phone is rooted. Additionally, latest Samsung Health update for my Gear S3 took away a lot of functionality I was using. Really makes me want to move off of the Samsung platform. I have the latest version of Android. I have uninstalled and reinstalled. I have forced the app to stop. None of this works."
"Just started using this app again. I tried iPhones out and got away from samsung. Don't like iPhone and don't like the changes in this app. This app feels like an iPhone now... it's streamlined and easy to navigate but not as customizable as before. Gave it five stars, because it is still usable and free. However the big ad on top really stinks. Maybe I'll switch to a pixel and try google fit next phone upgrade."
"Hallo I was enjoying this app, but as of last Monday it seems to be stuck. There's a new upgrade, which I'm desperately trying to install, but to know used. It's not counting my steps, Monday I went biking, it didn't record the distance, and now I can't get rid of the bike on the watch, neither the sign of the telephone on the watch. I really thought that the active 2 was much better. I'm really disappointed the meat fact that I'm even having problem checking the time on the watch."
"I really do love this app! It helps keep me accountable tbh.. I can keep track of my intake of food and water, right along with keeping track of my sleep schedule and little tips on how to stay healthy! The only thing that I wish I could add is the ability to link YouTube workouts as well. It is still amazing and i would reccomend it to everyone, in fact i have been bugging people to be friends! ü•∞ü§£"
"Recently, sleep data from my Galaxy watch Active 2 has not been syncing with Samsung health. Please fix this!"
Good one stop shop for all your health tracking. I use it for tracking my weight weekly. Great for connecting up with my samsung watch and tracking my walking and excercise. Also has an expanded collection of excercises in the app compared to the watch so when I'm playing golf the app tracks that. I also like the community aspect where it compares your weekly steps to the global community and the step challenges are a good motivator.
There is no need for access to make calls. This is a fitness app not a phone calling app. This permission is not necessary and opens opportunities for security risks. Was a good app but good features were slowly being eroded. The developers cannot give any good reason on why it needs access to make calls especially when other apps that do the same do not need it. If this is not changed I will have no option but to uninstall and delete all my data with Samsung.
"There doesn't appear to be an option to change units for energy, i.e. Kcal or calories to KJ Kilojoules. I'm not going to call your USA based phone number to talk about it either. I'm also disappointed that the app doesn't have any suitable way of tracking weightlifting workouts or integrating with any other apps that do. Samsung should really go and look at some of the best diet and weight training apps to get some ideas. People do more than just run, walk, ride, and swim."
"New update has messed up the search option! Can only search 1 item unless you exit & return. This is time consuming & annoying. Also, why can't we delete meals/foods from those we've entered? List is long full of foods/meals I no longer eat. Please give users the option to return to previous versions until ALL bugs are fixed!!!! I'm sure there's more but I have to go enter my lunch 1 new food at a time. ü•¥üò©üò´"
"Horribly disappointed with the new update. Used to love it - but the new home screen and user interface has me looking for another tracking app. As many other users have stated: too much wasted space, what used to be a one screen overview is now a scrolling nightmare. I enjoyed having a ""one-stop"" screen - in fact it was what I liked best about SHealth - this update was, in my opinion, a horrible idea. At least give us the option to uninstall the update... or something!"
"It's a pretty good app, however the latest updates, which prevent the update of steps from other apps, is frustrating. I own a Garmin, and naturally I don't run with my phone on me, so the actual steps are much higher. L.E. the clear cache did NOT work. Health Sync is useless with Health, no step sync from Garmin at all. 1500 E on a phone and the health app does not sync with 3rd party sport watches. GJ :/"
"S health is a relatively good lifestyle tracker, however there are several things that I believe the fitbit app does better. 1. On S health, calories burned cannot be changed when logging exercise. Often calories burned on the app are very low, and this makes me worry about getting a samsung watch in case it is equally as inaccurate 2. On fitbit, if you type in 'omelette' you get a general option and can change egg size etc. On S health, you can only input shop-bought items."
"Great while it worked. Phone (gs8) had a security update last night and now this app won't open, saying unauthorized changes were made to the system. Google suggests this happens when a phone has been rooted, which is not the case here. Ran scans and it says it is clean..."
"Disappointed this won't sync with Fitbit for my Aria scales, used to use a 3rd party app for this but Samsung seemed to have blocked it. Would have made sense if they were allowing syncing themselves but nope, just done it to be difficult. Most likely will return to fitbit which is a shame because the Samsung watch is better imo."
I really like the fact that you can and to your stress test and get your heart rate and the walking amount of steps you've taken or running however there's a lot of garbage in this to like a talk to it doctor and the thing that's what a waste of space it's all most everything on there is just a waste of space on our phones! some of the questions below are irrelevant a nutrition thing would be nice if it actually worked but doubtful I'd rather have the space on the phone!
This app is a great motivator providing one regularly carries out the schedule exercise programmes. Tracking of weekly programmes enables one to look back and see past performance and the monitoring of food intake is very good. This part if taken seriously does help.to build up one's weight loss or weight gain and ensuring that eating nutritional food makes a person healthier. It is an app that will help anyone to benefit their well being.
"Tried the ol' ""have you tried turning it off & on"" trick by reinstalling but now it's become worse. Opens for a few secs and closes itself. No sensors for checking heart rate, etc. App was fine before, why fix it if it ain't broke? Took away great features and created an overly fancy step tracker. Contact info for app is a 'noreply' email, clearly Samsung is getting too big to care about what the people need if they're selling $1500 phones and making them LESS useful."
"Used this a few years back and used to be able to measure heart rate/stress with just my phone. Now I need a watch/band? Ridiculous. It also seems the most recent update wants access to your calls to use the app, which has absolutely nothing to do with any of the app's features. This is absolutely unacceptable."
"This app is okay but I'm not happy about only being able to track 3 exercises. I'm doing a lot more than just biking, walking, elliptical, crunches etc and I'm only able to track 3 of them. :( If there is a way around this it would be great. Additionally, im finding that my Samsung Galaxy Watch doesn't seem to be very accurate when calculating my reps. :("
"Just to reiterate the past few reviewers... I used to use this app a TON but I'm not interested in giving this app the ability to make calls. Crazy. Their response to Joe (a reviewer) that they need these permissions to provide an optimal experience, doesn't work for me. My experience was fine and it didn't need to be MORE optimal. And if I don't want MORE optimal, I should be able to opt out. Sorry samsung, but I'm out..."
Last update make counting step error and not auto
I really enjoy the app. I walk alot and find that this challenges me to push just a little more to get even more steps in. I do wish I could set some of my own goals tho. I made it a personal goal to walk 30k steps one day and it would be nice to input that into the app as a personal goal to reach. also if you could have smaller goals for people who dont walk as much or cant to encourage their progress.
"Great app, except recent update... Why did you get rid of the weight management tool? Update: downgraded by one final start. Held out hope they would bring back the weight management feature. They clearly are not. This app is essentially useless to me without it. Myfitnesspal does the same, don't need both apps."
"latest update removed the weight tracker portion of the app which is basically the only reason to use it. But on top of that when I downgraded the app and turned off auto updates it updated to the latest version after a day. Also the new colors chosen for daily intake is extremely difficult to see the difference in fat, protein and carbs because of my red green color blindness. Please revert back to the previous patch this is really frustrating considering how far I've gotten with my weight loss"
"How about addressing people obviously cheating for the monthly steps. First of February and some already have over 200,000 in a day physically impossible to do needs to be addressed."
"Very frustrated by the latest update; removing weekly and monthly weight scores and replacing with a daily trend line is terrible. The weekly weight measurement was the main way I track progress, daily is far too granular. Would recommend to others not to update if you can, I'll need to find a new weight tracking app unless this is fixed soon."
"Pretty annoyed after this update, it removed things i used on a daily basis. Namely in the nutrition section, fat is completely gone, i am on a mainly protein and fat diet and low carb diet. I need to make sure my fat intake is at a certain level equal or higher than protein now the app is useless to me. Been using it for a month on the old format and it was perfect for me personally, oh and fewer notifications now i get spammed. Key life lesson to live by, if it ain't broke dont fix it."
"The weight managment feature was great and helped keeping my weight on track. I do not see a reason why you had to remove it. Also, the macronutrient scale used to have three distinct colours, now, they're all shades of green this makes it hard to defrentiate between them."
"I love your app and it's been a great resource for tracking nutrition but I wish you had an option for pregnancy, as the nutritional needs of a pregnant woman are different than someone who isn't pregnant. Please consider this for future updates. Also if you could have more options for size, ie half an orange or apple instead of just grams or cal, that would be very useful. Thank you for all your hard work"
"The nutrients in the meal tracking is incorrect or missing. Even on simple foods like cucumbers, jicama, or spinach. How can my raw veggies have no vitamins in them? How can my cracklins have 0 fat? The UI is also lacking in options to change portion sizes of food you are trying to record. They should switch from using fatsecrets data base or at least incorporate a label scanning function to the app to import nutrition information. It is useful for sleep, water, and heart rate tracking."
The app continues to crash on opening. I have tried uninstalling and re downloading with no success. I've been using the app for years so far successfully. Thank you for the feedback but the app crashes immediately so I can not access settings.
"Fantastic App. Love the ""Together"" feature. A friend who is in the US and I are challenging each other. As she is very fit, and I have been sedentary, this has been 'forcing' üòÇ me to walk at least 1 1/2 hours a day. Yes there is a slight difference between the count on my Gear and the app, but this is clearly explained in the latter and I like the choice given on purely relying on the Gear, the app or allowing a combination of both. Suggestions: 1. Allow for conversion of another exercise to an equivalent in steps 2. Increase the choice of food in the repository 3. Choice between kcal/kjoules. 4. Ability to use the app so that the ""Together"" feature can be used with people who have another smart watch brand eg Garmin. Note: there is no way I'm getting rid of my GF2. I've bought other family members GF2s as gifts."
"Excellent app, keeps all my health related stats in one place - from fitness and activity, all the way through period, sleep, stress and pulse info. It imports data from my scales and BP monitor without a fault. On top of this, the Together challenges, however globally rigged they are infamous to be, are fun. Love it, keep it up!"
"Love the app! Use it daily! Synced with my Google fit. Would love if in one of the updates you could set notifications to remind you to eat or drink water. When you get busy throughout the day, sometimes you don't realize how much time has gone by. I have a caloric intake goal and reminders would be helpful."
"This app was pre-installed on my phone, enjoyed using it, since last update, can't get passed the sign in page, I uninstalled/reinstalled just now, so I know I have the latest version, useless now. Thanks for responding, however, I cannot get to settings>contact us, because I STILL can't get past the sign in page! If you could just fix that, I'd be happy. Edit: today's update still didn't fix it, wants me to sign in, never had to before, not going to now."
"Had the app and liked it very much, used it to check steps etc. But this evening when I wanted to check my running and distance in the app, it said it needs permissions and access to my phone calls?! I ticked no, then it wouldn't start until I allowed all permissions-which I reluctantly did- but then it still asked to go to settings and allow permissions which obviously didn't work and the app just wouldn't open/run! What is going on here? Why do you need access to my calls, or photos?"
"What I'd like to see is for walking and running is to set a pace by mph. That way I can tell if I'm running fast enough to run a distance in x amount of time. For instance, in the fitness program for running a 10k. It tells you when to speed up or slow down. I'd like for that to be an option when you select an exercise, the can set pace speed as a target option. That way can easily keep the same pace while running or walking."
"I liked the global leaderboard feature, but after the latest update it disappeared. Sleep record is now uneditable, I can't remove periods of time that the app count as ""sleep"", even if they are not. Overall, the latest update is the worst I've seen on Samsung health in the last 8 years."
"This app used to work great, but since the update has stopped communicating with Humana's Go365. I had no issues prior to the update. Now it won't work with the other app in spite of uninstalling/reinstalling, instating permissions in both apps, etc. If they can get this to work again my rating would change to 5. My husband has a brand new Samsung Galaxy and is having the same issue."
"I like the app and it works well, but I wish there was a way to track a general crossfit workout w/o having to give the details of the workout. This is too time consuming. Would also like to go back to prior days to add a workout, so far app only allows for same day workout adds."
"Why is this app getting so much confusing??? I was using the ""First attempt at 10K"". Ok I was behind schedule but the app just removed it from my app dashboard. Now I can't find it anywhere in the app. There is nothing mentioned. Previously it used to be in the running section. I clicked the 3 dots and in it showed the exercise programmes. There is NOTHING there. Just some audio settings and its instructions. I want that running programme. Or guide me. I also sent a question but no reply."
"This is the best app out there for counting calories, get informations in about your diet and fitness, it has an amazing food and exercices data base. The galaxy fit with this app are working magic. The app calculations are simplified, there are multiple measures, and my favorite is all the information about the nutritional intake of each meal/food. The only thing that is missing is the incapacity to set goals for your recommended macros. Update ‚ù£Ô∏èBut you can still follow them. Better than pal"
"Every update either removes something useful, introduces bugs, or just makes everything confusing to navigate. With important data such as blood glucose being logged with this app....at what point does it become criminal? Don't offer an app to log important health metrics...if you can't reliably retrieve the information when needed. I mean it's class action lawsuit level negligence to be at your doctor saying ""Well the app updated and I can't find a way to display that data anymore"""
"Since the last update it's useless, it forces 2FA and makes you log in, then you can choose to not activate it and makes you log in again only to give you de error ""ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED"". If you try sending an email good luck because you can't submit it and the FAQ doesn't address this. Update: as I said before, I can't send an email through the app, I press submit and nothing happens"
"Over it! Two S3s quit syncing with MyFitnessPal and Stava earlier this year. No fix, web is ablaze with frustrated users much like myself. Now looking for alternatives. I have to sync with my Wellness Program at work to avoid increased contributions. Come on Samsung! Really? 2019-07-01. Still no fix. This seriously sucks."
"Same complaint. No to permissions. Again more useful info is either deleted or you spend way too much time trying to find info you need. Another thing, my watch 2 would track all my activities. Walking, running, hiking, skiing, training. Now you have to pick 3. Some are on the phone app...skiing. but not on the watch. The mileage is also suspect. I hike 6 miles. My watch stops tracking, boyfriends apple watch keeps the mileage ( he even has bad cell service When my watch catches up its wrong"
"Ive always loved this app and used to be very accurate. Ever since last update, when using it during cycling, it has not been accurate with the milage anymore, ecen when swtting thr battery saver to OFF. Are you requiring that Mobile Data be turned on now like the rest of the exercise apps üò†. If this is not fixed, and cant find anything in the settings, i really hate to but i will have to find a different exercise app. PLEASE FIX THIS"
"Thanks for listening. Sync with My Fitness Pal work great, and there are more running programs. improved and if it accurately recorded calories burned during a workout. Factoring the HRM into the calorie burn calculation would be great but it seems that very few fitness apps exercises that do that. Granted, Samsung could be ahead of the pack...."
"Compreheensive and good fitness app. But lately there have been some issues: 1) Went for a run with Samsung Galaxy Fit, distance time and pace correctly recorded on the watch. But after sync the app shows incorrect pace, although it shows correct distance and time. Just the math of pace calculation was wrong. 2) Went for another run with the watch, again all info correctly recorded on the watch. But this time the app shows totally incorrect time, though pace and distance are correct."
"I love my Samsung smart watch and all I can do with it. From tracking my run to answering phone calls and texts! The only complaint I have is that since the update on 11/27/19, it isn't calculate calories burned correctly. It is saying I am burning half the calories I really am. Developers, if you could please correct this issue... I will gladly give 5 stars incentive fixed!"
Love the many cool features of this app especially during Lockdown as it will work out how many calories you need based on your activity levels. Two things.. The weekly overview is not working. The last overview is in April and its now June. Also it measures recommended nutrients but I cant enter or cross track the multivitamins I'm taking so this isn't accurate. With appreciation of your work!
"Loved this app as well. Disappointed in the new requirement that Samsung has access to make and answer calls. Definitely an overstep. It was the ONLY app I could use with my Samsung watch. In Samsungs efforts to collect unnecessary data, they are now preventing people from staying healthy and tracking their health outcomes. When it comes to cost and benefit, this was not a feature worth the cost of thousands of users switching to new software."
"Samsung just keeps removing features. Weight management I used for a long time to calculate calories needed to shed weight at a certain rate, and caffeine tracking was also nice. Sucks that they keep removing stuff and requiring more permissions. Why would I ever get any wearable gear from Samsung if this is the direction that they are going with their fitness app? Great phones, but really questionable support for their apps and ecosystem. Instead use myfitnesspal or Garmin connect, or both!"
"The latest update killed body sensor use on my s10. Also, the inability to see stats and work out a plan, print charts on a computer etc is a real bummer. I generally like the app though, it just feels like it's going in the wrong direction."
"This used to be great, but the new update jammed it up. My weekly summary suddenly stopped appearing and suddenly the step tracking is inaccurate in a way it wasn't before. The only positive that I see from the recent update is that it more accurately tracks when I run."
"EXERCISE SELECTIONS: I like the app, it does what it is supposed to do. The problem is I have it connected to my watch and several of the exercise selections are not on my watch. i NEED Boxing, Aqua Aerobics, and Cycling on my watch app, and out of the three, I am only able to get Cycling. I have to guess what to use in place of the actual on phone. If you can change this please do."
The app is easy to use and set up. I find it doesn't always sync properly with my watch or phone. It would be great in the food section if there was an option to scan the barcode of products in addition to trying to find them in the list where there isn't an option to change the amount you've had.
"I would like to have the following things in this app: 1) in item ""food"" I would like to have more number of nutrients such as magnesium, chlorine and other. It would also to be nice to have a count of individual amino acids. 2) in item ""weight"" I would like to be able to change scale of the graph that shows my weight for a certain period of time."
"*I've been using this app for years and its worked fine without the need for Samsung to have access to contacts and phone shame on Samsung, this need for people's data is ridiculous! How does this enable optimization of the app?? Especially if you don't use the together feature.The annoying thing is I've fully committed to Samsung products, phone, TV, watch etc. Disappointed. Samsung - please listen to your customers ! The generic answer from Samsung is BS, please do better!"
"Ok app but needs work. Not sure why ab-roller is not in the list of exercises being so common, perhaps samsung takes notice in the future and adds to the list. I used to have a garmin vivoactive 3 and although I find the samsung watch somewhat superior, I do find the garmin connect software app somewhat superior to the samsung app; I hope samsung improves it in the future; I am trying to give the new update a chance, but like the saying states; if it ain't broke, don't fix it"
"Recent update made it useless! Used to work brilliantly by calling out updates every 1km (eg. Total distance, total time and average pace over total distance). Now it only calls out 1km laps and only gives info for that lap! No one runs laps and only wants info on that lap only! Obviously updated by someone who's never run in their life. No amount of changing settings brings back the original set up of simply giving overall run updates every km. Wish I could give less than 1 star."
"App was really good until the last update. It now maps the same walk differently every other time. One time it just shows a starting point and then a line and it is about 1/2 mile shorter than the actual walk, and then the next time it shows the actual walk path with the correct mileage."
"To everyone concerned about permissions! I Reinstalled the App giving full permissions. Then went to settings and removed permissions. The app works fine. Then I selected to access the friends option, and it ask to turn permissions on. Leave it off if you don't want it. REVISED I understand it could be needed to encompass all the great features. PS:SAMSUNG! BEST PHONE EVER !!! REVIEW REVISED "" What's the purpose for these features and please let the consumer decide."
"Best health app with one major problem: it crashes on a constant basis. I use the app on my Galaxy S10 5G without root or any modifications whatsoever, but every second or third time I open the app it just crashes to the home screen after I tap anything. How did Samsung manage to build an App that crashes this often on their own hardware?! And it's not like my phone is out of date or cheap. Besides this major problem I enjoy the app - especially because of the good integration with my watch."
"The app is good but the monthly global challenges are a joke. People are finishing 200,000 steps in one day and this is not being stopped by samsung health. Really makes you not want to partake in the activities. In regards to smartwatch support you can delete activities off the app for samsung watches and the activities do not disappear from the watch. Having a way to remove steps and floors from driving a vehicle would be a good addition."
What has happened? I can't get into my app suddenly. Keeps saying something about settings. Help! I use this every day! Update.. I had to reinstall after which it showed me the interface it had failed to show before. Seemed to have trouble loading it but now it's working again.
With the last update you destroyed this app. I have been using it for 5 years and no issue with Google signed in. Now? I've been completely kicked out! Why did you change something good?? Steps and such are still being tracked but cannot get into the app. Will NOT contact support for this. It is something that should not have been changed in the first place.
I am uninstalling after the latest update removed a critical function.  It has a many of negatives which now outweigh the positives.  Samsung removed the O2 readings from the items.  it is still part of the stress but that tracker is nearly worthless since it rarely completes its reading unless I am at rest.  O2 reading can be taken in the middle of exercise & give both heart rate and O2.  The negatives include an insensitivity to finger taps especially when trying to take a reading.
"Doesn't it count steps realtime anymore? I noticed it is bulk updating the steps every couple of minutes since this morning.. Update : i followed your instructions and still did not work so I backed up health data and uninstalled the app. After installing the app back the step count was fixed but all my data, yeats of experience and challenge results were gone despite backing up!! It is utterly disappointing.. Did you actually read my update before responding???? I am said that all data is lost"
"Still having bad experience. Damn thing keeps going CONSTANTLY from portrait mode to landscape when I don't have it enabled on phone(especially in heart rate tracker) . Fitness notifications Im not interested in, want or able to turn them off. On the + side they at some point fixed the insane battery draining problem. Watch went from full to empty in under 20hours."
"I do not get better results since update it seems the sensor only detects if you are so laid back you're practically asleep. Useless now. It used to measure stress, heart rate and blood oxygen but only if, as I said above, or you don't have cold hands. Pointless now and stressing me out. Way to go. Time to uninstall and move on to ""real"" upgrades."
"Can't believe the new changes. I used to be able to have an overview of a month by month weight tracking of average weight to make comparison on how I'm progressing each month going back two years,which is highly motivating and you decided to remove this,which make me contemplate deleting this app or even choosing an iPhone for my next phone and using their fitness tracker. I see you have updated the steps tracker,which is hilarious as most of the world (at least Europe) is in lockdown"
The app doesn't accurately compute my weight bmr and bmi to tell me how many calories I need to consume to loose weight. I only use the app to help keep track of fitness water and caffeine as well as the mindfulness exercises. It also does not sync to all scales. I have the Tanita RD 901 which does not sync. 50% of the app is good to track stress mindfulness water and caffeine but not weightloss.
"This app used to be awesome my only complaint was that you can't go in and add or edit a workout. After the last update it glitches, and makes it extremely frustrating that I can't edit the workout, or add one when the app fails to track it. üòë"
"Attempted to use to no avail. Received message that app would not function on rooted phone. Uninstalled and reinstalled to receive a message that unauthorized changes were made to my phone and to contact customer service. The only thing I can think is that i may have a refurbished phone given i had to obtain a replacement through my insurance due to damage. Every other app works with zero issues though. No thanks, this app has wasted enough of my life and I will seek out a competitor's product."
"Update: I paused step counting on settings under steps. Seems like it helped alot, not draining battery much since then. Also disabled auto workout detection, it probably helped too. You could've advised me to try them :). Also stoping step counting setting is like hidden deep inside the steps menu. It must be more visible and reachable for users/customers. - Drains phone battery too much!. - There must be setting to disable app so users can disable it when not in use to save battery on phone."
Latest update is buggy and doesn't log sleep correctly. I wish the challenges with friends was more than just steps. And it's totally demoralizing to the loser. You get this frowny-face icons with the eyes crossed out. There's no incentive to actually work with a friend to encourage each other to succeed on a common goal.
"READ ALL USER AGREEMENTS! Tons of access is given to them and 3rd parties. If they don't allow 3rd parties then why is it in the contract? The user appears more responsible than Samsung for problems. The app was pre loaded, I used it & liked it. I removed my SIM & SD cards and then was asked to agree to the agreements again when I tried to use the app. I then removed the app after reading the agreements. Their access appears too invasive with no responsibility. Good luck shutting it off too."
"Used for a month with no issues to track my running. However an annoying issue has occured in the past week where during a work out the app will pause my progress multiple times, to which I have to manually click resume everytime. Rather frustrating and shake since I've no prior issues."
"Doesnt work. Tried all of the trouble shooting, 2-step verification, uninstall/reinstall, clearing cache and data, rebooting phone, force closing app and just get the loading wheel. Have downloaded Strava on the smart watch so will link for some activities, but would like the health as will link across all apps then and more choice of exercises."
"Mental that it requires details of your contacts and phone calls; whereas the activity data is optional. No other reason than selling data under the guise of providing an ""optimal experience"". Insane."
"What happened to my trends? I used to be able to view monthly, weekly, and daily trends for each category (weight, water, blood glucose, etc.). This option is no longer available. I used the trends to view my progress over time and determine my averages, especially for blood glucose. Looks like I'll be ditching this app for one that will give me what I want."
"I loved the older version of this app but the latest version is trying to force you to purchase more Samsung hardware to gain the features back that they removed. There is no reason for me to contact you, it's simply a business decision on Samsung's part which is your privilege. As a consumer I can either accept it and purchase more hardware that seems to have a short life span or move on to another vender for the the service you have chosen to remove."
"I used to love this app. Now it is overengineered. It used to be real stable, now the app shuts off all by itself all the time. I was trying to meet my daily activity record only to discover half way thru my workout that the app had simply shut itself off. Whatever update they did made this app more frustrating than helpful. I wish they would fix it. I am no longer getting accurate info. It is way too sensitive. Today I started the walking exercise. It shut itself off 2seconds later."
Why can't I see my steps in the notification pull down anymore? Why change something that basic?
"Downloaded this to my new galaxy and when I open it loads for 5 seconds then error notice pops up at the bottom of the page. I uninstall it and tried again multiple times same issue,I uninstalled it and went to Samsung store only to have the same problem.i always get this amazing app when I get a new phone so to not be able to has gutted me."
"I love this app because of the fact it tracks my steps. One thing I really hate is that I can't track heart rate, o2, or stress since Nov 2020 for o2 and stress and Nov 2021 for heart rate and currently with having covid and asthma they wanted me to track it and your app was the only one that would. I have an s10 lite so no idea why I can't anymore since I was able to track something last year"
"I can't open this app. I keep getting an error report. Just bought a samsung watch and now I cant use it. Cleared cache and data, uninstalled and installed, turned phone off and on, tried everything. Phone support and got no results as well as sent an error report on samsung members. Will this be fixed or do I just have to return my watch and get a fit bit?? **update: the number provided leads to samsung kids and did not help at all. Terrible phone connection and very confusing conversation."
"Samsung, please get it together. What's the point of us using the app and smartwatches if you make them obsolete by removing important features such as the weight management? It was an easy way to see if we're overcaloric or not. It seems like you guys get bored from time to time and decide to just ruin things. Please stop updating just for the sake of updating. How can I go back to a previous version of the app? This is unacceptable from your part."
"great app but it could have more features giving it more potential. it would be nice to export my data to a PDF file like my fitness pal does. a better designed app would be nice. customisation to the app such as colours, be able to set daily,weekly,monthly goals/challenges that motivates people more. a better food database like my fitness pal. barcode scanning food/drinks. be able to view my account on a desktop (a holistic view of my health and fitness through Samsung app."
Really like the app but Samsung removed the ability to delete foods from the used list. Very frustrating
"Horrendous app for tracking food. When adding custom food, and adding nutrients in %, it actually interprets it as mg. If I add 30% of calcium, it interprets it as 30mg of calcium. Today I opened the app and out of nowhere it suddenly changed from mg to %, causing all my food history to go out of wack. If you edit nutrients in a custom food item, it wont get updated until you remove it from your meal and add it again. Wish me luck, it's going to take a good hour or two to fix each food item."
"I have an S10 with the sensor on the back. This was not reading so I uninstalled app then reinstalled. What did you all do with the measure buttons? I really hope you all are not making that measure sensor on the back of my phone useless? Seriously, bring the buttons back. I read other reviews that you respond you are working on it... It looks like it has been weeks. Time to put the measure buttons back on. At least let us download an old version that works while you all fix this."
"Just got Samsung Galaxy Watch Active and using with Samsung Health app for 1st time. Steps taken inaccurate, no ability to adjust settings, same issue with floors climbed, should record as 1 floor when you go upstairs in your home but doesn't, no way to user adjust settings on that either. Somewhat disappointed. Prefer my Fitbit Charge 2 / Fitbit app."
"Good, but needs a sense of community to keep people engaged in the app (see fitbit's app - it is a whole social network). I wish I could create a blog on the app or communicate with others on it. Needs more. PS. Also do not remove useful features (weigh management - I don't even use that, but I acknowledge how important that is for some) Edit 10/9, just read you're removing more features including articles. This just makes the application less appealing. Please add useful features at least."
"I used to like using the weight management section to keep track of everything with ease. I can't even see how many calories I've burned for the day. Other apps make it easy, so I may stick with them until features that were removed can be optional once again"
"I've found this app misleading on mileage and pace. My Garmin Forerunner 235 has matched my 5k and 10k times whereas this App has had my pace as "" faster"" by 1 -2 mins per mile and my mileage almost 0.20 per mile more in distance. Which is huge!!! I've been using this as a backup but not anymore üò© I can't trust this app. It's designed to get people to like it by having them think they are progressing and doing better than what they actually are. Runners want facts !"
"Amusing to see how wildly different the numbers from Samsung are compared with my fitbit.  Somedays thousands ahead, somedays thousands behind.  And *way* too many notifications, all day, every day for anything and everything.  One bizarre problem seems to be notifications that popup telling me,. eg, ""You have achieved 86% of your step goal"", but when I press on themthey take me to whatever panel of the Health app was last visible, not necessarily anything to do with steps -- and I can't make the notification go away by swiping.  Samsung app on a Samsung S8, you'd think it'd be more reliable"
"Had the widget for steps counter ever since I got my phone. Nice , simple , straightforward. Just the number of steps on my home screen. Updated the app, now I have the number of steps/goal with the name of the app, and all of that OFF-CENTERED , and no option to change it back to the simple version. excuuuuse me? Worse widget UI update ever. I got the APK to downgrade to the last version without the widget rework, not touching that update button ever again."
"I have used this app for a while to monitor my sleep (sleep aponea) with my original 46mm watch. All worked fine. Just recently I have upgraded to a watch 4. Upgrade I thought, no it isn't. The watch doesn't recognise when I have gone off to sleep. If I get up to use the bathroom all hours sleep previous to this are lost or not recorded. Eventually the watch will start recording again. So far my experience with Watch 4 is very poor and think I should return it for a refund. Please fix ASAP."
"Updated to Samsung 20FE which unlike the s9 no longer has the ability to check your blood pressure, pulse and stress levels. The sleep tracker also doesn't work as good. Very disappointed as I found the Samsung health app invaluable and now feel lost. I do like the period/cycle tracker on it. It now appears it is prejudice to those that do not have the Samsung smart watch."
"I've been using app 1 year and have had no problems. A few days ago I dropped my Galaxy S7 and broke the LCD screen, the screen went black and I was unable to access phone. Replaced it with Samsung A425G. Samsung Health app was unable to access my Samsung Fit2 watch because it's synced to old phone, even when old phone is off and no power. I would like to use Fit2 with the data from old phone. Any specific data files that I can copy from old phone to new? Will change to 5 üåü if solution given"
"HORRIBLE update! A classic example of ""Don't fix what ain't broken"". Old version of the app had everything one could ask for; new version doesn't just offer a new (inferior) design, it actually REMOVES some of the most useful and unique features of this app. And the worst is that they didn't even ask for permission to update the app - just woke up one morning to see this new horrendous version. So disappointing."
"New interface set up the ""snacks"" category as a single item, with everything added through the day as one aggregate number. This does not allow someone to see separate snacks at different times of the day and check the numbers of calories, Etc. Not helpful for someone whose health problems require them to monitor certain numbers. Please restore separate snack time categories or allow for user-defined ones."
Not good enough...Sleep tracking needs to be improved and should be shown in a much more detailed format. For examples: one should be able to view the exact time when they went into deep sleep/ light sleep/ awake. The graph shown should be expandable when clicked upon. It needs to be more accurate as well.
"I've had my Galaxy 4 watch for 6 months and it was generally working as expected. Then, my phone began having rapid battery drain in the last week, leading to the phone screen going haywire. My phone recovered once I deleted the Galaxy watch apps. I tried to reinstall the Samsung apps and the problems occurred again. Super disappointed!"
It count travelling in vehicle also as walk steps so i don't like it
"Latest update won't let me open the app until i agree to grant access to my phone. Not happening Samsung, and this is the last of your products i will be buying if you don't fix this. My phone call log is NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS and is not needed for the app to run. Shame on Google for allowing this app to be published. I can't stand the competition, but they are looking better in this regard. Edit - I am not granting access just to be able to open the app to contact you. Give your head a shake!"
"Absolutely the worst fitness app. Too bad I'd spent big monies for Samsung Watches (two of them) yet over the last few years, it's app is woefully inadequate. My sleeps are not properly recorded over and over (I can't wear the watch any tighter). I am seriously thinking about switching to competitive products."
"This is an edit to my 5 star review. The update killed this app. The weight management feature was key to my success. My original review was: ""Great, modern user interface. Has all the tools to help you track food, workouts, heart rate and more. I've lost 16 lbs so far in two months of using the app."""
"I have used this app for years and loved it. On my new S10 it would only work for a little while and then the oxygen reading would only show 70. After several phone calls with Samsung I ended up getting a new S10. To my surprise the same thing happened again. What I ended up figuring out is another app I use, My BP Lab (also associated with Samsung) was causing Samsung health to not work correctly. As long as you didn't use My BP Lab the health app worked correctly but if you used it once then the health app was messed up until you restarted the phone. Due to the connection between these two apps I would think that they should be able to work together."
i totally love it it encourages me to keep working out. and the one on one challenges are amazing although i previously won one challenge which was not updated. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS APP(initially) I wish you can control the nude pictures by participant no. 1 and no. 2. The nudity and ponographic materials are ruining this site. Am back to say thank you for removing them.
"It has been a few months since I last used this app. And it worked great, until recently. This app does not work now. It constantly tells me to properly place my finger over the light, over and over. Never had a problem til recently. Probably had something to do with their last update or something. Now this app is basically worthless, since the sensors arw not working properly. Will be seeking a different app, if possible. When you fix this, I may come back."
"When it works it great when it doesn't is useless. It's stopped syncing data to 'my fitness pal'. Come on Samsung get sorted you're fast going down hill Update: thanks for the reply 13/10/20, I wont be contacting u because u dont do anything when I do - been there got the t-shirt. It doesn't link with food intake either from 'my fitness pal' after uninstall & reinstall. I think samsung do this on purpose for some unknown stupid reason. You know these are issues but don't do anything to rectify"
The auto syncing feature absolutely destroys my battery life. I have to turn it off or else the battery drains way too fast. Please let the developers know that this needs to be fixed because it's completely unusable. It consumes more battery than all of my other apps combined.
"All of a sudden, starting on April 29th, no step counts from my Gear 2 watch are transferred to this app. The watch shows step activity but the health app shows 0 steps from the gear devices every day since. Also, if your app developers set out to make the most user unfriendly version of this app to date, congratulations! They've succeeded."
"I used this app for quite a while to track everything; my activity level, caloric intake, weight loss (and some weight gain), and vitamin and mineral levels. I feel that the app played a very crucial role in helping me lose over 60 pounds and keep it off. My only recommendation is that you should input the nutritional information for the foods you eat yourself instead of the information already in the app, and I think going through that process also helps you be moreaware of what you're eating."
"A lot of room to improve, like better graphics, blood pressure and glucose immediate chart result evaluation to understand what level of health you are, medication reminder and sickness history."
Love being able to keep track of everything on one app and having the Global Challenges is exciting when I'm in good enough health to get all the way through that months challenge!! The sleep pattern tracker though needs to be improved to better track sleeping quality because it doesn't even compare to the Fitbit sleep pattern tracker. But I love my Gear S2 way to much to go back to the Fitbit Ionic because had way to many issues with it! Also a barcode scanner would improve food logging.
"I'm glad I read the reviews before updating, and I checked with another friend who updated. He now literally ""flies"" the whole day with zero steps tracked, while I already have issues where if the app is not running in the foreground with the screen on, it would not track my steps. My phone runs Android Pie and the app is totally not ready to work on it. No wonder none of my Samsung using friends have received Android Pie. Compared data with Google Fit, steps are usually 4-5x lesser. Even my Xiaomi MiBand 2 is 80% close to Google Health for steps tracked."
"Update 15/12/2018: This app worked fine when I started using it. A month later, after a security software update, it won't open...apparently my device is rooted(NOT)! The OEM content team cannot help because they only deal with, you guessed it, content and apps. How shambolic!! Sort it out! After a recent security update from the OEM, this app claims it won't run on a rooted device. Funny!"
"Steps stop counting on my S10+ after a few weeks of use as well as 6 other family and friends who purchased same phone across different networks (T-Mobile, Verizon and ATT). Fix it. Update: Apparently happens when getting a call during exercise. It doesn't happen consistently...but often. I must be firmware/hardware issue as other Pedometer apps stop too."
I really really liked being able to track workouts and hikes. I will be uninstalling it now that it needs access to my phone to work properly. Edit: if it's really not used for anything then you should be able to rewrite the app code so it's not required. I'll await the removal of that requirement in the next update.
"Not so good after updated privacy notice. Now I can't get into the app. The Privacy Notice window pops up every time I try to open the app, and when I select ""accept"" another message pops up saying I need to allow permission in settings. There is no permission for it in settings that I can see."
"Edited to add: ever since the update, it doesn't track all of my steps or my exercise. There's definitely a glitch in it now It's a fine, well rounded app. I don't understand the ""weight management"" aspect though. A little more explanation on that would be helpful"
"Was a good app before the update. Can you provide an explaination other than ""Samsung Health requires phone permissions to provide a better overall service experience. Permissions is required to verify the unique device identifier for the together feature and it is not used for other purposes. Granting phone permission to Samsung Health is not intended for an actual phone call or for browsing call history. You didn't need access to contacts, camera, etc before and the app was great. why can't we deny permission and still get access to the app."
"Having recently been diagnosed with diabetes type 2 I have been using Samsung Health to monitor my calorific intake, exercise and weight and have found it very helpful in this regard. However might I make the following observations about the recent upgrade: The Weight Management section should have been retained; The line for speed and fill for altitude in the workout section were much clearer than fill for both; The multi-coloured bars in the Nutrient Intake summary were easier to read."
So tough get ot going again after an update that ruined it. Android is the worse always crashing nothing ever works such a waste of life
"Most of my issues with the Samsung Health deal with my Samsung Galaxy watch. The workouts randomly stop for no reason, its clumsy to navigate from the main watch screen to the workout and either the watch or the treadmill are way off in steps. I finish a 3 mile run, the treadmil shows 3 miles, the watch 4.87 miles? Also, the community challenge is useless, the fake accounts make it impossible to compete for a top stop. For example, the #1 person has avg 47 miles a day for the entire month?!?"
"it keeps shutting off by itself??? very annoyed as it doesnt track my steps and just disappears from my notification bar automatically. edit : i tried the method they suggested but it doesnt work. also, now, even when the app is open and on the notification bar, it doesnt even track steps anymore. i should have walked about 14k but this app only tracked 1k."
"I am in agreement with katlyn and several other recent reviews that feel absolutely cheated that the features I used to brag about when it came to this app - heart, stress, etc. Poof! disappeared without any notification. I have waited this long wondering if a patch would come thru and it has been A Long Time. i will not be buying any gear as it is obvious that my favorite features are now moving in that direction. A real mistake. please advise more specifically about upcoming update regards."
Not including the ECG function. ECG app won't work on non Samsung phones. So many apps to install to use my Samsung watch...
"Fantastic app. I'm one of those old school users that just use their phone for calls, texts, the occaisional web search, navigation & a couple of handy apps such as samsung tv remote. This app has me using my phones bells & whistles like no other! 5 stars if the widget had a pause button for the pedometer! Samsung PLEASE add this feature it will make step counting much more accurate, I know you can go into the app to do this but was suprised to see this feature not on the widget!"
"I am using the app since last couple of years, but since 2 weeks when i start my walk as soon my screen goes off, it's states works has paused, while i am walking. It's working fine after support from Samsung Health. It's my setting that i had put the app on sleep as soon as i leave the app, so as soon the screen goes off the app put the workout on pause. Now all is good after removal of app from battery saving mode not to sleep in background."
I am very unhappy with the last update that got rid of the oxygen saturation tool. As someone who suffers from a lung disorder (cystic fibrosis) I actually used it quite often as part of my tools to see where my health is sitting at. It may not have been perfectly accurate but it was better then nothing to see a baseline. It was my major reason for use of this app. to give my doctors some readings while I was at home trying to get healthy enough to avoid a hospital stay. Please bring it back.
Why did I waste $500 on a Galaxy Watch 4 when it can't autodetect bike rides like the $40 used Fit 2 Pro I had could?
"Absolutely the easiest and best app I have ever used for tracking my daily health trends and needs. I love that it gauges my essential nutrients intake. That is so important and helpful to me! If they could add more nutrients to the list that would be awesome, but I'm happy with it as-is too."
Very unhappy with the latest update. I had been using the app for a year locally on my phone with no account or sync to their cloud. After the app updated I was lokcked out of the app andy data.. I was forced to create an account and provide access to personal info and phone access just to be able to get back to my year worth of data. Samsung held my personal health data hostage in order to force me to sign up and provide even more personal data
"This has been a useful servant for the past year or so, but this redesign is a big no-no for myself. Seems like you've taken alot away for an over-simplified design - for example, how come I can't view workouts older than 30 days any more? Ironically I was trying to get them so I could import them into Strava (which I probably won't be able to do). Le sigh."
"I was using the pedometer on this app but just had to uninstall. The app was disrupting my day repeatedly with a noisy women's voice droning on. Addendum. I tried reinstalling to see if the glitch had been corrected. Received input that in order to access, I need to relinquish control over my phone to a bunch of strangers. This is for my benefit? I don't think so. Sayonara!"
Maybe I'll get a response here. My Samsung s8 had a system update yesterday and for some reason it broke my app. It says access denied and to contact customer service. I've contacted them twice and each time the call cuts off. I love this app but it won't work anymore. I'll update the rating when I get a response from Samsung directly on how to fix this
"Good App for tracking health and some activities, especially if you have a Samsung watch, however the latest update has a bug where the Steps notification is stuck in the notification bar and cannot be removed and keeps coming back (if you disable and reenable Step Notifications) Please fix as the only option is to disable the Steps Notification in the UI which is not great. This happens on a Note 9 but not a S5 so might be a OS /UI bug."
It does what it says but it's a samsung product so it's only a matter of time before they start removing features just like the active blood pressure monitoring. My watch had it literally a week ago when I bought it 1 update later and that feature is just gone not even accessible on the watch that set it up. So while I'd like to give it a better review seems like they don't understand the star rating system and any time over 3 stars causes them to think its OK to screw with it so 2 stars max
It worked well when I had my Note9. Since upgrading to S22+ the sleep monitoring doesn't work. Read many others that have the same issue. I've tried all the troubleshooting. You guys need to fix that issue. Not impressed. Can someone email me please? I have tried to send an email as suggested.
The app is good overall. The track my period is a great feature. I love that it tracks my steps autimatically. I miss the beginner 5k and beginner 10k program. I ran my first 5k with the help of the program and am ready to move on to the 10k but it's gone. I prefer a more structured program to help me stay on track. What happened? Why is that feature gone? Is it coming back? Wait I just realized that there is still a picture of the programs section. My program section is gone
"I downloaded this app to measure my O2 sat levels. Really garbage. I keep my finger in the middle of the sensor, but eah time while measuring it will make sure your finger is in the middle of the sensor. I also find it highly unreliable. For example, this morning I checked my levels. Hadnt exerted myself. After dealing with the same bs for nearly 5 minutes it gave me a reading of 70%. 10 minutes later it said 96%."
Won't sync with Qantas well being all of a sudden
"Where did the maps go? I used to be able to track a walk or hike and it would give me a map of my path. I miss this soooo much. Ok. Looks like the msos are back. I do miss having the app count my stair steps. It had not done that tracking for a while. My watch still does, but the app does not log it."
"Great app to track and assist in achieving my fitness goals. However, it could get much better if they added a ""Nap"" section with the amount of calories we burn while napping. Also, vitamin B intakes to be counted when one registers the food if not listed. This app is not very accurate in counting ""Dietary Fiber"" which will always result in our deficit. Potassium & magnesium & vitamin D are vital daily intakes that we need to tick off using this app."
"I enjoy using the app, especially the challenge feature. I check in every day to see how far I have walked and if I earned any points. I have not been able to take advantage of the full experience of the app e.g. the suggested at home exercise. But that's on me not making time to do them."
"Please let people see their totals for the week and month, not the average. Who the heck even uses average steps? We want to see total steps. Newest update doesn't have an opacity slider on the widget which is super frustrating. Edit: distance tracker took a nose dive as well, I've walked 5 miles and the app is only recording 3.8"
I wish that it still had some of the functionality that over time have phased out. Still decent for keeping track of personal stats. One thing I wish would be added is web export capability. It would be nice to transfer stats to other devices or apps I use that this app does not link with.
"I use this app with a galaxy s20+ and a galaxy watch3. The calorie counting functionality is terrible and is off by hundreds of calories vs. simultaneous comparisons to Peloton or Polar apps or online calculators using same inputs. Good news is the watch3 heartbeat monitor tracks very closely to that of a Polar chest sensor; however, if this is a 'simple' software algorithm issue repeatedly called out since 2019, why hasn't Samsung fixed it?"
[Update: one extra star for the fast response. Problem still unsolved though ): ] This used to be a good app (therefore the second star) but for about 1 week steps are only counted sporadically... I have several pedometers installed; after 2 hours of walking all say something between 12k and 13k steps... But Samsung health is at 5k only... This happens regularly and is especially annoying when you are in the middle of a challenge. I changed no options & app has full permissions. Please fix!
"Bugs since last update not counting steps/distance/calories or sleep consistently. Apparently after a run around my local park I achieved 29 steps when I was expecting 7k. The app used to count everything behind the scenes, now I have to have it open to consistently count. Tried the fix you gave and no dice. I'm in NZ so won't be calling international number."
I love my Samsung Gear. I have the first one and it does what I need it to do. I will eventually update to the pro version. Above is my last experience with gear fit. Now I've started having problens with the app. It keeps shutting down and stopping. Had to Uninstall and reinstall. Guess what I've lost everything! Come on Samsung make a product that works! Your customer service i would give a D- too because all they want to do is tell you to buy another of your products.
Great app until they moved floors to a sub menu under steps. Please put it back on main page. Plenty of room there. Or five us the option to add/remove. This is certainly a down grade for my usage. Now distance is on a sub-menu too. This is another downgrade of the app. What were you thinking moving distance and steps to a submenu?
Two things I would like to see changed is to be able to photo bar codes of foods that are not listed and have the data populated automatically and the blatant cheating on the challenges. Two to three million steps in a couple of days? Really? Not at all possible. Other than that I am happy with the app
"The app worked great to monitor heart beat and oxygen level. That was until 3/14/2020. I got a new privacy notice this morning and I clicked on it. Now as soon as I put my finger on the sensor the app crashes. What was changed in the app? 3/18/20 - still doesn't work. At a time when people need to monitor their health and be more vigilant, not having the blood oxygen feature is not good. This needs to be given the highest priority to get it fixed."
I was really excited to use this with my Samsung fit e. BUT. The step counter is way off (saying that I have walked way farther than i have walked) and there is no way to reset the counter so it is more accurate. It does not indicate the sleep stages as does the Fitbit and other similar devices. The info that I get on the app regarding my sleep is useless. It does not indicate REM sleep & indicates that I am in a deep sleep (motionless) when lying in bed reading or watching tv. Not worth it.
"I used this app every day. Then with no warning their changes forced you to give permissions for access to contacts, phone data etc etc. So overnight not able to access all my fitness and health records which for me with a health issue were super important. Not only will I not be using the app but I won't be buying another Samsung phone. If they can lock me out of my own account on the app who knows what they decide to do with my phone one day."
I have been using this app for quite awhile and enjoy it but just recently they are making me give permission to be in control of my calls and contacts and files. There is absolutely no reason why this is needed to a fitness app. Just another thing Samsung has made me do in order to keep certain features. Don't even get me started on my music files. Highly doubt I'll get a Samsung next time either.
Extremely disappointed that this requires phone permission to read phone number and it is not optional. If I deny the permission at login/setup it won't let me continue and says I need to enable the setting in permissions. This should be an optional permission at best. I don't have a smart watch and have no intention of getting one or using the health app for connecting with contacts or friends.
"I used to love love the app. I was able to choose other than whole or half servings. When I had to adjust the calorie count or serving size, now you can't. Has the same food with several different calorie counts which makes it difficult and time consuming."
It can be a useful app but A) it has no mute setting and will NOT shut up. I complained in the past and Samsung said to just disable the app entirely. B) it will sometimes not die. Phone said app was not on but battery was draining. Battery app showed this used 30% since last charge. Was also getting random audio notices from it. Perhaps the best thing is to just do like Samsung said and disable it.
"All of a sudden I need to setup 2step verification. Do it and it will not go past that screen so am unable to use this app anymore. I did all that you have responded with.. and after getting the text message and verifying the code, only get put back to the same screen to setup 2 step verification....it doesn't work."
Upgraded watch means down grading features...very disappointed. Upgraded to Watch 3 from Active 2 and so many features have been lost. I loved this app on the Active 2...hate it with the Watch 3. Thinking about returning the Watch 3 because of it. UPDATE 12/19/2020 - all apps eventually updated bringing back the functionality I fell in love with! Rating changed from 1 to 5. Thanks Samsung. PS: hope we see the blood pressure feature someday soon.
"I really love this app very much!!! I would like to make a suggestion though; in the breathing exercises, can you add some seconds to hold your breath in between (I mean if someone would like to do it) I've read it's really important to hold your breath some seconds to to relax more and oxygenate your body. Also, could you create a shortcut to the breathing exercises as well? It would be really really useful, too."
Update Now it's saying it's incomparable w all items. I have a galaxy 4 classic watch & an Android phone. Samsung won't allow me to use the ecg/AFib part of my watch. Why not? I bought the watch. I drop my phone a lot. Android is rugged to outlast my constant clumsiness. Why won't Samsung allow me to use my watch w all the bells and whistles... ridiculous
"I really appreciate this app. It's finally got me logging my diet, and it helps me keep track of my activity levels. Occasionally the food log will glitch during input and I have to re-add something to my meal, but other than that I haven't encountered any problems. The weekly summaries are actually really insightful and thorough. I'd love it if I could log other things from my day, like misc. health events - even a daily notes feature would work... but maybe that's beyond the scope of this app."
"App won't load. Unusable. I just want to be able to access data on my watch and this process is ridiculous. Create an account, allow phone access, enable 2 factor........oh, now that you've done all that the app is going to perpetually crash. This watch is a waste of time."
"I used to use this app regularly -- but mostly to keep track of steps taken and miles walked during exercise. (I was not really interested in recording other things, like food intake and sleep.) Suddenly, after buying a new phone a year or two ago, I was getting only steps taken. The app would not show me miles walked, or anything else, unless I created a Samsung account. No, thanks. I don't need or want any more data collection. This app is now practically useless for my purposes."
Best fitness app of all fitness apps
In general monitoring with Samsung watch 3 is ok. But it lacks the most important feature : knowledge user. It cant be ignored. Why not automatically restarting to monitore after a pause. It's silly to pretend that during exercise to have to press ‚Üò a bottom. Also the cardio monitoring & BP requires better fnishing and better information while in route. This cment is reated to the watch though it is not so clever carry a mobile and for that reason Samsung produces digital monitoring watches!
"edit: I to contact?! What is Your job then?! To copy paste the same message?! It is easier for me to find other apps then to contact.----sleep doesn't detect when I wake up well. If I turn off screen and make few steps that is enough to detect I don't sleep anymore-----You must add to remove ""friends"" becouse not every contact is friend. I don't want to block it"
"Where is the step goal, counting, in the notification menu, it says Samsung Helath startred???"
"New version is a step backwards (count THAT!). Prior version had no problems. New version is locked on ""dark mode"" with no ability to select white/day mode. Can't see elevations in dark mode...worthless. But...seems to be accurate on runs and distances."
Edit* - after multiple attempts with changing the settings I've finally reinstalled this app which fixed below issue. Only 2 starts as new update removed history view which was very useful plus app support very poor. Have to resolve a problem on my own. No idea what happened but since last update my workouts (while I'm running) are automatically pausing (despite the fact I'm still on the move) and do not resume.... any reason for it and most important any resolution please?
"Expected much greater functionality. For example, a better graph to track body weight changes. Also, a way to crop down a run. As in if you jump in a car and forget to stop the run the distance doesn't stop tracking."
Originally it instantly closed as soon as i pressed the 'Together' link but now the app crashes as soon as it opens. Shame as i have been using it for several weeks to track my progress. It doesn't have any outstanding updates it has just stopped working.
Your excuse for demanding phone call and contact permissions on my device is unacceptable and deplorable. I hope who ever thought that was a good idea is fired. I see it just updated again it's still asking for my phone and contact info. I will not recommend the app to anyone. For those of you who feel the same way Pedometer Step Counter is a good alternative that's doesn't require invasive permissions. Heart Rate Plus is great for checking heart rate or pulse. Also doesn't require too much....
"I relied on this app as an alternative to my fitness pal for nutrition and macro tracking but since it's been updated you can't see how much protein, carbs and fat you've eaten. The app also removed the 2 snack meals and combined them into 1 which is very frustrating. Why change something that isn't broke? Just messed up a perfectly good app"
"Right now (as of 2 days ago) it won't communicate with MFP rendering it basically useless to me. I emailed the developers and if they can solve i would certainly update my rating but now this is just bloatware on my Note 9. Update: the email address provided below is useless...it's a no-reply address. Wishing for zero star rating. And Samsung if you're watching, both apps have been reinstalled multiple times since this happened so I am on the latest version on my Note 9."
"I really like the food diary portion. Simple to find fresh as well as purchased items. Love the nutritional breakdown. Would be a complete app for me if I could share not only the trends, but the micro level of what I ate each day to correlate with glucose levels traced on another app."
Very good app but food logging is not good. Very less indian food varieties. It's not sync with other app for food log
The app could really do with a better widget that would allow you to see your data at a glance rather than going into the app. Some activities don't sync correctly with other services either. It's okay but as Samsung spend so much time promoting the galaxy watch they should probably spend some of that time improving the app that goes alongside it
"The app promps you to ""check out OPTIONS"" #1. Is to ""Get Notifications for Samsung Health Promotions & Marking Information"" and early says in parentheses (Optional) #2. ""Automatically Sync Data to Samsung Account"" and again says clearly in parentheses (Optional). I don't want either, so I try to tap NEXT and it doesn't allow me to continue using the ap without 1st accepting one of their Optional Options. Which I do not want. As a result I am going to discontinue using this app."
It was working well until recently. Now it keeps sending me to settings to fix something but I don't know what needs fixing. Tried a fresh install and the app requested permission to access contacts which I denied. I cannot go further. I am not sharing my information with friends so no reason for that to be mandatory unless your using it socially. Change the strict permissions and I will reinstall.
The app just keeps losing GPS signal every time I use it. My last 24km run indicated by the app was supposed to be 1.5km to 2km longer. I keep the phone strapped on my hand with no signal obstruction but this makes no difference. I will consider another app for running as I am training for a full marathon and faults like this are no good at all.
"Before the July update, step counting and cycling app was brilliant for counting steps and recording distance cycled. Since 6 july it's been rubbish, pausing walks and cycling and not giving the accurate distance. Will now be looking for another app to do this. It's a shame as it worked great till then. Other users have stated same problem with Samsung answer to clear cache etc...all this done but no difference."
"This is one of the best app provided in Samsung devices. It works well with the gear 2. Steps are accurately counted. I can now be able to track my caffeine, food,water intake. It is fun to join the challenges. The new updated look of the app looks more better than its previous version. I just love it ‚ô•Ô∏è"
"Been trying to install, always getting 0x2a#0 error for my samsung note, i wish to connect my galaxy watch but getting error for the last 4 days"
"After the update, I can no longer check stress levels or oxygen saturation using the sensor on the back of my note 8. I get a straight line, then it tells me to position my finger correctly. My finger is positioned correctly and still nothing. Please fix. Thanks."
"Meh. Not easy to personalize. Not sure where to add my weight, how to adjust food portions etc. Seems way too general to be worth the effort of adding information daily. If all this is accessible, it's not intuitive and I don't want to take all afternoon to learn to use an app."
"Good app, but I wish it was more customizable. I use the cycling feature on this app to track my rides, check my speed, and distance. I use a few accessories speed, cadence sensor, and a heart rate monitor. Unfortunately I can't seem to get rid of the avg. Cadence and avg heart rate readings from my display screen. I would like to see some other data that is important to me while riding that those panels take space from. I was hoping with a bigger phone I would at least get an extra two panels."
"it has bene 3 months since I can open the app. First I got a message about rooted and now I get a message about unauthorised changes, I can't go any further and after about 30 seconds of the message the app closes. I have deleted and redownloaded a dozen times and nothing. The app is completely useless"
"I use Samsung Health with my Galaxy Watch, and like it, but it needs improvements. First, I'd like taiji as a workout type. I also use it to track swimming and would like it to notice when I'm resting and not count it against my length time. Also, it consistently overcounts how far I've swum by 2-3 lengths over a 50-70 length workout. I'm not switching direction or doing anything different. Finally, it thinks I'm bicycling when I'm mowing the lawn. Seems like those two are easy to differentiate."
Won't sign in on oneplus7tpro want to use it with my gear fit 2. Despite multiple attempt s with 2 step verification the sign in circle just spins and nothing happens. Just to verify made a new account still can't sign in app not working at all. Poor.. unhappy. Hi still does not work. Tried deleting app data aswell. Once verification is done noting happens just spins.
"Now with the new 2 step authentication, samsung has made this app unusable. I followed the steps to comply and even received the verification code but unfortunately the 6-digit code used was not recognised to be submitted. Actually, spamming the numbers to see the minimum number of characters didn't even enable the verify button so there's definitely a bug there."
"Very, very inaccurate at calculating calorie burn. It doesn't even calculate based on heart rate, just some simple algorithm, which given the Galaxy watch was ¬£300+ when I first bought it, makes it a very expensive time piece, as it cannot be relied upon for health tracking. Sometimes it's really quite demoralising!"
"Excellent app, however since last update there's a problem with it not showing the recommended nutrient intake properly (everything is set to 0). Cleaning the cache temporarily solves the issue, but the issue keeps coming back. I primarily use the app to track my food intake so it would be nice if that problem could be fixed."
"I used to use this app and didn't really care for it it was quite some time ago. But there were better ones ...after researching for getting a new smartwatch/fitnesswatch, I was actually going to change from the Fitbit to the Samsung active two LTE but after reading all these reviews about the app it's not any better if not worse. After two weeks of so much research I thought I found the one. Does anyone know if Samsung is going to fix the situation. Is there a way to uninstall all those update?"
"I've been using this app for over a year since I got my Samsung device. It was pretty accurate and one of the best health apps ever. However, I've been facing this issue since the latest update and the problem is that step counter only works when my phone is unlocked. I checked the settings and I gave permission for the app to run in the background even when the phone is locked. I still give this app 5 starts but I hope you fix this issue soon. Have a great day."
"Recently downloaded this onto my Huawei P30 Pro... Have been unable to sign into the app at all, it just keeps spinning on the screen after logging in. Having done a quick Google seems to be an issue when you try to use the app on a device that isn't a Samsung. Tried the fixes that are reccommended and this had no luck."
"Getting less useful with every iteration - so many useful monthly and average metrics have disappeared and this app is getting less useful with every update. The latest removes activity time being able to be viewed weekly or monthly averages. Basically they have removed all the average metrics completely and you can only view per day which is useless for tracking trends. Absolutely hopeless and very, very disappointing. The last straw for me, leaving Samsung after many years. It used to be good!"
"Not work properly, not sync with Google fit and not connecting with fossil watch."
"It's ok. The add food section could use a better layout. Since I cook most of my my meals it would be good if foods were listed instead of having a brand behind it. Example: quinoa burgers. Yes, it would be hard to know the exact calories but we'll have an idea of calorie counting still."
It was exceptionally good health monitoring app and i was extremely satisfied by it!!! UNTILL the last BS update happened on 8th! ....this update made it least useful! Also....app keeps on crashing and hanging every time i try to open. Sometimes it froze my phone so had to restart!!! No function/option of this updated version works properly without hanging or crashing! Please patch back to reverse or make changes as early as possible! otherwise i dnt see any reason of keeping this app anymore!
"I love my galaxy active watch but I ended up uninstalling the samsung health app from my phone. I have a backup that I might install it on but the software was constantly sending notifications even when I set them all to no. I only want the software to give me information when I ask for it. The first several weeks were good but then I guess there was an update and after that I'd have to hit ""force stop"" roughly every 20 minutes. I'll watch the reviews, or just load the app every now and again, see if things get back to the old way."
"This app most certainly makes me more aware of how much I have.. Or usually haven't walked. I love the challenges. I don't ever try to best anyone else other than myself. I just wish it would give me a reminder to walk more.. If that is a feature I just haven't found it yet. I also like that I can track my weight, meals and workouts."
Used mainly for the calorie and weight tracking. I really wish there was a way to record meals for the next day because I like to plan ahead if I am traveling. Other apps (fatsecret) let you do this. Seems like a simple revision. Would rate 5 starts if you could record meals a day ahead.
"I have OnePlus 8T and I just got brand new Galaxy Fit2 and I need this app. But the app isn't working. It asks username and password and then it just loads and loads. Nothing happens. I can sign in with a browser though. My help request didn't reach you for some reason. I sent a question through the form, but then nothing. The service doesn't show that I even sent anything. If I cannot get this working, I have to find and buy other tracker from other manufacturer."
"I use this all the time and I've watched my calories, active minutes, steps and burned calories to lose 30 lbs over summer with minimum effort. I do miss the weight management option though, so they lose a star until they bring it back or substitute it. Great app otherwise üëç"
"Won't open after latest update. Advice from Samsung to clear cache, etc didn't work- does it ever?! I didn't want to make an international call to the US to discuss the issue. So I uninstalled all updates and updated again, it works fine now. After all that I still prefer the previous version! I have given up on ""together"" due to permissions and people clearly cheating. Also I stopped monitoring my sleep patterns which is very liberating!"
"I like the app, use it for walking and jogging mostly. Recently has started using workouts and joined a global challenge but unfortunately the second day it shows me the msg unable to connection to network or request failed. It is very frustrating. I tried different wifi and mobile connections. The msg is still the same. Could you please solve the issue or advice me what can be done. Thank you."
"Crashes constantly on my brand new Oppo find X2 pro. Each time I launch it, it quits. Maybe 1 time out of 20 it will allow me to access my galaxy watch info for sleep, for example. Everything else works perfectly on my phone. Very frustrating when i have a brand new galaxy watch 3. Looks like I might have to sell it and get something more reliable / less buggy. Update 2: Spent 1 hour on a support live chat with Samsung without success. Asked to leave bug report as the outcome.üòü"
"Hey Samsung! the app is very nice and usefull but now it became laggy. I am using Note 9, so I would expect that there would be no lags, especially when I select food items in the log. to just simply add food from the list takes a second or two. it was not like that a month ago. Fix it, please!"
"First, I must say that I love my new Samsung Active 2 watch. However, the Samsung Health app leaves a little to be desired since I just left Fitbit after many years of use. There's 3 things that Fitbit does well with it's app that I would LOVE to see in the Samsung Health app. 1) Creating a weight loss plan and tracking my progress. 2) Must be able to scan food barcodes. 3) Choose food serving size by quantity not just a slider scale by calories. Please don't tell us to contact you, just fix it"
"It's a good overall app however the constent try taking a walk notifications (that for the life of me I can't figure out how to tern off, although to be fair that's probably a me problem) are infuriating. Mostly because I can't. I'm a wheelchair user. I cant ever ""try taking a walk"", I cant walk. I dont relly want to be reminded if that every time I open my phone. It would be great if it could track distance instead that way more people could enjoy it."
Newest version doesn't recognize heart rate sensor on Note 9. What is the point of having a sensor if it can't be used? Samsung health doesn't even give the option to add stress test or heart rate. Way to go samsung just gut the app and encourage all those users to buy a new phone. I bought this phone because it could read a heart rate and SpO2 which you advertised as a feature. That's a breach of an undisclaimable express warranty. I didn't get what I paid for.
"I love this app, but I wish I could change the language, regardless of the language my phone is using. Because I'm in Brazil and my phone is set up in English, but I can't find Brazilian food to track my food. Can you fix it? Perhaps using location or something similar to suggest food that can be purchased in some region or just offering the option of using this app in another language. Thanks!"
"The app hasn't worked in months. First it was a ""rooted"" phone error. I don't have a rooted phone. Now it says ""unauthorized changes were made to my phone."" after the latest update on 06.28.19. I have a Samsung watch and would love to use the app. UPDATE: STILL NO RESOLUTION. Called tech, they couldn't figure it out. Was told they would escalate and call me back...that was last week."
"The software is TERRIBLE!! Compared to the others this software is lacking. Difficult to enter information manually and not easy to work with. I could go on and on but I'm really disappointed with the software. Here in Korea all tips, advice are in Korean and not the language of the phone. WAKE UP!! GET PROFESSIONAL WITH THE SOFTWARE!! I'll never buy another Samsung Smart watch!!"
"8/30/2021 - they fixed this and then broke it again! Deleted my data before 2019! They also changed the way data is viewed by autofilling in days with no data. I really don't like this. Maybe allow people to change this in display settings but not by default! 3/20/2021 - still no fix 2/19/2021 - Changed the interface, now you can't easily view graphs/averages in weight change over time. Samsung says to keep the recent version for updates! Stop telling us to update to more BS!"
"I love using this app with my Samsung Galaxy watch, it does almost everything I need, there's only one very simple thing that I wish it would do and it would make it the most awesome app out there. if any of the developers see this, please add the option to simply add pushup reps, I do 25 pushups every hour on the hour and there's no option to track that unless I manually enter the reps. I wish there was a way to hit start on the watch, knock'em out, hit stop and be able to track the reps."
"Still not happy that the old calorie meter has not been restored, but now with the last update the App seems to have lost the ability to monitor sleep I see total time but no breakdown of sleep stages like before the last update. Is this a known issue and are there any corrective actions that can be taken?"
"I'll wait a bit for updates and if nothing corrected, I'll delete it as it wants toooo much. I can't let my fitness app to obtain the permission to manage my phone calls for whatever reason it wants it. I don't plan to use it for any phone calls and messages. Used to use it, have connected watch but sincerely it's too much."
"This app has been extremely good and useful but since the last update I am no longer able to see how many steps I have walked since I started using the app. For the last few years I have set myself a target of 4,000,000 steps per year (which I invariably exceed) however, I am now suddenly deprived of the ability to see these stats. This is most disappointing. Can you please explain why you appear to have done away with this highly useful and motivational feature of the app?"
"I've seen the replies from the developer but it seems feeble. You're asking for access to my phone calls to be able to open the app. It's a no from me. Do everyone a favour (yourselves included) and roll it back and think again. You want to offer a ""better experience"" but let us opt in for the extras rather than make it all or nothing."
Good service with gr8 features.
"The app was awesome before the latest update (6.11) when they removed the weight management. Without this feature it just don't work for me anymore. Hope the Product Owners do something about. - Update: almost 1 year since the removal of weight management and all we got is ""we will inform the developers"", nice to see the user feedback means nothing, really considering upgrade to another brand."
Records steps you never took. Calculates distance by guesswork. Cant put in stride length. I can be driving and it will count many steps. Still needs improvement. Might be useful to pause step count using phone buttons.
When I haven't moved my phone for a while or have other apps running and haven't moved. It doesn't record my steps. I have to go into the app turn off step country and turn it back on again to get it going. then you try to send a message to developer through Google Play and it's a no reply email address. Thanks for the customer support and again I live in Australia I'm not calling internationally.
"I rated this app 5 stars a couple years ago and am now dropping it down to 2. There are so many useless updates that rework the UI for no reason, sometimes making it actually harder to do certain things. I wish Samsung would stop fiddling with the way it looks and start fixing some of its underlying issues."
"Not very accurate with steps. Half the time it doesn't count steps. Other times, it won't work"
"Completely inaccurate. I run the same distance on the same track every day. Somehow, my fastest time doing this was counted as walking... I check the distance, off by half a mile. Calories also wildly off. Was pretty happy with this app until I realized it's completely inaccurate. Doesn't track anything correctly."
"Nüí•ce ü§úü§õ I see it got improved .. good GPS! The app is good in running, walking and cycling but not useful for swimming activities üôÑ"
"Since using this app counting calories has never been easier they have a large variety of foods (restaurants included) and constantly updating it. I have two friends who have Samsung and started using the app and we constantly challenge each other which keeps us well worked out, would highly recommend for beginners an advance users."
"Switching to another tracker when my Watch dies, I've have had enough of Samsung Health, it just keeps getting worse!"
"Latest update says it needs permission to manage calls and messages. Really? They worked before just fine. Stop with overreach. I am switching to a wear os based device. And don't tell me you don't share the information....it says so in the policy where everything is vague enough to allow information you gather to be shared with any ""relevant"" 3rd party. It's bogus."
shealth is the best health app on the market. you can track your fitness and goals but more importantly for me I'm able to keep a detailed record of my vitals. i still use the app on a pixel a year after switching off Samsung. i would want a feature to report/block bad nutrition info from the searches. a lot of people dont track everything and i dont like seeing those pop up.
"It was great at first then over the years and months it has been less helpful and more intrusive. The last straw was the app HAVING to HAVE access to my contacts and call logs in order for me to simply OPERATE the app. Regardless of you all wanting to ""enhance my experience"" I am happy with my CURRENT experience; this is crossing the line and intrusive. Deleted the app and all files I could find. I hope the waves of Uninstalls reach epic proportion. Take care."
"The new update got rid of the weight management portion, which was very useful in helping meet weight goals. Pretty unfortunate, since that was one of the best parts about it. I read that MyFitnessPal may be a suitable alternative, so I'll switch to that for the time being."
"This application has improved a lot since my original rating, so I only felt that I should rate again. Everything is working very well now and things are clearer to understand with the nice clean UI. Now using this with my Samsung Galaxy S9 Plus and my Samsung Galaxy Watch 46mm LTE and it is the perfect combination to get the most out of this application. Thanks for the continued hard work to make sure this is one of the best fitness/health application's available."
"I do not like that I am forced to sign up with an email, I do not like that even after I signed up they require my phone number and text verification, and after all of that bull, I absolutely despise having to agree for them to only open the app if I ""agree to let them make and manage my phone calls""?! Wth. This app use to be awesome. I didn't have to sign up to open it, it was just with my phone when I got it. I am deleting this app and never using it again unless they change it back to simple."
"Was absolutely fine until this last update. Now the app is abhorrent in its appearance and cannot be altered. So many features I used to use are gone, only to be replaced with meaningless graphics and surprise surprise more space for adverts. I wish I had never updated."
"Comes preloaded on many Samsung's devices, but do not let if fool you, for it is a very powerful health companion. Still, it lacks some useful items and it does not let you manually insert them, like temperature, body composition or moods. It does the job with weight, blood pressure, blood glucose, heart rate, sleep, activities, food, water and caffeine logs. Recently, Samsung disabled O¬≤ track for galaxy active watch, which isn't nice. Everything else in the app keep getting updates."
I would love to give this app 5 stars but it is missing two things in my opinion. It should be easier to enter your portions. I instead have to constantly read the back of products or look online for what one serving is or what so many grams of each food looks like. Id like to just be able to enter half of a cup or one tablespoon. And it needs a caloric deficit counter. If im burning more calories than im eating this app should be able to tell you. Also cant see my sleep factors? Wierd.
"Dear software developers, I would like to see in your program a reminder and an addition about taking pills. Thanksüòäüòäüòä"
"App is completely broken with the latest update. It requires me to enable 2FA in order to continue but it doesn't actually work. It sends me the code, I enter it, but the ""Enter"" button is greyed out and there is nothing I can do to get past it. I tried clearing cache and data, reinstalling, nothing works. The app is useless as is. Using a OP8 5G. Response: My problem is not that I don't like the 2FA, it is that it is broken. I literally, can't enable it because the app is broken."
it's a very clean app with lots of functionalities. much better than Fitbit. however it will be even better if two more features can be included 1. Challenge multiple friends instead of just one on one Challenge 2. separate function for Breathe exercise (at the moment I have check my stress levels to practice breathing exercises)
"It was my favorite app. Until it started to request an access to contacts and phone calls. The answers below don't make much sense. The permissions are ""only used to create optimal experience""? Well, it was optimal before you implemented them. You are also offering ""help"" when none other is needed except removal of ridiculous requests, who thought that it's a good way to answer customers? üòÖ"
"Overall I enjoy the app and it's features. The Together section is quite fun with all the challenges, very entertaining. However I wish there was a feature that your could review your own, as well as friends' stats ie most steps walked, best workout time/calories burned etc and compare and/or share to social media. Otherwise so far so good."
"Latest update removed the best feature - a simple, clear, small, transparent widget showing steps on the home screen. Now they have a fancy white-background larger widget which looks like a Google wannabe and doesn't fit nicely on my home screen. Such a silly decision, thinking of uninstalling and replacing with a different step counter app."
"Update 5/26/2020 So that problem got fixed and was very happy with the app again until recently when it started not properly recording my calories burned. Either too high or too low (ie 54 calories burned for a 5 mile run, and 1770 burned for 2000 steps). I wish they would get this app back on track. I was told it was a bug within the update but its been a month already. Also, now it won't track my miles properly either. Furthermore, I connected it to myfitnesspal and it messed up my macro goals"
I guess I'm a sack of potatoes I downloaded the Samsung health app I clicked on the heart I still haven't located The blood pressure MonitorThis is ridiculous The reason I purchased this watch was so that I can manage my blood pressure when I'm not at home
"This App used to be really good. Then, Samsung started removing one thing after the other and basically all I am left with now is an expensive watch that counts how many paces I do in a day. I only bought the Samsung Galaxy Watch Active 2 (less than a month ago), because it had functions like weight and calorie control, now after the last update that is all gone! Very dissappointed and in theory I should send the watch back because it is no longer the same watch that I bought about 3 weeks ago!"
Samsung removed the blood oxygen tab which is the only tab I use. It's still listed as a feature though. Their canned response of clearing cache and rebooting fixes nothing. EDIT: That doesn't fix anything. The spO2 item is gone from the app. I got it back after reverting to an older version. Will adjust rating if fixed.
"The detect workout function is switched off on my phone, has been so for months yet I get daily notifications of me meeting or exceeding daily steps. I often get that notification after stepping out of a vehicle I've been riding in and or driving to work going at or above 50km/h for 2 hrs. Notified app developers about issue their suggestions didn't help."
"Used to be very good but the recent update removed really basic things that were actually useful like the calorie counter keeping track of when I've gone too high and need to burn away calories. Also what happened to ""Other workouts""? it now brings me to an overview instead of letting me use it to measure exercises that arent kept in the app like Dips and windmills. I might aswell just use a stop watch and notebook instead of this app, works the same since the convenient features were removed."
"I've used it for over 3 years for diet tracking. I used to be able to log 6 meals a day (3 meals and 3 snacks). Now they dropped it to 3 meals and 1 snack. Not very useful unless there is an update soon, otherwise I'll be switching."
"Edit: now your app sucks even more. It requires two step verification, but it won't allow me to set it up. Had to re-install it to make it work. A big company, unable to make changes that actually work?? Nasty company limiting the use of some of the features on their watches with their own phones only. This app is the only thing available for non-Samsung phone and blood pressure monitoring is not available here."
"Body composition no longer works whether I manually input weight through the app or measure body composition through my watch 4. It shows you the weight from outside but once you enter, it doesn't show anything like body fat, skeletal muscle, etc even though this data appears on the watch (unlike before)"
"App worked great for about six months. Out of the blue it went wonky. The steps are more than my fit2 and if I try to have it only use my band, it says zero. The sleep function is useless now. It will give me a general timeframe of my sleep and ask me to verify it... then it's a solid line depicting my sleep pattern as opposed to showing and calculating all the time I was awake, etc. I have uninstalled numerous times and made sure all updates are done. Makes me want to buy a different brand."
Loved b4 newest update. They changed format and took away the total counts for your daily macros. It still shows percentages but i miss the total grams. Please add back in on next update. Also the dashboard is very slow to update and sometimes shows inaccurate amounts on calories. UPDATE- thank you thank you... they added the nutrition intake summary back in. This makes it so easier to track than just using the percentages. Back to 5 üåü
"New update removed option to track coffee intake, which was the only place where I could track it. Sometimes the app wouldn't track sleep automatically and count wrong amount of steps. The sports option is uncomfortable (except jogging) because have to input data manually. The last update was the last drop for me"
"I was using the app to help manage my weight and you remove that feature. There's no barcode scan option, the food database is lacking and you still make people enter water by glass instead of oz. There are things that people want in a health tracker and Samsung has to be 1 of the worse. At least allow for syncing to 3rd party apps if you're not going to provide basic features."
"It's actually gotten worse. What is up with wanting access to our PHONE CONTACTS? I used it a couple of years ago, and it was ok. Now, I walked for about 1.5 hrs, and it says I only took 4,439 steps in 6 km. I uninstalled it. It's too bad because it was kind of handy. I've noticed that most Samsungs apps are worse, and their phones give owners less control over their overpriced electronics. Another SNOOP APP."
Great app could use improvement on food and adding food nutritional facts. Sometimes it does seem like it's getting hacked when data yoyos back and forth. But the challenges and pedometer is a good way to track how far one goes in a day so it's easier to get motivated.
"I've seen so many complaints about the last update. So many people need to call Samsung to discuss the issues. I don't want to call Samsung . I just want the weight trends back. So easy to program for the user , enable or disable weighy trends, thats it . And I believe so many other features did not need to be removed/changed imho ."
"I updated the app and they removed functionality I use every day. Maybe I'm in the minority, but the weight management feature has helped me tremendously. I'm really bummed it was removed. They also made it a requirement to give them your phone number in order to use the ""together"" features."
"Left a review stating the login load screen error and was sent a prompt to go the website to complete a 2 step authentication factor and it DID NOT work. Same issue.. Its an issue with the apps log in, a 2 step authentication factor from the website is not going to fix a problem within the app. We need an update not more intrusions like 2 step authentication or cache clearing. Clearly the problem is on your end and needs to be resolved on your end. Next time it goes down to 1 star."
"Great app to help staying healthy. However, there is one shortcoming of it. It has no tracking map, which shows kind of map where, how many kilometers and how many steps you walked. Please, consider adding this feature to it. Thank you!"
"Pretty good. Though can you please change the input data to add exact times insted of increments of 5, and even take that data and add about the number of steps somone of that size would take for that mileage at that pace to the total steps? I have to use my old running watch for cross country races because the Samsung watch doesn't start right on time, but then I miss thousands of steps and the exact workout being recorded."
"It will no longer let you access your own information if you don't give it permission to manage phone calls. Edit: I have no interest in any 'together feature' and I do not give apps unnecessary permissions. A step counter (which is what most people would use an app like this for) should not need phone permissions. I would like to be able to delete my data, but I can't access it!"
"I loved using this app because i didn't have to have it open all the time, and i didn't have to sign in, and everything was going well, but now i need to sign in to check my progress and it can't even let me sign in. Now i still get the notifications but can't see my progress beyond ""you have gotten 60 minutes of xercise"" but i don't know if i am even doing well due to the sign in screen blocking everything the app had to give."
"Auto detection fails constantly. The steps are being counted so it knows I'm moving but they are only sometimes shown as a walking activity. Due to the way steps are shown only as averages not totals, but walking shows the months total, this makes it hard to provide distance evidence for walking the race for life i take part in each month EDIT for the reply: No I will not call an american uber from the UK. It would cost too much"
"Why can't any updates to this app leave the mileage alone? It seems like every time it updates, something is wrong with the mileage tracking. When I first start my exercise, it won't track my mileage. I have to go about a 1/4 of a mile, stop it, and restart it before it will track my distance. Really annoying!"
"New update is terrible!!! It doesn't log all of my steps. There are workouts that should be added to the list for tracking for example pilates isn't listed. There's no reminder for drinking water, but there's one for movement and even that sensor is off!"
"After speaking to customer support....the app is now not compatible with phones outside of the Samsung Family.... which would have been great to know before spending $100 on a Samsung watch that I can no longer use.... ORIGINAL POST: I'm not able to sign in. The loading screen just continually clocks, and when searching online found that many people have had this issue since the update and only solved it by downloading older versions of the app from different websites....."
Good but needs to integrate with more apps and devices. Want to get a smart scale but can't find much that syncs direct with Samsung health or the devices app. Syncing with google fit would also be useful.
"The most recent update to my Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra has ruined this app. If I could give it a zero, I would. It went from being extremely accurate to now recording thousands of steps while I am sleeping. I even worked with a chat technician for an hour, their recommendation, delete the app and find a better one - from a Samsung employee! Terribly disappointed in this app."
"I agree with others. I loved the features until phone access was required. You can say it's for other reasons, but I don't use those features. You don't need my phone, contacts, or call history to allow me to track water intake, sleep, and workouts."
The app was fine and worked great but now you have to agree to give them access to all your information including contacts just to use basic features like step trackers. I did not sign up for multiple contracts so that you can try to farm information on everything I do and every one I know. Not worth it.
"I like the app, but parts are incorrect. The ""Food"" section could be a lot better if the food labels were right. I selected the exact brand and type of food I ate, and compared the labels... There are many food labels that are not correct, in this system. Without the correct label information, the whole nutrition calculation is off. Please fix this, and I will adjust my review accordingly."
"This used to be an awesome app with a function called ""Stress"" which acted like a pulse oximeter. There was also a function that just measured your pulse. I checked the accuracy against an actual pulse oximeter and it was pretty accurate. When I got my new Samsung a couple of weeks ago, this app no longer performs these functions. It counts my steps and tells me how long I was asleep based on when I put my phone down and when I picked it up again, but otherwise is useless."
"It lost my steps. It'd count them during the day but at the end of the day, they'd disappear (wouldn't show up in trends). Reinstalling didn't fix it. It eventually started working again on the Nov 1st without me doing anything. I lost a streak of about 3 months and thus stopped using it. It's still installed, but I don't trust it anymore to keep track of my steps."
I used the weight management feature every day. The app is pointless for me now the feature has been deleted. I can't see any reason to wear my Samsung watch. I spent hundreds of pounds on my watch and it has been great up to now. Very annoyed. I was going to buy the newest galaxy watch but I don't think I'm going to bother. Shopping for an alternative...
Love the app it really causes me to watch what I eat. Two things for improvment would for it to count my steps while on the treadmill. Also be able to turn off and on my steps throughout the day. When I pause and the turn back on it tracked my driving time between pkaces. Not good.
"Update to April 2021 review. So, I've come to realize that the HR Sensor is quite sensitive--meaning if one's fingers are cold, sweaty, or wet, the reading won't work well. I'm guessing any one of these conditions inhibit the sensor's ability to detect a pulse? Right...üôÑ. Well, whatever, is what it is, I guess. ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
"It's a decent all round fitness app, however I find on my runs, even though audio is enabled to announce my distance and times, it does not work consistently and picks and chooses when it wants to work which can mean I can have an incomplete run. However, I do recommend it generally to use for all basic needs."
"The frequency of weekly update is inexcusable. In 26 weeks, I've had 13 updates, and in the last 13 weeks, I've had 3. They're supposed to be weekly... I finally decided to invest in the Galaxy Watch Active 2 to track activity so I don't have to bring my phone on runs (Huawei P20 Pro). Might have to start using my phone with Strava again. Also, Strava on the watch is terrible, syncing is a nightmare (lost activities) so I just make SHealth transfer data to Strava. And even that is inaccurate."
"I am having trouble seeing the weight trend graph? Ever since I set a target weight, the graph is so hard to see. The Y axis goes from 40lb to 140lb jumpin by increments of 20lbs so my trend looks like a straight line. If I don't have a target, the graph looks normal. Otherwise I love the app, but the weight tracking is important to me.."
The new version is terrible! Completely useless app now without weight management and grams/percentage tracking of nutrients. New interface is like a child's play thing. Please bring back the old one. I am probably going to change to the apple ecosystem as Samsung is no good to me anymore.
"The new update is awful. The nutrition no longer immediately displays numbers like protein consumed. Instead there are useless bars. I have to click on ""learn more"" to get actual information. This is just one of several changes that are really disappointing. My wife already stopped using this app in favor of a different one and I'm strongly considering following her."
"I'm not sure what you guys have done to this app in conjunction to the watch, but since the last update, my steps aren't being counted nearly as much, it'll tell me to stand up and stretch (and I'll be at work, on my feet and making food), and my stairs aren't being counted. It'd be nice if this was fixed"
"This USED TO BE a good app. All I had to do is turn on my phone & it automatically started. Counted every step even as I prepared to go to work. Or if I wanted to log a specific workout it did. Now I have to make sure to press the step numbered circle or it won't count your steps. Today I made sure to turn it on have been up & down steps, walked about 3 miles in the course of my day & yet it has only recorded 137 steps! It is in my pocket, where I've always kept it. Really disappointing!."
"Very useful app. Been using the app for two years and never disappointed. However, the recent updates somehow developers removed some elements in audio guide. E.g. I used to get audio guide with pace information at each interval(1km). Nowadays, there is no mention of pace during the workout in audio guide. Regards"
"Good general app with, sadly, a lot of ANNOYING failures. Biggest gripe: Tracks altitude, but doesn't summarise total climb!!! WHAT IS THE POINT?! Samsung do ANY of your developers run/cycle/walk hills or mountains??? Utter fail, folks. -sit up and dumbell rep counts don't work with Galaxy watch Active 2. Denying one of the big points of buying the watch. Weight has to be manually input, despite my scales app being a Google one."
"This app was good some 3 years ago, but every new update (started 1.5 year ago) new minus to app. I lost and an loosing all fitness programs I added. Management of target weight is still missing. I cannot see awerage weight values per weeks or months. With last update - I cannot record or see weight accurately. Home screen functions changed again in bad way. You are downgrading instead of upgrading the app."
After updating there are a lot of bugs. Couple of times app stop recording my running exercise. Few days ago it stops update together section and I didn't know what to do. So I re-installed the app - and it deleted all information about previous steps and exercises. I'm very disappointed.
Pretty good at keeping track of things. One thing that could be improved is calculating calories properly. Probably would be more accurate if you could put your climate in since you burn calories walking in cold and warmer places. It also keeps asking me to step up my activity even after I've done 2h of it but when you're at work or school I don't think you can put more time into it.
"I would really like to thank you for the wonderful app! I started running for the first time in my life and managed to reach 5k in 40 minutes, just as the fitness program had planned! I am so happy and grateful for this professionally planned program which made me a real runner. Now I'm working out using other fitness programs presented by the app, which had disappeared for some unknown reason on my phone.Now they've suddenly reappeared and I'm so excited to have them back. God bless you :)"
"Horrible updates, it was working fine until the updates. All it does now is count steps. It wont record any workouts. And when I try to set it, it counts down to start then won't putting it on pause. Don't know what's the point off the app if I can't use it"
"I would have given Five star, if I didn't face the problem during workout. The problem is automatically app pauses, during workout , mainly during walk and the app does not resume automatically. Most of the people who have a similar app, has told that, this app doesn't work properly in Non Samsung phones. Other wise this app is really good. My phone brand is Redmi Note 5 Pro."
This app has great User interface but one big issue with Shealth it will not support any bluetooth BMI scales. You have to enter the data manually. Why dont samsung build a simple interface to connect to BMI scales app like ActiveX which syncs directly to google FIT . I prefer Google Fit only because of its versatile interface with most of the devices.
Not happy with the update that changed the format of the screen from boxes of our choice to click on to the new format of having to scroll a long list to get to what we want. Time waster and inconvenient. Any possibility of changing it back? Other than that a good app.
It is an amazing application. It is really good that it exists. Thank you to whoever made it. It has changed my life a lot. It has many wonderful features. I really recommend it.‚ô°
"Great tracking steps. Maybe not as good with calories, unless maybe if you have a Samsung watch, which I do not. I like this because I can easily get trends for weeks and months. I can have bad days and still see if I am continuing to improve on average."
"Hate giving 1 star reviews, but I think this is necessary. App recently updated and removed ability to count Galaxy Watch steps only on my non-Samsung phone. Now whatever I do massively overestimates my walking distance and therefore my calorie output. If I cant trust my expentiture, I cant rely on my net calorie intake so there's no point in using the app at all. CS they told me I had to buy a Samsung phone for it to work. If given the choice I would have opted for a different wearable."
A few months ago I thought this app was great but things have changed since the last update. Two of the features I used most are now gone: weight management and caffeine tracker. I was able to lose a few pounds using the weight management feature but hadn't yet reached my goal and now it's gone. I am now looking for another app. I was also sad to see the end of the community feature.
"Well since the update (16.0.047) and requiring phone access renders the app useless. Privacy Policy states it will sync contact for it's ""together feature"" (which I have never used) and even if I disable it contacts synced will not be removed. This is not an ""Opt in"" it's brute force! Policy doesn't state why it needs phone access either!! Generic ""people won't read this"" policy doc. The standard answer of ""feature enchantment"" is a cop out of a reply. Fun and cool while it lasted."
Totally backwards system. Never bothered using it and opted for Samsung fit 2 smart watch. Now you can't even use the newest features Samsung has promised re: ecg and blood pressure on many of not most galaxy watches.... supposedly the sensors have gone bad at the back of many of the units while Samsung drew out the release of these new features and will need replaced.
Used to work great. Now with the new update it cannot track your workouts with GPS.
"I REALLY enjoyed the feature that kept up with my weight managment and calories taken and used up. The recent updat in July removed these features. I will be uninstalling this app. What a shame!! I see I am not alone in my disgust for the new update. PLEASE, PLEASE bring back this feature. It is is one of the main reasons I have a Samsung and not an Iphone."
"It's good for keeping track of steps, active time, food and water intake. But I hate that they keep taking stuff out. Weekly or monthly Weight averages are no longer available (only daily). Neither is the overall daily calory status. I used to enjoy those two things."
"I mostly love this app. Great features and able to track things. However, I do not comprehend why there are not options for the caffeine tracker, unless I am missing it somewhere. it doesn't let you set what type of drink or the caffeine amount. it defaults to 80 mg. I know for a fact the green tea I drink is nowhere near that much. therefore, that tracker does not help me at all. this could be a future improvement."
Please bring back the dedicated oximeter button option! It was one of the main reasons I went for another S7 instead of a cheapie but newer replacement that honestly had better options in other areas! I have chronic health issues and I need it to not sit spinning for 10min only to offer a stress level and/or pulse rate but not the reading I truly needed (which is my oxygen level)
"Hate it...Used to Love it! The update makes things less useful beyond a very basic level. I've been using it, and loving it, for over a year, but I'm going to have to try installing an older version if i can find it. Either that or switch back to My Fitness Pal."
"Love this app! Just wish you could customize the settings. If you change set points, such as bed time and wakeup times, it changes all the data. My schedule changes and it would be nice to do a temporary change without changing it all."
"The new update sucks. Why the hell does it need access to my contacts, ability to make phone calls, and all the other BS they added in this update. I used this app a lot this year to track fitness and activity, but there is no way I'm allowing that level of intrusion into my personal data. Eventually Samsung is will get hacked and my information will be compromised, so thanks but no thanks. If they don't change that, I'll never use this app ever again."
Literally stopped recording my sleep after the latest update. I'm new to this app but if it breaks this easily...its probably not for me
"Not bad except it doesn't automatically detect and record sleep during the day when wearing my gear fit 2. For me it's naps. For others it might be shift work. I""d even be happy if i could prepare it by pressing a record button called ""record nap"" like one can press a button at the start of a workout."
"I have used this app for many years and have logged more than eight million steps. Recent updates have rendered the step counter poor quality. It doesn't update frequently and often renders low step counts on paths that I know should create higher totals. If it's not fixed soon, I will uninstall it. I expect better from Samsung."
"Something appears to have happened with the last update. Every time I try to use the stress monitor, the app crashes. Also, all of my data was deleted in the update. And what happened to the O¬≤ monitor? I loved that! Really bummed out about my favorite health app."
"This app works great but it seems that a few of the people tend to cheat the app in the challenges. Wish they couldn't do that so the challenges would be more realistic and fun. For example how can someone walk or run 1,000,000 steps in less than 1 month. Just my observation."
"Something has changed. Please fix it. The map no longer tracks my route unless the screen is on. So if the phone sleeps or my music app is open, the map stops, then I get a straight line next time I activate samsung health. It still monitors speed, distance etc. This used to work fine but not anymore."
"Update : I had some problems with the ""Fitness"" tab that was empty (showed ""no item"") and I couldn't add any program (my phone is a Galaxy S9). The Samsung support team have been very helpfull and they resolved the issue quickly. Everything works fine now. That you. Great app."
"What happened to the option to track health metrics in graph format by week and month? This made it incredibly easy to compare and monitor physiological changes in response to behavioral/environmental changes (i.e. impacts of my new cpap, meditation, etc). Loved this app until recently. Each update has come with the removal of helpful features to the point that it's no longer useful for my purposes. Consistency matters to customers! Listen to them and return the loyalty. Time to switch to Apple"
"Ha ha this app developement. Just think of something you use a lot, and the next update will remove it, or screw with it so it frustrates the hell out of you. I've tried to use this for years but I've had enough of your so called developement. If I can, I will uninstall or disable. Something to do with a party and a brewery come to mind when I think of my past dealing with this app. STOP MESSING WITH STUFF THAT WORKS. Launch a different app for different sports give us a choice before you change"
I had this app on my galaxy 7 and was very happy with it. When I went to the 9 I noticed that it no longer had options for activities like yard work and similar activities. I have a large property and a lot of my daily activities involve things not normally considered as exercise. I would like to see those back as an option.
"Since they got rid of weight management this app has been almost useless to me. I could continue to use it for a while, but it no longer shows total calories burned and they've lost a lot of personalizations options. It seems every update makes the app lose functionality"
I use your app on my Galaxy S9. I think it's a great app with everything that it tracks. I wanted to see if it was possible to make a suggestion. I know you have the spot to log food but it would be extremely helpful if we were able to scan the bar codes of the foods we're eating. That way it would give you a more accurate calorie count based on the actual foods and brands you're consuming. Based on this I'm giving four stars.
"If there is a negative 5 , i would give it -5. I used to love this app. With each update they manage to make it worse. Congrats Samsung. Now it wants access to my contacts and manage my phone calls. . I had defered the two step verification option by selecting ""not now"". The app wont open now stating the session had expired. But it doesn't give me an option to login. Edit: Samsung's response doesn't address the login issue. The app updates and I cant use it anymore."
"I very much dislike the removal of the weight management widget within the app. I used it every day! Would really like to see that function come back. If there were people that use the app, but didn't use that function, I think they were uneducated about what it really did for them."
"Hate, this app takes away features with each upgrade!!! The calorie log is unusable as can only log the foods Samsung has put in. If you add a food, you can't seem to remove. Can't just log an amount. The weight recorder Was good, as did show past average weights, and could see resent weights, but down graded to a Line!!!! Am having to use another app to get good info. Worst app I have ever used, shame as love the watch, but thinking of changing it just because of the app!!!!!!"
"Update: 6/11/22 after uninstalling and reinstalling the Samsung Health app the pedometer steps are being captured again! THANK YOU FOR THE QUICK ASSISTANCE DEVELOPERS!!! 5STARS!! ""The steps from my Samsung gear (watch) are not being captured by my Samsung health app. I used to be able to see the steps from my watch, but the app has stopped allowing those steps to be shown... I have done a factory reset on my watch and the problem persists."""
"I have turned this app on as I was thinking about buying a Samsung smart watch for workouts and wanted to see the functionality. however I've never used the functionality as when I turn it on it says my 45min ride to work is a 15min run, or the next day it's a 40min run, or a 15min bike ride. with that level of accuracy I just gave up. maybe the watch would help but I've never had a phone sports app with this bad reporting."
Is there a way to use the older version? I really enjoyed the older version and I get why the new one needs all the permissions and what not but I really don't want to make an entirely new account. I would much rather just continue for this thing to count my steps and give me little 20 minute fitness videos. Update: Ah the box standard bot answer. Classic and expected. Anyway I found an old version and am happy with it.
"**Update**I got a quick reply, cleared out the cache and now its working again!! Thank you!! Major Disappointment!! Lately my Samsung Health app has been terrible. When I open it up, it never gets past the screen where the three guys are walking. So many of my workouts haven't been recorded because of it. I'm so disappointed, I love Samsung Health! Lately though not so much!!"
"I prefer the previous version of this app. The Weekly Summary has only populated once, thus far, in 2022. I don't even see those past several weeks appearing in the weekly summary's dropdown. Spent a recent evening speaking with a Samsung representative, who had said the technical snafu on the app would be repaired.üëéüèº Also, on 3/28/2022, Samsung deployed another update, but my Android is not providing the technical capability in making that update. Someone in D.C. is controlling Samsung's app."
This app was great until the weight management part was removed. You should have worked on improving the weight management portion instead of getting rid of it. You all just pop off and change things that aren't improving the app but are starting to make it irrelevant. People have been stuck in the house gaining weight for months. Dumb idea to remove what we were using to get back on track. Bring back the weight management section
And the app gets worse with each update. The first time it got rid of weight management so you can't easily track calorie input to output. The last update gets rid of snacks. I have to add them all at the end of the day now. This app is turning into a glorified pedometer.
"Hi, I absolutely love using ""Step Tracker"" to help w/my accountability; it challenges me daily, to make sure that I've completed my own personal fitness goal. But some days, when I just cannot seem to ""give a darn"" or just too busy, it sure would help if I could use the ""Coins Club"" as an added incentive. Somehow, it quit working; MANY folks cannot figure out how to repair the ""Internal Server"" issue that it notifies. What can I do? (Screenshot available if needed)"
"Absolutely love the app, gives you daily motivation by way of goal setting. I never really cared how many ""steps"" I walked every day but now that I have something to work towards I'm finding myself looking for reasons to walk instead of sit. And the inactive alert on the S3 is genius, reminds me whenever I've been sitting for longer than an hour to get up and keep my body alert. Highly Recommend!!!"
"Was great up until 3rd party app integration was removed. This app does not track my steps correctly and I do not have a Samsung watch, only a Fitbit. Up until July 1st there were 3rd party apps that synced my Fitbit steps with Samsung. Now they have removed that ability and 2/3 of my steps do not get counted. I average between 14-15k steps and Samsung app counts 5-6k.. I do not see myself getting a Samsung wearable anytime soon, so until they re-allow 3rd party integration the review will suck."
"Great app with plenty of helpful features. However, the calorie goal in the food tracker doesn't match my calorie goal in the weight management section, and for some reason I can't adjust it. This makes it harder to keep track of my calories and my goals."
"I used to absolutely love this app! However, after the latest update it is useless to me. You removed the calorie gauge that tells you whether you are or over or under on your calories?! Seriously! You remove the absolute most important feature on the app that allows you to track your calories to lose weight?! What is the logic there LOL!"
"I loved this app until the last update. Requiring access to phone calls is ridiculous and unnecessary. If there is a feature that needs that access, you should only prompt for it when that feature is initially accessed. For those of just recording health information, it should not be required. Bye Samsung!"
The app is nice but there are features missing and or inaccurate. The calorie counting settings are not accurate. Also to record your water intake there is only one set (1 glass corresponding to 250 ml.). I am in search of the one app that will do step water and calories counting and this is not it.
"Have been using this app from the beginning, has worked averagely all along. after not being able to obtain help for the S5's or S7's have switched completely to apple health along with watches. Wow, if you need integration or a more well rounded experience, it's worth a look."
"How can I rate it if it won't even let me sign in? I've been trying to sign into this app for the past week and when I put in my email and password I just get the loading circle and nothing else happens. I've tried to delete and redownload, cleared the storage and cache. Changed my password incase that was the reason. Nothing works."
"This use to be such a great app but the recent update sucks. What happened to the calory counter? Why is the app now always running in the background? And who changed the layout? It is now harder to use and has less features. It also doesn't talk to devices or other apps any more, I use to be able to read my smart watch perfect but now it doesn't connect at all and I have had to connect to other apps like chronometer to do what I use to be able to do here. Very disappointed with the changes."
"The latest update is a fail. In trying to set up the two step verification, I enter the code that has just been sent to my phone and the verify button is inoperable, only the time extension button works. If I try to skip the two step verification setup, the app gets hung up and does not proceed."
"Was great until a week ago. Now the steps won't sync from my watch. Tried the instructions provided to other people with this issue. Pause, clear cache, force stop, reboot. None of it fixed the issue. Giving 2 stars bc at least it's still tracking sleep. Only reason I bought this watch was to track steps though so this is now useless to me. If so many of us have this issue why isn't a fix being put out for it?"
Brilliant app. Love that I can keep a track of my food intake aswell as my excerise. I also like that everything is shown on one screen so no scrolling through multiple screens to see each thing. Haven't tried the together feature as yet but I think it's great to help keep yourself and friends motivated.
"Why have you removed weight management / calorie counter ??? Surely that's a fundamental part of a health app. This app was great until recent update, and I have used it to great success, but now very disappointing, and makes my recent expensive smartwatch seem a bit pointless. Please reinstate these features, and make the app great once again. I dont want to install another tracking app, I want it all in one."
"So disappointed with this update. Can't get the step notice off the home screen without disabling all notices. Auto workout detector is disabled and I can't enable it. 16 independent categories of notifications to deal with? Are you kidding? Going shopping for a new health app Samsung. And I have your phone and your watch, so that is saying something."
I am giving this one star because I have been locked out after the latest update. It asks if I agree to the privacy policy. I hit agree then it says I need to give it permission in settings. I have done that but then it just puts me back into the cycle. I tried to contact tech through email and got nowhere. I was able to contact Samsung help by phone.They resolved the problem. Working great again.
Not super user friendly your watch keeps asking for it to be installed when its on and running. It seems like samsung has to many separate parts of the business it's just a pain to get everything setup and working. I have heard those with a Samsung phone have a better experience then I have had.
"Since the last update, the kilometers at the end of my cycling workout are indicated incorrectly. The route on the map recorded correctly but kilometers don't correspond. Consequently the calories are also indicated incorrectly. Thank you for the support. Leonard App still not working correctly after your suggestions. I'm trouble contacting you with Contact us."
The upgrade makes the exercise portion slower to use and less intuitive. I miss the block layout - don't like scrolling for each exercise - and the ability to format the blocks on the screen to suit my routine. I will search for a better app.
"Can't use the app at all on my phone. It installs and opens fine but as soon as I log in I get an infinite loading screen. Just got an Active2 and wanted to use this app. Clearing cache, reinstalling or restarting phone does not work. Please fix. EDIT: Yeah, I'm returning this POS watch. Everyone knows your clear cache solution doesn't work and there's no way in hell I'm going out of my way risking security downloading older APKs. Screw Samsuck!"
Update: Now even requires I enter my Phone number and won't even show me my old data! You don't need my Phone number to track my weight. Deleting this app. Old review: The new widget looks soo ugly. The text is too small and that orange Heartbeat symbol sticks out way too much from my regular home screen design. Also too much empty space. Please give us back the old widget. At least as an option!
Great App... love the action sports üëè challenges. Something for everyone and any age!
Updated the app to the newest version and it told me I needed to sign in. When I went to sign in using my Samsung account it said it could not find an account by that name. Called Samsung and they said that it is a know problem and they are working to fix it. No idea when it will be fixed. Great! Now my app doesn't work because I installed your update. Good job!
"The latest update wants to access my phone and contacts. Samsung says this is about optimizing the user experience (seemingly clueless to the fact that people track some pretty personal info in a health app, and so the privacy of that app should be bulletproof). Nope. Big nope. Won't even let me retrieve my old data. Uninstalling."
"This app is useless unless you own a Galaxy Fit for or smartwatch. Used to be able to record heart rate and oxygen level using only your phone, but looks like Samsung have removed this option to force people to buy their smart products. Samsung have responded to advise that it is measure as part of the stress checker, however as per my earlier review, there is no option to measure bpm or stress using only the camera or fingerprint sensor on my phone, it appears a external device is required."
"This does a great job of keeping you up to date on your health goals, and suggests materials to help you achieve them. The app does NOT allow voice input nor does it accept input from Bixby(Android), Siri (Apple), or Lexa. It needs to as stopping to open the app to add sleep, food, water etc is inconvenient and should be seemless. It's a very ""needy"" app without this feature."
"I am truly disappointed with this app and have been actively looking for a new app and even a new watch to go with it. They took weight management section away which helped me pay attention to my calories burned and how much more I needed to do to meet my goals. Now they have taken the widget that show calories burned. Now, they have taken weekly summeries away! Good grief!"
"Latest update makes this app garbage. Ability to see graphs of longterm weight tracking my weeks, months, years has been removed. The graphing for calories and nutrients is practically useless now. The app was great before the update. Now it's useless. Now finding a different app to replace it."
"Samsung needs to take ownership of this app and stop allowing cheaters to post there scores. Each month an event starts and after 1 day dozens of people complete the event. That's 200k step (over 90 miles) in one day. I doubt it! Also, I like the old layout that shows more on one page instead of scrolling."
"I downloaded another app that figures out how much water I need, reminders for when to drink and it has adjustable cup sizes for intake. All these are helpful and would be nice to have on this app. I still don't like the new layout, a lot more scrolling and time wasted."
"Its a decent application with a lot of good details some other apps don't have, but it isn't a core application. Google Fit is a core app that exists on all Android devices, smartwatches, etc. But Samsung Health won't sync with it? It syncs with Apple Fit but not Google Fit? That makes no sense at all. There are third party apps that will sync data but those cost money and cause problems with Google Fit. This is another stubborn refusal to acknowledge market leaders (Bixby?)"
"Doesn't work unless you grant excessive permissions. Obviously the body sensors and in many cases the location data during activity are integral to the function of this type of ap. It is the obsurd phone and camera access requirement that plagues this ap. I don't care to use the ""Together"" feature and I don't need this ap to sync my contacts or use my camera for any reason. Requiring it makes this an obtrusive useless ap that will not start. No thank you. A big disappointment."
"I agree with a previous review. I'm angry that I must give Samsung my contacts in order to use the app and see my previous tracking info. Samsung's reply that they don't use contacts' information for anything other than the app is irrelevant. If samsung were to ask for contacts in order to use certain features, like adding friends to motivate each other, it would be reasonable. But it's unfair to suddenly ask for contacts in exchange for use of the app along with months of tracking."
Bring back old features like the weight management the last update was not helpful. I used it mainly for that feature. This isn't a technical support problem; just bring that feature back. Many people have voiced out below they want it back!
"The app was fine until they updated their privacy policy. There is no reason for a fitness app to require 2 factor authentication. I am just trying to go for a run. Also, there should be no reason for the app to want to manage all of my phone calls or view all of my files. Plus the 2 factor doesn't even work. The text message never comes with the code. I had to uninstall this app."
"Never mind the last review, I think after re-installing it it seems to be back on track. It is overall a very good health app and it is easy enough to get back ups of your data. The presentation of data is easy enough to read and the overall tracking is great."
"This application has helped me a lot with my sleep apnea, along with my galaxy watch 4, to monitor my oxygen during sleeping, Is there a way to add an vibration alert when the oxygen drops at a certain level? Like the one the heart rate has, that will really help a lot, my oxygen drops to the low 80s and having this alert will stop that from happening, this will be a great tool for all of us with sleep apnea problems, thank you very much for the great support!"
Samsung dropped the ability to measure Stress directly. Now you need to buy their watch. It's a rip-off.
"After talking to tech support and clearing my cache, the app still didn't work properly. The issue was for the running tracker. The timing and distance wasn't working and this app singlehandly ruined my fitness journey. On the hunt for another one. Also the stress monitor is a joke, soooo not accurate."
This used to be a great app. But now with every update it gets worse and worse. It started by taking away the part that showed you calorie intake compared to you calories burned in a day. Now it is you can no long edit your sleep you can only delete it. Also you can only view your weight loss day to day you can no longer see the average over a week or month. It is getting to the point that I thinking I may want to see what out is out there for health apps.
"Review after using more than 1 month: app ‚â†==(,,,is very good and capturing steps very accurately only the issue is once the mobile screen get off, after some intervel app stops counting the steps(practically it is not posaible to keep screen active), summerising to this app only counting the steps when screen is active. my Many of friends uninstalled the app for same reasons."
I like using this app to improve myself. Sometimes it's hard to access past information like step counts. I'm pregnant so it would be nice be able to include that in calculating my health goals on here. Otherwise user friendly whether you are an athlete or just a casual person looking to improve a little.
I used to love this app .. now it no longer shows me my weight lost history the way it used where I can see daily ..weekly.. monthly etc. Itb was much quicker. If this is not fixed asap I will have to delete it. It only shows daily .. and does not collect and present data for weight loss that will help someone trying to track like it used to.. FIX THIS ISSUE!!
"2nd review. 1st mention problems since new update, was given a number to call but being in Aus call couldn't connect. Got through to customer service via net, was given trouble shooting tips, 4 didn't work & final suggestion was too complicated for me to navigate so I hope my issue is resolved in future updates. I enjoy the app but I'm now having issues with 1 out of 3 food searches, search tab doesn't refresh & I'm only able to 'skip meal' or close app & search again. **Fixed with update**"
"Quite nice and reliable but...it is extremely annoying that the watch is continuing recording the sleep after you wake up, interact with the watch(watch4) but continue laying down in bed and even stay on the phone(samsungs21). It should really know when that I have been in bed on my phone for an hour and not sleeping."
"Had this app on previous phone, but I shattered the phone and had to upgrade and now the S20 doesn't have the heart rate or pulse reader. I have heart disease and need to keep track of info, so this is VERY disappointing, especially for such an expensive phone. With everything going on with CoVid19 it is even more important. Why can't you just do an update for all devices to add yhese back in, it could mean life or death to someone."
Ever since the new android 12 release for my phone the app does not function. Will not sync to my Samsung Active2 watch or my smart scale. When removing these devices from my phone the app continues to not function and just straight up will not display any of my data as if it's in a state of constantly loading. Will change my rating to 5 stars once this issue is fixed as I very much enjoy the app but it's current state is very disappointing
"The app was amazing until the recent update when the app has stopped calculating the steps. I did all the steps related to pedometer by pausing and restarting the step counter, cleared the cache, reinstalled the app and even tested the sensors of my phone. Yet the issue is same with not a single step being counted. Kindly resolve this issue."
"I was really liking this app until it stopped syncing with Strava??? It seemed to sync at a certain time a day, then random and now not at all ( over a week). Very annoying. Updated: syncing is now instant so no longer an issue. Does exactly what is expected."
"Update wrecked your app. Loved the steps counter, but last time I used it, the app asked to be updated. Then it asked for complete access to everything in my phone - No, Samsung - why should people trust you with all those permissions? You can continue to say the same things to us all, about how it's just to make the app function, but that doesn't make it better or acceptable that you ask to be able to use my phone App, my camera, my contacts, my microphone. How about NO! App deleted."
"I really like it, it helps me review the calories i take and what to change in my diet to get healthier. I also like a lot the trainning programs. I would add an extra program for helping people that want to loose some weight and get healthier. Something where u set the goal and it calculates the daily calorie intake, that tracks down the results of everyday (doesnt start everyday from 0) and gives u tips for a healthy diet. For the newer phone versions, i would add a scan that can help you take a photo of the nutritional informations table in the back of the packages of the foods and automatically register them at the daily food and calorie intake . Apart this, I'll keep using it for a while and if i see helpful, buy also the smartwatch."
"This app is great. But if we can change the step count it would be great. Because even when I'm traveling in the bus, app counts that moment and add more steps to the step count. Which is kinda like a faulty thing to me. Otherwise this app is awesome. Please Samsung I know you can fix this issue. üòÑüòÑüëåüëå"
"Overall this is a great app, i love the fact that it automatically detects my workouts. One thing i would love is if we're given an opportunity to challenge people whom uses other apps, like my partner doesn't use Samsung and had suggested we sync our data to Stridekick but Samsung health can't do that, i would appreciate if we can allow such syncs to other fitness apps to be able to challenge our friends and families who are not using this app."
"Would be nice to add a feature to get notifications for drinking water reminders if you are not on track for your daily target. There's notification for all the useless stuff but for nothing important. Also would be nice to be able to remove Steps from items, cannot do that."
"Not impressed with the latest update. Information is now more difficult to access and understand quickly. More space is used to display less information, requiring more tapping and scrolling around to use. Large, aggressive ads now dominate the main screen. I barely use it anymore."
"I actually like this app.... I would like to see sugar listed for more foods. Being a diabetic I'm constantly watching my sugar and carbs. One downside is the list of vendors food products appears incomplete and I have found many items I enjoy eating are not in the preprogrammed list. Overall this is a good app and I firmly recommend it, and will continue to use it myself."
"I loved this app, but now that it wants access to more and more controls in my phone I'm out! No health app needs to be able to make or manage my phone calls. So disappointing. The response from Samsung was they don't use my personal information for anything except to enhance user ability of app. That doesn't make me feel any safer giving a fitness app access to phone calls. Until that permission is removed, I will find alternatives."
"bring back the stand alone Sp02 meter. response: yes. and this answer is discoraging. The stress option takes too long to finish. Especially while exercising. You can't track saturation measurements by activity in the stress feature. it was a detriment to your app to remive a good, functional, aspect."
"It was a good app before the update and the weight management feature was removed. If I just wanted to track my steps and enter data, I would have bought a pedometer and made a spreadsheet. Unfortunately i'm tied to the app via accessories, but I'll be switching to another brand with a more comprehensive app in the future."
"Loving how well the app works with my S3 watch. Records activities very well. Wish there was more outdoor activities to select from vs just using ""other workout"". The list of gym exercises is pretty extensive( curls, bench...) but no xcountry or down hill skiing, climbing, snowshoeing, MTB biking, canoeing/kayaking. It be nice to see them added on for a true outdoorsy experience."
"I love the app and the layout it has. I also really like everything it allows me to track, however the app is constantly crashing and when it crashes my most recent info isn't saved. If it were not for the constant app crashes this would be a 5 star review."
"This is the best app for fitness! I have been using it for 3 years, and not changing it anytime soon. Although, there are some bugs, like it reads footsteps when I am in Car or Bus, but apart from that, it gives highly accurate readings, like it measures each step, reads accurate sleep time. I guess buying a Samsung Watch or Band will make it better to use. It has also plans for exercises, that are totally free. You must consider this app once. Also, Samsung Devs, Please add Indian foods in it."
"I have lost my recorded steps and somehow this app didn't update my steps for the last few days. Very disappointing. Additionally; all my challenges from the previous months have all disappeared. Please investigate and let me know. I have done more than 11000 steps on 2nd Jan and it says that I have done only 26 steps??? This app is ridiculous, very frustrating."
The manual sleep time setting adds an hour to your input! Changed my score as the bug was fixed in 24 hours !
"I have a similar issue to another. The app has been working just fine up until today. When walking, my mileage is no longer accurate. I had walked approx. 2.5 miles and it only registered .87 miles. Paused, began again. Registered fine, then back to the incorrect data logging. I have not reviewed other exercise monitors."
Was an ok app but now is one of the worst on the market. This is barely a fitteness app. I transferred from fitbit to this because I liked the galaxy watch but now most of those weight management features are gone and I can't really justify keeping the watch for weight management. I'm pretty much waiting for the watch to die or have an accident so I can justify getting a fitbit.
"There needs to be a way to change the food portions. Example, I ate a small pear. I couldn't find a small pear in the drop down menu. I couldn't add toppings or condiments to my subway sandwich. I couldn't add how much tea I drank at dinner, it just said publix tea didn't give an option for 8 oz or more. The water count, maybe milliliters should also be an option. Starbucks now has a pistachio latte, it isn't on the menu. There has to be a way to make it a bit more accurate."
it has been a best app for me but for last few days it is problematic .. It takes time a lot to update activity or program .. As i add a glass of water it takes time so much and step counting is paused still it shows updating and updating.. it sucks.. i add water to measure when i come back to add more glasses it looses old record .. please look into this ..
"My phone just started displaying that the app could not be opened on rooted phone. Every few seconds is so annoying. I did not expect this from samsung. Is it due to the new updates on the phone. If yes, then it is Samsungs fault to not provide proper service to customers who paid for their phone. These kind of errors are so annoying. I don't want to uninstall...i like the app...but now can't use it, due to this error."
"This was a good app until Samsung stopped allowing Withings Health Mate to sync properly with it. You made me choose between a smartwatch that lasts for a day before needing to be charged for 2 hours (Samsung Galaxy Watch4) or Withings Smartwatch that lasts for 30 days on a single charge and has a proper analogue watch. I chose Withings. If you allowed the syncing, then I would have had the best of both worlds."
"Best app for fitness. I use it mainly for cycling and shows through gps, roughly the same speeds as a cycling computer. Location is accurate (in other apps i had issues like location jumping to other streets or stop working). The UI is fairly simple and easy to use. The autotracking is a useful feature as it doesn't require you to input the start and finish of the activity everytime. 10/10 best fitness app to date."
"Disappointed with the redesign. The old one was more more intuitive. However, the main issue is that the app is no longer syncing with MyFitnessPal. Tried resetting the permissions and disconnecting and reconnecting the apps. Still no syncing."
"I have had problems getting my route and map to sync after updates. An uninstall and reinstall didn't fix it. This was preventing me from downloading GPX files too, which is the main use of my GWA2. Luckily, a clearing of all app data rescued it and now I can see my routes again."
"Useful in many case, has foods & water tracking, has fitness programs, tracking sport activities. Must improve: Not everyone eat 3 meals and a snack a day, I have 6; a few of home fitness program where have no or few equipments; cannot auto detect running; adding fitness programs is nightmare, do many step (and search) to add only 1fitness program at the time; cannot know which whole added programs is done or missed; no S tablet support: watching fitness programs and typing on tablet are better"
"Got a Google Pixel 5 today and when I log into my Samsung health app it get stuck in a continuous logging in loop, I have Googled a solution that says I should skip the login but I don't see a skip option, I have tried restarting my phone and uninstalling the app! Help pls Problem solved by downloading an older version, skipping the sign in, signing in through the settings and then updating the app for the most recent version! Thank you!"
"BETTER THAN MYFITNESSPAL. This app is amazing, I typically don't write reviews but the UI is so user friendly, fast, and efficient. I was using my fitness pal, but this thing has everything organized way simpler; all features included (the exercise programs are free) without a needed subscription."
"massive crippling of app. the previous version was fantastic, they have removed so much functionality that it is now an average step counter at best. previously i could add in things like push ups etc to the main page and it would track them and give calorie burn etc, all of that is gone now for plans others decide."
"Day 1 - I'm a little alarmed to read all the comments about key features being REMOVED 6 days ago! I just purchased the Active2 watch and considering taking it back. Also not loving that I can only star 3 workouts for easy access. Had difficulty downloading one of the custom watch faces, and why cant I turn Auto detect workouts on under Advanced in Settings?"
"My step counting and daily progress is Cinderella! Yep, it disappears past midnight! I've tried all the recommended fixes, called the helpline, restarted the app -- nothing works. I was so happy with this app before these problems and now that health tracking has become my number one priority, I think I will move back to Apple iPhone, given its reliability in the health department."
I love this app. I was able to loose a lot of weight just by walking and tracking the food calories. But the last update took away the weight management option wich was really helpful. Hope it will be back soon because it was what makes a difference for person's who want to loose weight.
"I've been using this app for quite a while, and it has been decent... But now you are removing tracking options for no good reason? I used both the weight and caffeine trackers, and having a central app for all of these small things to track was the main benefit of samsung health... But now you are throwing that away. If not for this, it'd be a solid 4/5."
"Best app for runnning; I like that you can choose to have prompts at every K that tells you your pace, distance left and estimated total time; it helps you to keep on track and motivates you to beat the estimated time. The app is really easy to use and lots of different features to keep you interested."
"Confusing, not user friendly, tiny font point, no flexibility, lost my data, etc etc etc. Sleep tracking occasionally gives me a block graph instead of sleep cycle details. I contacted tech support 6x and no department would handle my call. App support just kept looping me around to departments. Some lady unfamiliar with app tried to help? My Watch 3 is WAY more work than what it's worth. It's like having a second job. And BT on my Watch 3 is horrible. I'm returning the Watch 3 today."
I have enjoyed this app for almost 2 years now. But just recently it won't sync without major playing around. Finally I removed and reloaded the app and of course lost all my previous data AND it won't sync again this afternoon. I did upload a phone update and am thinking it may not work with that.
"I left a review months ago about the ""Make/Manage Phone Calls"" permission that Samsung requires, and the developer just responds with an auto-reponse. Anyways, these permissions are awful. For any one else who hates it, Strava is a recommended alternative. I've just downloaded and synced it to my Samsung Active 2, and so far so good. It still requires Storage perm, so take that with a grain of salt. It can at least be used until Samsung Health gets it together."
"My all time favorite. Honestly, I'm furious if I leave my watch at home, it phone on desk. Every step and movement counts! Very encouraging app that allows you to compete and get your closest family and friends walking. Love the graphs and tracking tools an available. Samsung is THE best! üôåüèΩ"
"This app is a severe privacy breach. The app was working just fine before the update, now it wants ALL permissions to your phone or you can't use it. Why does it need to manage my calls? They want to listen in on your private moments to ""optimized"" your experience! Why else is this ""required""? This shouldn't be a requirement for a health app. The good thing as someone else stated, is that you can revoke it after you are on from your settings. If this changes, I will be permanently uninstalling!"
"This app used to be clean and efficient. Now it's bloated with ads and corporate art that seems to be everywhere these days. It isn't necessary to make the app work and it makes everything slower and more cluttered. I don't want to see some fat cartoon woman when curious about how many steps I've taken today. I hate to write a negative review for an app I used to love, but if people don't start complaining about this garbage it won't go away. The dev response is a lie. SoFi ads right in the app!"
"Why is it with every update, the sleep tracker dissappears??"
Bring back weight management. It was a great way to manage calorie intake and consumption. Seeing the calorie intake/expenditure being calculated in real time was great and helped me tremendously. Not sure why there was the need to remove that. I guess I'll be looking for another health app that offers this
"I like the stress tracker. I started using it as a tool for anxiety and meditations. The gage itself is always in ""green"" or ""red"". Never in the in-between. So I have to bring up the actual entry and open it to actually see the number or where it gaged."
"My exercise history is correct (it shows distance walked) but my daily step count is zero when I look at my previous days' step count in the trends section. It used to work, but since upgrading, the step count works at the time of exercise, but after midnight nothing is recorded in my daily step count for that day. I have tried pausing step count and then restarting the count. I have cleared cache and also uninstalled and reinstalled app. Not happy!"
"i have S9 plus. not accurate. why does my phone screen have to be on in order to get accurate measurement? it reduces my battery efficiency. GPS is on all the time but I noticed once my phone screen times out while working out, the measurement pretty much stops. fix it. those should be br ablr to to measure distance at least while screen is off. too many unnecessary permissions requirement."
"Logging in to Samsung Account on the first screen of the app crashes the app 100% of the time on my device. Clearing data, rebooting, reinstall,... Nothing worked. Rolled back to 6.19.1.001, and logging in works fine. After logging in, app can be updated to latest versions and works perfectly."
I love Samsung's hardware but their apps are absolutely idiotic. By using it you give Samsung rights to browse through your data but they don't let you to export your own data!!! it's a handicap app that cannot even detect your device without Galaxy Wearable companion app. It was absolutely impossible to make one fully functional app that doesn't need your contacts to measure your steps.
I liked this app for sleep tracking and women's health. It use to work great. And then it got an update. Deleted all my info it had tracked and since then won't save info I have manually entered. Very disappointing.
Was great when it would connect with my activity tracker. Since latest update took that connection away I'll just have to look at some other device and app to accomplish that. Called the number you provided to other reviews. That told me the connection to the old activity tracker app was now gone. I have a physical job that makes carrying a large $900 phone constantly just so I can count steps risky and unwise. I don't like wrist watches. A $30 pocket tracker was a perfect solution for me.
"I really enjoy the app, does great on tracking and reminders as well as lots of helpful tools, programs, motivation and stats. Just wish it synced with MyFitnessPal better. It's a major struggle to get it synced up and I prefer MFP to track my food and like having all my stats available on MFP."
"Good watch, but app needs to be better. I got this watch for Christmas as my daughter wanted not only to track the basics but to track my sleep and stress as well. I started tracking well and then after a week the app started telling me there were 2 separate records for my sleep and would tell me I slept at least 7 hours, but would record info stats for only 2 of those hours. As for the stress monitoring it states that actually being stressed out has nothing to do with the readings!?"
"Why does this app need access to phone contacts, files, the microphone and the camera to run, selling data much...?"
Doesn't work or load. Useless. I once walked MILES through Manhattan and the app didn't record a single thing. All information is blank as if I don't move daily. And it now just circles and circles and won't load anything at all. I uninstalled it and will need to find something else. A Samsung app not working on a Samsung phone is poor business.
"An excellent health tracker, it works even better with smartwatch integration. I have the Note 9 and a Galaxy Smart Watch as a reference. One thing I would like to see added is more interaction between users in other sports, besides counting steps. Bring on the challenges!"
"It is automatically pausing workouts even when you are running. I am using this app for almost 3 years. This problem is noticed since this week. It is very annoying to listen ""workout paused"" in the middle of your running. Kindly fix the issue."
Since the upgrade I had to reset my location but even after doing this the error message telling me to change location settings won't go away. Really disappointed with the changes you made as I was a keen user interface before this upgrade but now seems to be too many clicks to navigate a set up.
"Is this app only available on samsung's devices? I used to use samsung but I don't anymore, still I love the app but it isn't working anymore. Is that because it is not compatible?"
"its superb app since it gives all important tips, excecise and one can set the goal to achieve the target. It has many programmes to help the excecise and do with them with correct posture. Yoga is there but I think if they can include yoga sessions for regular to follow as they have many other excecise. So many challenges keep coming that gives the competing feel. After looking at the workout they recommend the plan one should follow. Best app to follow. üëç"
"The app is great in gathering information in one place, BUT IT IS TERRIBLE WHEN YOU TRY TO EXPORT THE DATA, the export section needs a makeover, the tables are confusing and missing important information like notes and accurate time stamps for example, there are many issues in the export section which render it useless, if this app receives a decent export menu; then it will be the best."
Overall pretty good. I would love if the step counter could be customized to track steps at certain speeds. For example prevent tracking while driving by detecting steps up to 10km/hr so that it automatically stops if you're going any faster than the set speed.
"I would give this 5 stars but I don't like that I can't add more than one sleep event a day. For example I cannot input a nap, but more importantly for me I have sleep issues and might sleep a few hours, wake up in the middle of the night for a couple hours then go back to sleep. They trick you with the ""record manually* option because you really can't."
"Every update seems to remove features without any reason given. App also contains ads for Samsung products and some meditation services. There's no ""Premium"" service to remove these ads but they aren't too intrusive (yet). Otherwise it's an OK fitness tracking app. @Samsungs reply to my review: Ads for your own products are still ads. I see them for new phones and accessories."
"Getting a 403 error when setting up 2 factor auth. And also, inexplicably, cannot skip that screen."
"this is the best app in Samsung phones, due to the ""together"" tab in this app, i have converted all my family to Samsung users and we check our step count graph compared to each other. this is a simple yet amazing idea, i would like it more if an option to display daily step comparison bar graph is given and if the bar gets updated in the background itself."
"Setup was very frustrating. Verification codes didn't work, twice. 2FA seems to be mandatory, as an error is returned if the negative option to set this up is selected. The backup codes were not selectable and they disappeared when I briefly switched to another app to record them. How do I log out?"
"Used to love it but now it does not work anymore. I walk-jog 7-8km daily by doing 7-8 rounds of a 1km track and start the walking exercise in the app with GPS on before starting to walk. But it marks every km incorrectly. Its a track of even 1km but the app marks every km with sometimes a difference of 300m and sometimes more. And this gets worse when I am running, it marks 1km at 1.5km or more (sometimes 2) even with GPS on when it should be able to track me correctly using the GPS signal."
This app used to be good but the main feature told you whether you were in a calorie deficit and added food to calories lost during workout so you could track calorie consumption accurately. I have searched forum boards and contacted Samsung as it seems many are unhappy that this has been taken off since the recent update but Samsung have emailed and said this feature will not return. App ok otherwise but pointless using if you can not track calories accurately.
This was a great up until the lasted update with the 2 step verification. I can't enjoy the app the same. I put in my number and tried putting the verified code into the box but it wouldn't accept it. I have a Samsung watch and this is the only app that is compatible with it. Just do everyone a favor and change it back to what it was before.
"Ads in the app. The company's level of respect for their users has fallen below any level. I pay a lot of money for your company‚Äôs devices, and in return I see ads(promotions) taking up a lot of screen space in your applications. If I bought a device for $300, then advertising in applications is justified, but I buy a flagship for a bunch of money and see ads, or ""promotions."""
"Great app! Syncs well with my Galaxy Active Watch 2. Tracks steps, floors, calories, workouts, etc. You can also log your food and water intake. It gives you the macros as well. Log your blood glucose, blood oxygen (SpO2) and blood pressure. Measures stress levels and tracks and analyzes sleep. Has built in workouts, breathing exercises and meditations. I highly recommend this app."
"Update ruined everything. Everything was going well than one day, it's no longer syncing with my galaxy 4 watch. I Uninstalled and reinstalled but it's not working. My steps on my watch and my phone are not in sync. I don't know what you guys tried to do with the update but you ruined a good thing."
"Samsung did it again, messed up this app. I can no longer track heart rate, oxygen on my phone (the phone record sensors no longer work) Ever since upgrade in April 2022. To top it off, the Heath Monitor sensor on my Active2 watch no longer works either. As others have stated, pulseOx on phone is just gone, no record button for any of the above on Samsung Health. I am just about to switch to Apple. Please tell me these thongs are being corrected/ replaced."
"Not a bad app. Would be nice if the data could be sync'ed with other fitness apps like LFConnect. I have read the previous versions could. I like the ability to record stress levels. Though would be good to have the SPO as a seperate option, like BP."
"I cannot, under any circumstances, configure the app. It remains stuck at agreeing with the terms and conditions, and just goes back to that screen after I check everything. I have tried uninstalling etc etc. Samsung S9 with latest Android. Help!"
"Whoa, HUGE step back in terms of usefulness. Sure its fine if you want to see your tracking for ONE DAY, but without historical data to compare to, (7days, month, etc) the functionality is USELESS. Please make a fix FAST, or offer a legacy app to replace this pretty, but much MUCH less useful app. No Sa02?, No heart trending? NO BP TRENDING? Not even weight trending. I mean really? How is the person who made this decision still employed?"
"The app was great until this last update. It no longer syncs steps to myfitnesspal. It is reading from it fine. I confirmed the sync settings didn't change. Help correct this please! Update from Myfitnesspal, they are aware of the issue and are working to resolve it. Not direct issue with this app."
"Updates now have the app asking me to detail the kcals of food i wish to add to my list, like the butter i put on my toast. I don't know the kcals! And where has the list of food gone? The only food choices I now have are only ones I've chosen in the past. That's why I'm using the ''latest and greatest'' technology, to do the work for me! Just another time wasting chore, encouraging me to not use the app. It sux."
"This app is trash since they changed your ability to do 1:1 challenges, you were once able to see how many steps your opponent had its no longer available. I used to compete with my husband and as of January 7th this feature is no longer available. I don't even want the app any more. This was the dumbest downgrade they could have done."
"generally, this app is very user friendly. I hate that I cant add most of my workouts since I generally use kettlebells for an all around workout. Trying to find support or a way to suggest that this feature be added is impossible so I figured rating the app might get a response. otherwise, the functionality of it works fine and I like it except for that."
There was once a feature where you could set your weight goal and the app would configure what your calorie intake should be but if you excersized more than the set goal it would add earned calories to your max intake number. The updated app doesnt add earned calories. Its a bit of a bummer. Still a very heplful tool for weight management Great stuff. Thanks.
"This app works really great, but, there's no feature to sync Fitbit to Samsung health for those of us with Fitbit. I know it used to have that feature, but, it looks like y'all took it out. Unless I'm just not finding it. Please bring back syncing between Fitbit and Samsung health!"
"Before the latest update I loved this app, now I get no insight, or notifications. It doesn't seem to load well when I open it, no longer tracks my progress and doesn't seem to connect with my watch. The app worked great before. I am truly disappointed and hope this can be resolved."
I think this watch stresses me out more... is anything even accurate on this thing?!
"For the most part I am very happy with this app. I use this on a Note20 and Active 2 watch. I have no technical issues to speak of. The step count is very accurate and the GPS is exact. The exercises had a couple of issues, but they all went away with the Android OS 13 update. I only wish they had a mountain biking option. Food intake: I wish they would bring back weight mgt. And a UPC scanner for the food entry would be nice, I import food info from Fitbit for now via a 3rd party app."
"Samsung Health is pretty good for what it is, but PLEASE add more ways of finding friends on the Together section. You have to know the username of the person you are looking up in order to connect with them. It would be great if they would integrate facebook or Google so that you can see which of your friends already use it. I would use it much more if i could easily find more friends to challenge. 5 stars if you can make this happen."
Not able to modify DOB after installing the app!
Suspected issue with location/GPS. App was crashing. Thanks to Elizabeth at Samsung Support (Online Chat) followed advice to fix. Backup account (sync and download) for safety. Disable App and reinstall. Resync. Update to current version. All now working fine again. Years worth of data restored to full order. Thank-you. ‚ò∫
"I liked this app. up until this latest update. Even though you say having access to my phone and contacts helps improve the app. I can't see how this is true. Maybe if you explain why you need access more than just""optimal experience"" or what are these ""unique device identifiers"" it would help in understanding. It would also be nice to have the option to opt out of those features to still use the features you do like! I don't usually review apps, but I feel strongly this request is unreasonable."
"Updated: 09/19/20 (Note 8) - Samsung Health has been my absolute favorite go-to fitness app over the last 6 or 7 years. My experience: 5-star = 7 yrs. Late 2018 to early 2019 = 2 Stars. After recent updates = 4 Stars. You're on your way back to 5 Stars. I will say no other fitness apps compare. TY for that. There is still no Rebounder (Trampoline) tracker under exercise? I've been waiting years for this add, to be able to track my bounce from my watch. Please add this. Thanks"
Update* previous issue has still not been resolved. Can not clear step count notification. Love the app but when it updated recently I'm getting a steps notification and it will not clear it unless I turn off all notifications which I don't want to doüôÑüôÑPlease fix this!!! I should not have to call anyone to get this fixed either. There are several other people with the same issue so it should just be done.
"I used to love this app. it stored all my health data for my doctor visits and kept me motivated then they did an update all of my data was lost, I often have to then off my my phone ad reboot to get the app to work I have done several virus scans that were clean. it repeatedly pauses during the middle of my run. HORRIBLE APP"
It's infuriatingly inconsistent when trying to track your progress. I'll go on an hour walk and just because I take a left turn the app breaks each into another walk so I'm left with 4 15 min sections of inaccuracies. When running as it can't understand taking a 1 minute walking break half way through a run and so instead of measuring it as say a 20 min run with a 1 min walk it just reduces my average speed and says I've been on 2 runs. Today it didn't even capture the second half of my run.
Update: Still no way to view my progress in weight loss. Could you make a way to export my data and ill use a different app? Super cool app until they made updates earlier this month. I track my weight and there used to be a feature to see you min/max/average weight for each week or month. Now they only show individual days.... Update: Yay you fixed it! Will change to 5 if all goes well
"We really need a ""step counter that starts immediately w/out turning on a workout"" option. I'm walking consistently, for SHORT amounts of time, back and forth short distances with regular pauses at different locations in the same small room. I still want to know how far I've walked."
"it was ok, but several days when I write something for 2 hours suddenly I see in the app that I had a nap. And I am not able to remove it! Is it a good idea to let people change such data?! I am writing the article and SHealth suddenly says that I am sleeping for 2 hours. Surprise!!! It makes app almost useless for me. I need to control my sleeping habits and if app is not able to recognize even when people are sleeping and when not, at least give users possibility to fix it manually."
"Used to be a great app. But they removed a very important function. I can no longer find the SPO2 sensor which showed my heartbeat and Oxygen level. These were very helpful because of arrhythmia. The app is now worthless to me. I read comments that it had been moved to another place in the app, but i can't find it. WORTHLESS APP. RATE IT ZERO!"
"I am using an One Plus 6T phone and am having challenges in syncing data from watch to phone.. it doesn't sync even after repeated tries.. have tried switching on/off WiFi, BT and even the phone itself and no results. The MiBand that inused earlier had a much faster and simpler sync! Can the developers look into this please?"
"If it is possible, it would be awesome to see how many steps were done during the individual intervals throughout the day without having to do the goal tracker. Also, the messages of try taking a walk and such make me feel awful when I'm having a bad day and cannot walk much (I'm disabled) and especially now that I have had ankle surgery and cannot walk. I understand the reasoning to motive people, but it can be detrimental to mental health for some."
"Worked great for the basics I used it for for years, updated last week and now won't even open. Uninstall and re-install and now it asks for permissions it didn't need before. Didn't even go farther to see if it even worked. Don't know why it needs permissions to manage my calls?? Explanation would be great on that one. Since I couldn't open it for 2 weeks idk if it's even any good any more. Galaxy s20FE."
"Broken. stuck spinning on every option and not a single step being recorded. I can't even change my name because it just stays on a loading screen. Update: Have now cleared cache, signed in through samsung and restarted. Exact same issues. Just spinning circles and not a single sign of progress being saved"
"FRUSTRATED ! I really like this app and use it daily. But suddenly my FAVS and MY FOODS list don't populate...there's just a blank page ! I'm able to search for foods and they will show up as favorites, but this is too time consuming to do every time. I've been using this app for a long time to count macros and so my favs and my foods make the process less time consuming. So, where the heck did the lists go ? Uggh. :-("
"I wish there were some design options for always on display support, when cycling."
"I love this app. Its food tracking and calorie counting is amazing. There are 2 reasons I gave it a 4 star and not a 5 1. It is not compatible with my Garmin vivofit 3 fitness tracking watch. 2. I can't manually put in calories I burned during excersise from a work out machine. I need to chose the exercise and wait until the counter reaches the calories I burned. 3. One or two item's nutrition information was incorrect, but overall it is correct. That is about it. The rest of it I love a lot."
"Calorie tracker is gone. I don't like the new color scheme. The recommended and actual intake for nutrients is too hard to read and the lime green color gives me anxiety. Please undo these changes and put everything back the way you found it. I'm thinking of using a different app now. Take out the ads above the step counter too, and I might reconsider. Update: please STOP MESSING WITH THE UI AND BRING BACK THE FUNCTIONALITY WE ARE ALL ASKING FOR!!!"
"New privacy policy. I don't agree with it - less privacy for me with samsung trying to cover itself legally when combining the data. So the app doesn't work anymore, I can't use an older version without sideloading, I can't use my galaxy watch to its full functionality either. This is a shame! You can't keep your existing functionality for which you've paid for because someone decided to become a creep."
"Quality continually gets worse every few months / after every update. It can no longer be opened because it hangs on an ""accept privacy agreement"" screen. Reverting back to a prior version from a few years ago would add back both more features and stability."
"I seem to be missing features such as stress tracker. I have Samsung galaxy s9 and a samsung galaxy watch. It's not on either of them and from what I can see it should be. Also, the app needs to be more in depth like the fitbit app. But overall it's a good app."
"I really like this app with the exception that it does not provide the total time it takes to reach your goal. Surely it is not that hard to add this feature to the app? It could say something like "" You have reached your goal distance of 10km in 1 hour 22 mins and 16 seconds."" The app has been updated to provide the duration to goal time. Thanks guys"
"I use the Samsung galaxy watch active and sync it to s health. I could not find one very important feature in this app, which is provided by mi fit, fitbit and strava i.e. the accumulated results of distance, steps, calories floors CANNOT be seen for a period say a month or a week. While the app provides seamless and great stats on dialy steps, distance, floors and calories, the accumulated results of distance, steps, calories floors CANNOT be seen. Can this be fixed?"
"I use dark mode on my phone and the apps colours make it really hard to use. The colors selected for the charts and infographics are really bad. In the workout section: it used to be a blue trendline to show your speed during walks and runs. Now it's a translucent blue. I can't see anything In the foods section the colour for fats and carbs is the same I really like this app, but this new update sucks. I don't know what your PM's or designers were thinking. Fire the intern that pushed this"
"These are the worst Fitness apps ever. Not only does it draining a lot of battery power, but it does not monitor sleep at all, activities in the application do not agree with reality and when I want to enter sleep activity manually, the Save button does not work. There's nothing wrong. I own Galaxy Active 2, version 4G, and there are significantly better and cheaper products on the market."
Worst update ever. It freezes often. Does not record my exercises. UI is very confusing. Bring back the previous version. I am extremely unhappy. If I restart the phone it takes hours for samsung health to initialise. During this time it won't record anything.
"I can no longer use the heart rate and stress sensors. Very upsetting. Tried uninstalling and reinstalled, still didn't work and I lost 5 months of my health data. I was considering buying the new galaxy watch, but why would I if Samsung Health has stopped working. Edit to add: The directions are to contact Samsung in the app settings>help>contact us, but the link gives a bad request message. I can't even contact Samsung to get help with this problem."
I've been using this app for years but the latest update has removed some features I referred to a lot. I can input and compare weight on a day-to-day basis but the weekly/monthly overview has gone. Food and exercise is no longer linked - this was a really useful feature. Is there any way of restoring these functions?
"I am very upset i used a lot of the removed features on the app like oxygen level, stress, and heart rate, glucose level, and weight management. I have to say it was very disappointing to see when I got my phone that it has all changed and the features I loved are gone."
"I used the app to track my steps and heart rate post work out but since the new update i can't see any of my data because when i click the app it asks me to agree to terms and services and when i do it simply says ""unknown error 0x2A#0"" then it kicks me out of the app. It sucks because like it was a good app and now i can't even access it. The email on the contact list for the app is a do not reply email so like the hell Samsung."
"It's amazing... when it works. Which I guess is kind of most of the time. Sometimes I'll go on a bike ride and it doesn't record my route so when I'm done it'll show that I was riding for over an hour but only did 1.43 miles, yet my husband's phone shows over 11 miles and we rode together üòí. Not sure if I need an update or what but it used to work fine and then for some reason it just stopped recording my routes"
Excellent app with a Good range of workout routines. Been using this a lot to track my daily walking exercise. Edit: the community feature is now removed from the app which you can use to share challenges and earn xp so I deducted a star. I wish they bring it back with moderators to stop spammers. Being able to see others exercises is a good source of motivation for me.
"It was a great app. Always crashes now. For last 48 hours, if I go for a cycle my Samsung watch records all the details but when you go on recent activity to view it, the app used to show you route etc. That's now blank and within 10 secs the app crashes. I have sent feedback logs etc. Please sort this out."
"Not as accurate as it should be; being a tracker. It senses when I am asleep, but not when I am awake. I have been awake for hours working only to find out that I am still being recorded as though I am asleep and I cannot edit that. Not to mention if I am up and working how does it detect me in REM sleep or worse, deep sleep. The features and abilities are cool, but only if they are accurate, so the info provided should be taken with a grain of salt and cannot really be used for doc info either."
"Update: The app doesn't seem to have any battery issues on my new phone (Pixel 4a 5G). I increased the rating only by one star because I find that I just don't use the app. Original Review: The app has a nice feature set and a well-designed UI, but it's not so good when it comes to battery usage (on the Moto Z Play). I tried running the app with minimal permissions, and just about every option turned off, but none of that seemed to help."
"I love the idea but am having major problems with it. Now that, with the aid of a rollator (wheelie walker), I can walk for exercise it is recording strange data. Without reaching my best walking pace it thinks I am running (I wish!) I have just done a 2.5km walk plus a very little in town and it is recording over 6km. Can this be rectified to a more realistic measuring?"
"I love this app!! Its been a great addition to my life, especially the nutrition part. I never really understood how much of each nutrient I was putting in my body and how little or two much i was adding to it. With the help of the Samsung health app I'm able to have balance meal everyday. And with it tracking all my meals I know weather or not to double up on protien or eat more fruit depending on what I've already that day. Not to mention the it also keeps track of your excercises!! üëç"
I love the app BUT I woke up this morning and the app will not count my steps! I use it all the time to count my steps and track my blood pressure and weight loss. Tried everything that was asked to do. Nothing worked. I contacted Samsung after reseting my phone to factory settings and still have no pedometer... figured out that the gyro sensor is bad in my phone
I am very disappointed in what this app has become. For years I have been tracking my health. Every couple years I would upgrade my phone knowing I would have the needed features. But no with this upgrade they have taken away needed essentials used in my tracking. This app has lost favor with me. I am looking for something new. One star only for posting.
"Hi. I love the app and find it very useful to motivate you to be more active. 1 issue I have found though is that my walks are being recorded as 12 hours earlier. For example, if I go for a walk at 4pm it shows on the graph as 4am, is there a fix for this?"
It's alright but: I switched to Samsung after my fitbit broke. This is almost the same with better phone connectivity however it is MISSING games! Fitbit didn't have a whole lot but there were pedometer games. Make my steps into points or coins or levels and I'll stick with you. If not I'll probably go back to Fitbit when they make a new one.
Good platforms to count your ability to fit
"This app has not been counting ANY of my steps since the last update. I have uninstalled and reinstalled, cleared the cache, and checked the permissions. Everything says it should be working, but still there are NO steps counted at all. What the heck happened with the last update? At this rate I'm going to uninstall the app and get a different one."
"Last update removed the weight management feature and that was THE most useful function. Some people struggle to eat ENOUGH so this was really really important. And just a heads up for anyone who is green colour blind, but they've now changed the bars to various shades of green. Whose idea was that? Deleted the app, what's the point in having it anymore? Really disappointed. RESPONSE TO SAMSUNG: I am not experiencing an issue. Your design team made the conscious decision to change said features."
"it is very nice app,counting steps accurate well. But it is counting a lot of steps during vehicle journey like bus/car etc and count is going wrong. so, if any short cut like homescreen shortcut/floating icon/pause button in widget/quick notification is available to pause&start the counting&also for switching between waking mode, running mode,cycling mode & more, the app usage can be more easier"
"Gone downhill. Weight, ok Percentage body fat, ok Hydration is now included, but in kg which is not convenient. Need percentage which is immediately obvious that it has changed regardless of total weight. To get hydration I have to input muscle mass and bone mass, instead of reading it directly from my scales. Used to show a combined graph, making it easy to see if weight change was related to body fat change - now have to swap displays."
"Mediocre... I use this app to track my runs but after updates the app just keeps getting worse in the middle of running it says workout paused about 10 times or more when I haven't stopped, extremely frustrating. Trying to re download it now to see if that fixes the problem. Doubtful...."
This app crashes EVERY SINGLE DAY on a a51 thats less than a month old. I thought it was from using the tracked exercise feature so I was using the pedometer only. Nope. Still crashes every single day. Edit: Why do I need to contact you when its your app that you made that doesn't work? I'm not the only person with this issue. I shouldn't have to restart my phone sometimes twice a day because your app is glitchy
"The app in itself is ok however there are certain apps on my phone which causes the Samsung health app to crash and also crashes the app that was open, for example, Facebook, wordscapes and a few others, it is extremely frustrating, I don't want to have to delete this app or others, but I may have too unless it can be fixed."
I feel like the step counter is more sensitive now after the update. I feel like it is counting movements or distance while I'm driving. I never had this problem before the update. I also feel like the calorie counter is very inaccurate. I know it's an estimate but it was very unbelievable. This was my go to step counter and physical activity tracker. But now after the update I'm very disappointed with this app.
"Great app and helping me lose weight by making things simple. As of recently however, the RDA values seem to all be set to zero for some reason, not allowing me to track my protein, fibre etc as they all appear green regardless. Could do with a fix and will bump up to 5 stars when fixed."
Pretty good. Enjoy looking at the statistics and graphs. Would be great if it could sync with apps such as Strong - would be cool to see heart rate alongside workouts.
Spammers use the challenge system to send messages. I recieve messages like this constantly. They cancel the challenge so it can't be reported. Extremely pornographic messages are sent. The app itself is also quite bad without this security issue. Response: There are multiple spammers and they cancel the challenge so you are unable to block them.
"I really like this app and the challenges it keeps me on track and motivated!! What I don't like is when you wake up the total steps count changesüò° Yesterday it said 45,000 total steps and now it says 39,000! I'm still leading in my challenge but my steps were taking away why??? Can you fix this?"
Samsung health app would be great if they added barcode scan to the food section instead of typing in every food item.
"I love the app and for the most part I like my Galaxy Active 2 watch. HOWEVER, I specifically bought the watch because I wanted more accurate calorie counts with my workouts thinking that the watch would use a basic formula with my heart rate to calculate it. It doesn't do that at all. It doesn't matter the intensity of your workout, it only bases the calories on duration and your weight/height. Samsung PLEASE update this!!! I want my watch with the name ACTIVE in it to give me accurate information about my activity."
"Everything used to be absolutely wonderful. Now Health doesn't see my watch. It says ""No wearable devices connected"". I have tried rebooting my watch & phone, unpairing & then re-pairing. I have also cleared the cache. The auto-sync is turned on. I was going to uninstall then reinstall Health, but do not see the option. PLEASE HELP!!!"
"While the step counter and automatic exercise tracker functions are great, this app will not allow you to edit the sleep time and does not track this well. If you read before bed (or at anytime during the day) it will mark that time as you being asleep. Unless the app marks the extra time as a nap, you cannot delete it."
"Always used this App. Find it convenient as it runs in the background, and there's no need to start/end it, etc Now it's stuck on over 10,000 steps and hasn't reset in weeks! Waiting for an update in the hope it will sort itself out, but really disappointed Please sort ASAP , I don't want to install another app üò´"
"I like this APP overall; however, it seems when updates are installed on my Samsung phone, this Samsung APP does not function accurately. I've used this APP a lot over the last couple of years. Lost vital info due to reinstalling. I rely a lot on this for my health and to show my Doctors. It really sucks when it does not work properly, like today, the oxygen stress is not working and shuts down APP. I use this to keep track of my oxygen as it is as accurate as our ER finger reader."
"Great app!!!....who needs a Fitbit!!! The only thing I would comment on is that the kilometres that you walk which is recorded in your set workout, is always outof sync compared to the total summary that you've completed on the main page. For example on 2 of my walks today I totalled 6.67kms for the two workouts. But on the main Samsung health page it says I did 7.45kms total today."
"Not an accurate fitness tracker. Multiple times I was running on the treadmill and the no of steps shown was 2200 and the distance was shown as just 0.22km. On top of that it skips heart rate measurement during intense training sessions and shows that the heart rate that was measured was much lower than the actual heart rate. I have tried everything, changing the band, securing a tight fit and strapping the watch up at a higher level on my wrist. Nothing works. Not even rebooting the watch"
"I love the app! I love how it has very helpful information in the weekly articles. From what types of foods to eat to lose belly fat to what types to eat to gain weight. I ran track in high school, but short distances. But, since I do not run short distances anymore. In the app there's a ""Baby steps to 5K"" program. That help me build up my long distance running. Only down fall I have is the app use to be supported by Bixby and it is not anymore. Please, address the issue. Thanks, Samsung!"
Missing total step distance so I've switched back to tomtom and will go to Garmin when it's no longer supported...shame Samsung Health had it before but you removed it. A lot of people including myself use monthly total activity and step distance for third party challenges. Time to say goodbye. X Thanks for getting back to me Samsung but phoning you won't bring these features back...
"Freezes several times during 1- hr workout. Was a solid app prior to the last update in September. Now it's pretty terrible in terms of the interface, very unstable, and buggy (take a look at weekly summary where there's no breakdown by daily activity anymore)."
"This app does not track sleep correctly. Often records the wrong bedtime, with no way to edit, even though the option is there! Update 11/14/20 This app really sucks worse now. It gets gaps in sleep times. Records sleep beginning at say 9:30 pm and stops it at midnight then adds it to that same days total, then starts again randomly. Still no way to edit sleep, just erase it. Terrible, I have had Garmin and fitbits and the sleep tracking part of their app blows this completely away."
I have been using this app along with a gear s 3 watch for 2 years. I live in a 2 story house and am up and down all day. the system never records over 1 floor. sleep record is terrible after last update. if I'm working at my desk it thinks I'm sleeping. I rolled paint for 8 hours. It said I exercised 30 minutes. In 2 years I have lived through several watch updates. The watch is good for telling time. Don't get your hopes up for much more. The health app is no more accurate than a ouija board.
"Updated app, slepp data metrics haven't populated on my phone app since 10/2. I called Samsung support, went through the steps, cleared cache and data, uninstalled app, restarted devices. It restored data but did not populate metrics from 10/2 until now. My watch recorded the data, it is not showing on my phone. Also, why did you change from a dark background to a white one? Much harder on the eyes. At least give option for dark mode on app please."
"I like the app, but starting on March 12, 2021 my sleep isn't tracking from my Galaxy watch anymore. I now have to look at my watch to see when I slept and manually enter it into my phone. It still tracks everything else from my watch (heart rate, exercise, etc) just not sleep. I called the number you provided on other posts, but nothing we did helped. I would really like my sleep to communicate to my phone again. I find this feature very useful. *Update* on 4/8/2021 seems to have fixed issue üòä"
"Great until recently, Steps Count. It would appear that the Samsung Galaxy Watch by and a Samsung phone no longer work together in harmony Samsung health settings you used to be able to define either the phone or the Watch to record steps. I have only recently noticed this myself but have seen lots of other comments on the web The settings have lost the device option to choose, now records both the phone and the watch so if you have both with you it doubles the steps. Emailed also Please resolve"
"Until today I really loved this app. Simple. Informative. Useful. Now I need to allow access to my contacts to continue using it. Poor form. I will look for an alternative app. I also don't recall seeing any notice about this happening, so I was unable to export any data."
the app works fine for the majority of the time but for the 3rd time the exercise one has frozen & keeps closing the app down. I was recording my walking but when I tried to stop it the app wouldn't do anything. if I yet again have to re-install it I will once again lose all my recorded data. Is there a resolution for this without losing it all?
"I've used this app for years and have found it useful. I now need to track vitamins, supplements, and medicines with meals or in between meals. It would be great if you will add a pill or supplement tracker or include an add-on app that works with Samsung Health. I prefer to track everything with one app. If you can add this feature, make certain users have the ability to customize the medicine name so that users can maintain privacy."
"Since the last update th steps and distance trackers are way off: -my usual 5km and 10km runs are being counted as 0.5km and 1.3km respectively which is totally wrong -the audio guide is almost none existant (doesnt alert that the warm up period is over and the real run will begin in a minute or 2 like it used to, it doesnt give comments on your speed and distance like it used to) Now you are in your own while using this app but it use to be more interactive."
"Pretty cool. I'm no power user, but without much fuss I can track a lot of health metrics. Tracking data while on a hike is easy & fun, but the sleep & snoring data is especially interesting. My wife uses the Oura ring, so we can compare our data and the apps; she's got the better deal for health monitoring, I've decided, but the Watch has so much more broadscale functionality, so ymmv. Problem; Samsung Health is not calculating my sleep score properly; today it ignored my REM entirely. Weird."
Not happy with the update now the audio coach is not working. It helped me a lot last year to keep track of my running activities and distance. Now I can't hear it and I think it's the audio update that sumsung pushed down my throat. Thanks I gave you 5 stars because of your incredible work and amazing service. But pleas fix the problem
"At first I considered this a gimmick. After using it for a month, I discovered that it is addicting. In addition to that, it hints, makes suggestions that you should stretch, move around, etc. Then I discovered the Global goal. It is clever and it motivates you."
"Latest update removed useful features like calorie management that I used daily. Being able to *only* track calories without seeing the overall picture regarding caloric intake disempowers the user by depriving them of useful information. I want to give this app 4 stars, but I'm removing 2 stars due to the removal of useful features and the inclusion of ads."
"I used to love this app, it helped me lose weight and now maintain that weight, however now the Weight Management feature has been taken away it's harder for me to continually use. I would really love if you brought the Weight Management feature back!! I just have stopped using it since this feature has been taken away because it was the main reason I used it. Please bring back weight management."
"Terrible now best features turned off, I used this with my fitbit, and a 3rd party app to update steps. Samsung in their wisdom have disabled the 3rd party integration to force us to use their approved trackers. well Samsung I have news for you, this has annoyed me to the extent I will not buy another Samsung phone. If I could uninstall the app I would, I will find and use an alternative App."
This app was very good at one point. Until they took out the most beneficial function ... weight management traking. This was a section where you could visually keep track of your calorific balance for the day. I used this to lose a lot of weight. Now its all haphazard. It seems a lot of users have complained about this but the developers are not even bothering to take this on board.
"I love using this app with my Samsung watch. The only thing that prevents me from giving this a 5 star is something I wish this app would have. A period tracker for women! This is apart of our lives. We have it, and sometimes it's bad. Sometimes its heavy, and sometimes it's alright. And tracking those days are good to have to take to a doctor to figure out if there are issues. I like keeping all my stuff together in 1 app. And to have that in there would make life a lot easier. That, and I can see trends between my activity level and days on on. That's just an idea I had. I doubt that my review would honestly be read by Samsung. But hey! This is just my idea and I feel like it would help a lot of women."
"Heart rate is inaccurate! and measuring mostly by the first second, not by the 15-20 seconds of the measure and doesn't realy change/adapt during the measure. Should display the average rate also, not only the realtime. And what's up with the moods names? Why not enable the user to be able to edit the names? Most of the mood names are not usfull and are frankly stupid. Try adding ""after shower, meal, toilet, meds etc"". Let the user choose or edit the names and get rid of those stupid smiles. The app refuses to pair up with my Xiaomi smart scale v2. I wrote ""refuse"" because it did read scale data before i tried to pair it or installing Xiaomi mi fit. The device shows up in the device list and is recognized but fail to pair. Removing it from BT devices or Xiaomi mi fit didn't help. The previous style was much more convenient and it took less clicks to get to the heart rate & steps data. I like new desind and innovation but the new style is a disaster. I need to click as twice to get to the heart rate & steps data. Clearly the developers don't use the app or any health app. Searching for the old apk version..."
over all experience is good. I wish samsung provides a user configurable calorie burn target which can be monitored on weekly basis for meeting target. I am also seeing one error in the app is - calorie count shown in the total steps daily basis does not match with count shows from treadmil walk. Treadmil walk shows more calorie then steps counter shows. Not sure which one is correct.
Luv the coaching features & multi-activity tracking. The monthly challenges are a brilliant way to keep self motivated.. 3 stars because of below 2 issues: 1. ByThe top rankers in the challenges are SUPPOSEDLY doing more than 1lakh steps DAILY!! How's that possible???? 2. App keeps closing..Have to open it separately to ensure watch steps are getting synced correctly. Why can't it be like Mi Fit??
I usually love my Samsung Health app. I've been using it for years! But lately there's a glitch with the sleep tracking where it won't show me the graphical breakdown of my sleep or the detail about how much time is spent in each phase throughout the night. It especially has problems when there are multiple cycles due to waking up (regularly). This is important to me and I'd like to see it resolved. I watch my sleep cycles closely but can't improve my health if I don't know this detail.
"the app is ok, however there are still many glitches that can be improved; when I started using the app it wasn't counting steps too well but now its getting better, the biggest bug for me personally is the stairs and calories count- those 2 are average to say the list. Other than that it's great."
Update: I finally got everything synced and working. Then there was a new privacy update that included me showing Samsung access to all my contacts. No. I use this as a way to keep up with my health and you don't need access to my contacts for that. So. I uninstalled the app. Too invasive.
Key measurements like heart rate only recordable if you have their watch. Can not manually enter. Very fraudulent.
Ive resolved this issue. This update can wipe your samsung health data permissions. To resolve you will either need to clear data and cache then uninstall and re install so the app will go through the reconnect process. For apps that you can toggle the connection on and off like myfitness pal you just need to turn the connection off then on again and you can reconnect. Data no longer shared to 3rd party apps since this update nothing can connect with Samsung Health.
"3rd version of this app... still get 100% o2 every time...one of the reasons i wanted it üòï can be walking around with phone and next morning it will say i was asleep. good that manual adds can be done, only way some data is acurate. it does do heart rate well. update... seems the latest update has tweaked the pedometer... so now when i walk more it records less! have been walking around with it this morning...zero steps recorded. the only thing it can do now it seems is heart rate, and even tha"
"They changed the sleep time selector now it is ugly and hard to use , the circle like selector was so much easier."
overall great app. Having a barcode reader would be nice. When I go look up the foods I am eating the nutrition information is not completely accurate. I end up either putting the info in manually or upping the serving size to make sure I have a good count of calories and carbs intake.
"The stars in the monthly challenge starts to fade after some time. For girls it is harder to do their exercises like running when they are on their periods as compared to normal days. As a result they are unable to walk a particular amount of steps and are unable to reach the stars in time. My advice is to remove the timer on the stars so that after a week when our periods end, we can still achieve those stars. Since the stars are a bit of motivation to achieve our desired goals."
"Ok, I'm triggered how long it takes to fix seemingly simple yet supper annoying bug. On my every run, my TOP speed is lower than my average (same with pace) ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Seen this reported across Samsung forums yet no fix in sight. OLD REVIEW:Super useful app. There are some minor things that I would love for them to fix. But over all - brilliant."
"With latest watch update (active 2), all my running and walking data has been lost on my note 9 Samsung Health app. Only other workouts are listed. all data is still on my watch. For example, it is saying I exercised 3 days this week when I actually exercised 6 days. All running and walking data from as far back as I dared to look, have been erased Update: I spoke with Samsung customer service and they resolved the issue. Thanks Samsung. I have updated from one star to five stars."
"What happened to voice guide while you running? It is not working anymore. I use to be able to track the progress,time,pace,heart rate while running every given distance half mile,mile or whatever distance I set but it is not working anymore. Very disappointing..."
"[Update] Thank you for reaching out! After resetting the wristband entirely, it works now. But it is a bit annoying that I had to do so. [Original] Does not sync with my Galaxy Fit e correctly. Reopening the app or rebooting the phone as well as restarting the wristband does not solve the issue."
It stopped syncing with my galaxy gear 2 watch. But the gear 2 showed up as an accessory. I cannot find how to remove the accessory from Samsung health. While Internet also cannot find. I went into Samsung account and removed my watch from the accessory and still it showed up in Samsung health. I unpaired my watch from my phone and uninstall Samsung health thinking that I can install back. Went to playstore to install and stuck between 82% to 86% for more than 10 mins each time. Give up.
"App is quite good. The only issue I have is that the sleep tracker sometimes doesn't record anything for days. Other times notifications about my sleep come in the afternoon. I'm currently using a Samsung note 9. The sleep tracker used to be very reliable with my previous Samsung devices. Immediately I picked up my phone I would get a notification about my sleep. Now, I hardly get any notification or record."
"App will not sync and will not show steps or any data. I Changed settings. Updated. Restarted device. Nothing works. This has been going on for the last few days. Too bad because it's a useful app. Please fix. Samsung A71 device. Uninstalled app and re installed, steps now work again."
"I was able to use this app to measure blood oxygen and heart rate. Recently, i noticed app is not functioning well and has stopped to measure both functions. So i uninstalled and reinstalled the app. Now, option of measuring both functions have been completely removed from the app."
"Yoo took a really good app and screwed it up just for the sake of change. Weight management was truly useful for inspiring change as the day progressed. Several other changes were also not for the better. Do us all a favor, admit you really screwed the pooch on this So called update and give us the previous version back."
"I have used this app for years and i love everything about it, but for some time now(4-5 weeks) i can' t open it anymore! The loading screen appears, but the next second it says ""FOR YOUR PHONE SAFETY THIS APP CAN'T BE OPEN"" and it shuts. Though, i still get notifications every day about my step target or minutes of activity. I really want to find a way to fix this."
"I enjoyed this app, but I am not giving it permission to make calls so I have had to stop using it. I saw the response, that the app will not make calls, but I am not prepared to give it the option. Too great a security risk - and also the risk of call charges if it does every use that option - whether through error, malicious use or policy change."
I really enjoy using this app to track my caloric intake. It's very detailed and provides an excellent breakdown of my diet. However I do wish the detail section of the food tracker would also display sugar and carb breakdown. I think being able to manually change the percent of macros consumed would be nice for those who are trying certain diets. A bar code scanner would make this app 5 stars.
"The phone app won't synch with the Galaxy 3 watch for step counting. Also, glad they finally put period tracking but it loses all of your information every time anything updates on your phone so its basically useless in the long run if you're tracking your period to avoid or achieve pregnancy then you need to use a separate more reliable app."
"I have been using this app for years. Alot of changes, some great, some not so great. This last update though, sorry but it's garbage now. Sleep score instead of percent? Why?? And all the extra graphics are just mudding up the appearance. I'm actually kind of upset about this. Go back to 6 months ago please."
Paying for Spotify premium but can't use Spotify and track my workout at the same time. Offline downloaded playlists don't play at all. Have music playing and open Samsung Health = music stops and won't start again. Start a workout and start playing music = Samsung health quits and i lose track of the workout. Pathetic customer treatment and service - I don't won't to make an INTERNATIONAL PHONECALL to fix my premium devices. I would rate this 0/5 if I could.
The watch doesnt sync correctly and shows different number of steps on the watch and other number on the app
"Ever since i got the newest software update (9.0) the app keeps opening up by itself and saying ""for your security, samsung health cannot be opened on a rooted phone "". I don't understand why its saying that, I don't even have a computer to be able to root my phone, nor have i actually tried messing with my phone like that at all. The only solution to stop the random opening (would reopen twice every few minutes) was to uninstall the app. PLEASE HELP!!!!!"
"When I first got the app I loved it! With each update things are being eliminated. It doesn't seem to work with my wearable anymore, the barcode for the food is gone, now my sensor won't work for checking heart rate. If it's not fixed soon I will eliminate it and move to another app."
"I am having the same issue as Joris Van Der Burgh a little further down. Since the update today I am unable to switch the step counter off without switching off all notifications, which I didn't want to do. When I go into notifications on the app the option to switch badges off is low lit, therefore it is on when all notifications are on off when off. Can you please resolve as this has only been done since the update"
"Update hides micronutrient counts. I used to use the app to track my net carbs, but now instead of having the micronutrient numbers under the macros it's just a graph, and I have to dig down in another menu to get the numbers. This adds extra mental steps to the calculation, and makes the app overall less accessible."
"Great but maybe add a custom workout routine option vs the ""other"" option that waybwe can further customize which routine, program we did during that time. I do allot of different workout routines as a Trainor for beach body workouts with small groups and the app with a watch is great at tracking heart rate, calories burned, etc...but when you select other, the only way to really know which workout was what is if you place it in the notes So a the ability to create some sort of title would rock"
"It's a good app, but I had to reinstall and when I synchronized the app with my account, none of my previous information was uploaded. This matters because I have the app connected with achievement. I reinstalled because there was a sync issue for the last several weeks between the apps."
"Galaxy Watch: Why was the Guide Frequency removed from the ""running"" exercise? Now you only find it under ""walking"". One can't determine the average pace per kilometer, time and kilometers completed. It is so frustrating because you can only determine these indicators by havingnto look at the screen and that slows down pace. Why was this really taken out?"
"You need a Samsung account in order to use the smartphone's built-in heart rate sensor on the newer version. What a horrendous turn of events Samsung!!! This app used to work and now its stuck behind a sign-in barrier. I recommend everyone to revert back to version 6.12.1.001, using an apk website that has this version. Version 6.12.1.001 has the stress checking as well. My review isn't in the latest version filter, because I forgot to review it, before reverting back to the older version."
"Seems like it would be nice, but it has crashed almost every other day (even when I don't use it). I decided to start using it since I have the watch, but it is so slow, it is extremely frustrating hitting the wrong button and having to wait forever for the app to catch up. Update did nothing to help. I'd really like to use it, but I'd rather not lose my patience."
I updated my app a day ago and now the heart rate monitor seems to not be working. The reading remained stagnant for long periods during a workout. The calorie counter is also faulty and just relies on duration of the workout. These used to work really well but the recent update is quite disappointing.
"Hey, love the improvements y'all have made!! Can you pls also add the ability to favorite or bookmark fitness programs? Also it would be cool if, in the future, you're able to make it more inclusive regarding disability. Find fitness experts that can provide programs for certain limitations. A physical therapist would be helpful as well; versed in chronic pain/illness, they could teach how to properly use therapeutic exercises techniques, offer guidance on stretching if you have a pinched nerve."
"Works great with my Galaxy Watch Active2, easy to use and good range of fitness activity tracking. I would have given it 5 stars except for one major omission in its Hiking tracker. The Hiking tracker records highest elevation but one key metric for hikers is total ascent and descent on a hike which will typically be greater than the highest elevation achieved, This should be easy enough to add and would complete the Hiking tracker."
"Good for logging things, but not many prompts to log, horrible at auto detecting activity. Did a 6 hour hike with it in my pants pocket and it detected three 15 min intervals of it all. It also isnt compatible to many other health and fitness apps such as alltrails. If it was connected to alltrails itd have my true active time, and what level of exercise i was getting. Itd be cool if theyd do notifications on real good ways to stay healthy and active other than recommending me take a walk."
"Used to be a great app. About 10 days ago it quit working properly, barely records steps, some days not at all. I updated app, still wouldn't work, uninstalled and re-installed from app store. Now I've lost all previous data. And it still doesnt work."
"Overall its been very helpful for helping me make sure i eat enough calories(before i thought I was over eating. turns out i was under eating) and its also helped encourage me to be more active and celebrate the little achievements. i do wish they would add more exercises to keep track of. some of the ones i do, like arm circles for example, arent on there and id really like to be able to track them as well."
I use to love this app now I only kind of like it. The Sp02 should have been retained as a separate option. I appreciate that it continues to be available under stress management but the stand alone option for tracking was one of my most used and favorite features. It's removal has made the app less useful.
"Stay away from Samsung watches. It used to be perfect, but an update completely ruined how useful it was. The calories it shows burned are now harder to track and not even accurate according to other sites. Other useful graphs now gone. It's only use now is to track heart rate and timers. I plan on either selling my watch or just throwing it out. Samsung never even commented on why they downgraded the app. Honestly, get a different watch."
"Good design but not accurate. I always check at the end of the day. it always says (for e.g.) i walked 8km and have lost 2000 calories. This is not accurate. i did walk 8km, i weight 85kg. i should of burnt just over 500 calories. im baffled why the app says i lost 2000. I think as a app, design its great. but the information and result is wrong. i like the app and hope it gets accurate"
"Best app to set goals for weight/health management. Works best w/android, less features for apple. Your phone is all you need & dont need added hardware. But a GOOD (not cheap) smart/health watch used with this app would improve accuracy. Lost 40 lbs in 40 days with the assistance of this app to keep track & read labels for food, as well as set exercise goals. Option to keep track of your walks stink dur to bad gps/route accuracy, but I use another app and enter in stuff manually."
"Requires use of phone calls. Hard NO. Liked it a lot before this ""upgrade"". I would pay for the features I liked: distance goal set, steps amd map tracked, workout paused when stopping, statistics at end of walk were good. But NOT at the cost of my phone calls. Sorry."
"Please what happened to the coaching function, it helps is my running progress and now I cant find the option there after 100mb update... please help with this"
"Very disappointed with the last few updates on this app, alot of the old features have been removed and i no longer get alerts to record my sleep or for workouts etc. Why get rid of the features that people actually make use of.. quite pointless even having this on my phone now! Not as user friendly as before, would not recommend it."
"It was great until the last update. I sync between my fitness pal and Samsung Health and now food will not transfer to Samsung Health. I've uninstalled and reinstalled many times and it doesn't work. Also, the step notification cannot be removed. I hope you fix these issues."
"A great app ruined. I was very overweight and used S.Health as a driving force to get back into shape. The weight management has changed, which overall was the strong point of this application. The update has removed some features that were extremely relied upon, and now all S.Health has done is made itself obsolete in comparison to the other health apps there are. Not only that, Google Fit along with most other big names seem to have full support for accessories where S.Health lacks."
"This app was great until the latest update new layout is dreadful and requires constant scrolling to locate specific workouts, time consuming and tedious. Clown who thought up the new layout shoukd be fired, return to the previous layout please Samsung it was much more user friendly and didn't need changing. Having now tried to use the app it is absolute rubbish you can no longer log your workouts for various activities and all my previous data has been erased thanks for nothing Samsing. Rubbish app now do not install.hate this so much and the loss of my data that will be deleting my app and changing to an I phone or other Android device"
I have to agree with the reviews so far. The update removed the most important feature. Weight management. It's the reason why I use Samsung Health to begin with. The fact that it is no longer available is disappointing. I lost 76 lbs using the app. Now I struggle to see how many calories I was over or under per day. Making it very difficult to keep track of weight loss. Shame. Shame.
it is a really good app that tracks my walking and excersise. the only flaw is when i go to add in my food when i search if up its not always there. Would be better with a barcode scanner or a more wide range of products so you can choose the correct item to be more accurate.
I track my BP using this app... in new version all the data and summaries that used to be in front of eyes are just gone. Luckily data export function is still there which is handy. I couldn't understand how Samsung can release an updated app with so many less features than the one it replaces.
"Worked with Samsung 8+ phone will not work with Samsung 22+ I finally figured out what went wrong. The Samsung Health app now works on my new Samsung 22+. I have always loved the app, but could not get it going on the new phone - UNTIL I turned off the Bluetooth on my old phone and uninstalled the app on the Samsung 8+ phone. The instructions on line and through Verizon, never said a word about that. I guess everyone thought it was common knowledge. The Health app is now linked to the Samsung 22+ and working fine. I raised my star rating to 5 stars. Thanks for your time and concern on this matter."
"I've been using Samsung Health for past many years and it has considerably improved adding features all along the way. Just one thing I would love to see added is a ""Virtual id"" of the user like the name and age and any existing medical condition and emergency contact, in the attached wearable (like my Gear 2 watch) because I do not usually carry my phone when I go on Runs or Walks and in case of an emergency, good Samaritans can just check the data do the needful. Thanks, ""The Chanting Runner""."
"Half of the data isn't correct or won't work. Once I start a workout on my watch, it stops after five seconds. my sleep records never load or sync. I can't reply to text messages, and I can use Samsung pay. I have an expensive watch that tells time, Not a smart watch."
"And still no help...I have written a review before and I received a ""drone response"" from the developer of this app. I have restarted the updated version of this app and it still does not...all I get is an error message that says ""time has expired"" even after signing in three times. This is the worst update I have ever had. Fix it on your end because I can't fix it on mine. (Pastor Curtis Webb)"
"Generally not a bad app, even though options for analytics are really not very sufficient, but I could live with that. What I hate is that I cannot select only my watch for step count. While using the app to record biking, the app still counts steps from my S9+ and just adds them up, instead of realizing that I'm on a bike and not walking. As a consequence my steps are really off the charts."
"First I was hesitant 2use, eventually came around. It was ok.Then they updated it, I liked it esp the nutritional info&breakdown of the foods.Speaking of food sometimes it can be challenging to specifically get the right item.At times I make my food then sometimes it doesn't list the exact market item. 1thing I don't like is it limits the exercise u can input in ur daily routine, only 3-it should be unlimited.I updated 2day, I don't like the look/format.Gonna find better.My 1mistake is updating."
"Useful but buggy. I tried to put a Samsung Health widget on my home page and it doesn't work. The app itself doesn't work properly; refuses to sync and doesn't let me add info. Not sure if this is because of the latest android update? Before that, the app was perfectly fine."
"Ever since it is updated on 4th March 2021, there are many snags. 1. It is not uodating the workouts from Samsung Gear Fit 2 pro 2. It's not syncing with Strava. Tried many times, it shows connected With Strava but still nothing getting synced with Strava. Pathetic experience. No help in getting the issue detected."
"New phone bought...cannot even open the health app. I keep getting pop up message that I need to go to settings and allow permissions. I have checked and given permissions but still cannot open. Cleared cache. No luck. Uninstalled app, got a little further but see that permission needed was for me to allow samsung health to manage phone calls! Um, NO! I loved this app with previous phones. Very frustrating. Will uninstall for good."
I've been using this for years. On my third Samsung phone. But it stopped tracking steps most of the time. It has been inconsistent but now I can walk thousands of steps and it won't register in app. It also does not sync up with my fitness tracker. That would solve the problem also. There's not much reason for me to use it anymore. I used to use it tons.
"I'm very disappointed with the new update. I loved this app so much because of the weight management, that has been cancelled. I also wasn't happy when the weight management was removed from the main place in a previous update. This app is degraded step by step and at this point it is usless. I was thinking about buying devices like scale and wrist band compatible with this app and I'm very happy now that I didn't do it yet."
"The App has been revised. It is now difficult to read the data and details off the App. The map is not so good, with small line of travel, the graph is difficult to read, layout generally unhelpful. How can I reload the old version?"
"New update requires permission to manage phone calls and claims it is needed to connect with friends and send them challenges. Well, I just wanted to see my BPM graph, but that is no longer possible. I will recommend not using Samsung smartwatches anymore. Samsung has the best hardware for smartwatches, but to get access to your own health data the app now needs almost unlimited access to everything on your phone. Choose another company to for your next smartwatch."
"I'm a former fitbit user there are a couple of things that I miss (1) being able to scan Bar codes of food packages and change portion size to calculate nutrition and have it go eight into the app (2) Being able to input exact ounces is ounces of water not just haircuts. And I have to watch 4 so maybe so maybe in the in portion a little more explanation as to what is BMI, skeleton muscle and the like"
"I loved this app, but it got much much worse. GPS tracking doesn't work well, it doesn't follow my walking track, it only shows the shortest distance on the map from point A to point B. Moreover, it doesn't count the kilometers and burnt calories properly during the trainings (mainly hiking and backpacking)...it pisses me off."
"It's good for tracking footsteps in a day but I'm bummed that they took away some features, or at the very least they don't work. Like the heartbeat measure. Other than that it's a good app, well put together and has a good looking UI."
"I like the app a lot better when all of the features worked. The positives are the free videos that give you ideas on exercises to incorporate into your routine. Other than that the walking challenge is fun, and for me I like the stars."
"Good but most food measurements are in grams so I have to convert to ounces on Google. Their food library is nowhere near as expensive as My fitness pal. The sync between the apps was so bad I just started using this one. When I was using that other app this one wouldn't count all my exercise. On this one if you don't start your type of exercise before you get going it won't differentiate between running, jogging and walking very well. US measurements please!"
"I have been using this app for a while and loved that it syncs with my smart watch but with the error that my phone is rooted I cant access the app and track my progress. I have read the other reviews, tried to clear cache, and no I will not call for customer service. Just fix the app soon or I'll find another one."
This used to work well until the upgrade. Now my Active2 records half the calories for the 'other workout' than it did before for exactly the same cardio class with the same average heart rate. Tried to swap to the Aerobic workout but this no longer appears on my watch as an option. I think this update was clearly intended for Active3 and 4 users as Active2 users seem to be having lots of problems
"Samsung Health updated it's Privacy Policy on April 5, 2021. Now in order to use the app you have to allow access to your camera, contacts, phone and storage. If you do not comply, you are locked out of the app and cannot get all your workout data. Samsung Health says they need access to these things to better optimize user experience. That is B.S. Samsung having access to my camera, contacts, phone and storage isn't helping me, it is helping Samsung. üò°"
"Used this for years but latest update has rendered it unusable. Yesterday I couldn't view my activity as app just presented a spinning loading disc when I tried to view, now today it asks for phone permissions (which I granted) and proceeded to tell me my Samsung account session has expired and I need to sign in again (fine, happy to do so) but when I hit continue to log in the app closes so I can't sign in. I fear I've lost six years or so of health data. It really made me feel sad today."
"11/01/21 Update: Now the steps widget is even worse: it's opaque now instead of transparent and the word ""steps"" has been added. Minus another star. Previous review: The once clean step counter widget now includes unnecessary text and is now only available as a 4x1 tile. The app now also requires access to the phone and packs much more unwanted bloatware than before. It's still a good app, but it's becoming less user friendly as Samsung attempts to maximize its profit-making potential."
"Really nice app. How to keep my business & become a 5-star?? REQUEST/RECOMMENDATION: Better graphing & summary of historical data or a website for such. I want to stick with a Galaxy watch, but FitBit will graph data over time while S Health will only let you ""Trend"" with a few data points visible & then scrolling. I especially like seeing graphs of the Sleep *Stages*. FitBit will let you see that with 1wk or 1mo on the screen at a time & includes averages in each stage. I *LOVE* the galaxy watches (was hoping to upgrade) & the data it collects; unfortunately, the reporting is inferior & I'll be switching to FitBit. :'( If this could be a coming-soon feature, please let me know asap."
I love this app! I literally cannot do with it during workouts when combined with my galaxy fit watch. However having an issue were my steps are not accurately synced to y app from my phone. I have restarted both phone and watch. Cleared cache on samsung WEARABLE and health. All new updates installed....still have this issue.....pls pls assist
"Very much upset by the functioning of this app. It was much impressive though but now it irritates me. I had recently bought a new fitness tracker viz Riversong MOTIVE smartwatch and when I tried to search it on this app for its compatibility, it denied the presence of any such watch via Bluetooth or location though watch was connected with my phone via BT. Kindly give support for other brands watches also."
One star for the simple fact that you can't change the default water intake amount. How stupid. Fix this already Samsung. Don't be so daft.
"I have used this app for years with no problems until recently. The app now wants permission for your contacts, every file and the ability to use your phone and change app permission. I cannot get into the app at all today. I have uninstalled it and re installled but still won't let me in. I will uninstall the app and find another."
"I can't believe all of the negative reviews! I have never once had a problem with this app. It tracks all of my activity, heart rate and sleep without me having to do anything extra to get it to track me using a Samsung Gear Fit 2. I started using it over 2 years ago after I had kidney surgery for cancer. By tracking all of my activity and my food intake, I was able to lose 65 pounds! I have continued to use the app and am still keeping the weight off. This app is awesome! Thanks Samsung!"
"I've been using this app to count my steps and record my activity. As of a couple of days ago, I noticed that it's not consistently recording my steps - and it's gotten MUCH worse. I've cleared the cache, I've paused recording steps and turned it back on, I've ensured I have the most correct version. I don't know what else to do!"
"the latest update makes the screen on galaxy watch turn off during workout and it no longer vibrates to let you know when a rep is finished. this was really convenient and helped me work out much much more often than I did before owning the galaxy watch active, but now it feels useless! I can't see my reps anymore I have to move my wrist, it no longer vibrates on begin or rest, and those were really good features!"
Eventually got used to the time-lapsed view of weight loss and since the last update its having issues again. If i go to the initial view of my current weight its correct but if i go to the time lapsed chart view it shows ranges in the 100s (which i am not). Please fix this issue!
"Watch4 and blood oxygen tracking is terrible. I'm not sure on accuracy, but no ability to see a graph... Also, it records my SpO2 during sleep. My watch reports my low for the night, but going into the phone app, it says there is no data... Why? Update: Last I've check, I didn't get any SpO2 data at all... The watches reliability of measuring it has dropped also, telling me that I need to keep still even though I'm not moving."
Horrible bug in bed mode wake up clock
"I've used Samsung Health for many years, and jumped through hoops to try and connect step count to my companies health program with intermittent success using a connector app. Well, recently I moved to a Garmin watch, and cannot send steps to Samsung Health. While I can send most other data, the app is useless because of this unnecessary restriction."
"It would be nice if sleep data contained the hr/min spent in each sleep stages. Also, the water tracker has only one option to track daily intake...8.4 fl oz. It would be nice if there were more options. But, if you're someone who drinks 8.4 fl oz every time you drink water then this will work. And the ad banner at the top is annoying."
"I used to give this app 4.5 stars. However, I just went into the app to log my food to find it has completely changed and no longer gives me the macros, only the calories. Seriously! Who only looks at the calories!?! I want the macros back and not just a lame bar giving me Samsung's recommendations and where I fall. It doesn't even advise how much protein Samsung advises, only a bar without any indication as to what the bar really means. Please include the macros back in the food."
"I love this app and have used it for years but there are some things the annoy me. Specifically the sleep log. I have a galaxy watch and it often ""logs"" sleep during times that I'm simply sitting quietly meditating or watching TV which messes with my sleep score. Having insomnia it's important for me to track things but not being able to edit the sleep log has made this impossible. PLEASE FIX!"
"Please add kickbiking / scootering and skateboarding to the exercise list! Other than that, it's a great app, very easy to use, very easy to keep track of your workouts and physical activity. Also, no ads. Please add the two sports I've mentioned in the list!"
"This app used to work great. Don't know what happened but within the last week or two, the stress no longer works. It will give count and do your O2 and pulse but won't do the circle and register stress. Most troublesome is that the blood glucose keeps changing formats and I can only log a few per day in my format. I go to settings and units of measurement and it is blank, so can't change it. Please go back to last update. This doesn't work. Looking at alternatives."
"The new Home Screen design is extremely inefficient & time consuming. If the user is attempting to start a new workout or review previous workout data, the applicatiom no longer allows the user to quickly select the preset workout types or view your recent works filtered by workout type. In terms of user functionality, this is the worst Samsung Health update to date. Prior to the update I used this app several times a day, after the recent update I rarely use the app."
I absolutely would have given this app a five stars 6mo ago. I switched my phone & the app no longer works. I was kind waiting for an update that made it work. Still had a Galaxy and Samsung The app itself it doesn't record anything except steps. It doesn't read for heart rate blood O¬≤ and stress. It did. Now it doesn't do what it was designed for. I've even upgraded my phone to a 21+ in Jan. Still waiting for an upgrade to make it work.
"It's a good app in general, but it stopped counting steps in real time and now need closing and opening every time to update steps number? It is not a big deal, but it's kinda annoying! Update: First of all thanks for your help last time, everything was working perfectly till today! I've been walking for at least 5 kilometres today, and the step count says 0 steps!!!"
"Mileage is inaccurate most of the time. Outside it corresponds with my wife's iPhone about 40%. When I walk on an indoor track, one lap is 1/10 of a mile, It is always inaccurate. On one occasion my watch told me I had walked 3 miles in 10 laps. Crazy! My wife's iPhone counts each lap exactly. Every time! 10 laps equals 1 mile."
New update is garbage. Requires 2-step verification but doesn't let you submit the code to finish setting it up! Plus is 2-step really necessary? I don't think hackers give a damn about my steps or weight. Now to find a better app. Of course this one stops working mid steps challenge at work. Grrr.
"Loved using this app in the past but since the ladt update there seems to be a major bug. I'm using the app on a Huawei phone, and the moment I open the app and it starts loading the app completely crashes. I can't access any features of the app. This is frustrating because I use a samsung gear fitness watch but can't access any of my data through the app anymore..."
"Why ads in the app? I just got a very strange reply from the developer saying that there is no ads in this app. I am more that confident that top half of screen the screen is covered with a banner offering me to buy S21 (that I am using right now, and I am surprised that the app doesn't know that) and Samsung wireless earphones. Further communication with Samsung confirmed that Samsung believes that Samsung ad ""is not an intrusive as as you may find in other apps"". This is simply hilarious ü§£"
"My previous review below has been deleted! The problem is NOT a fault. No average steps on watch? GETS WORSE WITH EVERY UPDATE! The Galaxy watch used to show on the watch face how many steps had be completed for the week and how many steps either greater/ less than the previous week. Now only shows whether your GOAL was met. Can get the info by going to the phone but this has also been updated. Not good, bring back showing the steps progress ON THE WATCH as it was before the update. Not happy"
"I have been using this app for years to track my exercise and was very satisfied, however in recent months I have been very disappointed. The app has been steadily ""deteriorating"" with each update. The voice on the app is slurred also does not take pulse,stress or pulse ox as previous. Very disappointed!"
"I like how it tracks my steps and detects walking workouts. However, it hasn't updated the 'achievements' in along time, I'd like to know if I am getting faster etc. I think it also use to note the incline, which I don't think it does anymore."
"Hello, the app doesn't seem to be able to track my steps recently. Is there a bug somewhere that you can fix asap?"
"I've always enjoyed the app but with the new update requiring a two step verification and permission to manage phone calls now it won't log in, keeps making me repeat the log in and two step verification over and over. Not a great update. Take it back to the drawing board and stop trying to fix what's not broken. After my comment was posted I got a reply saying it should work eventually. Let me be clear. No one wants the two step verification. No one wants to share their phone # or manage calls"
"I've been using Samsung mobile phones for the past 10 years and their watch for the past 3 years. I love their products. However, I'm outraged their newest update of Samsung Health is requiring permissions to my phone calls and contacts. I'm hoping Samsung will remove that permission requirement. If not, I will look for alternative health apps that work with my Samsung watch. If none exist I will sell my watch and Z-flip and purchase a phone and compatible watch. I am beyond disappointed."
Would have gotten all the stars but I'm giving one less due to them taking out the sp02 part of the app. I like having it. It was just as accurate as the monitor bought from the medical company. Its easier to take the phone and not have to pack around the monitor. I wont upgrade my phone due to they took this little device out of the newer models.
"What's going on with it. It keeps ""updating"", but nothing is happening. It's FROZEN!!! Please fix. I also lost week 43 through these errors. Update: 4/24/2021: now the sleep chart changed into one cycle. Update 8/1/2021: after another software update one more very useful information piece was taken away. And the BMI thingy isn't working either!"
"This August 2020 upgrade seems to have removed functionality. You can only manually add data for limited exercise types. For example you cannot manually add data in the app for 'other workout'. Not sure why that functionality has been removed. Further, it would be great to have an option to add CrossFit as another exercise type."
Was doing fine but 10/13 update seems to be draining the battery again. Will be denying physical activity again.
I would have given 4 stars because the app was good the previous features and environment of weight management was so good that I lost 6 kgs with it and one update ruined everything. You removed that feature. Now I wish I had bought a garmin watch and not active 2. Also data sync with strava has been an issue since the existence of Samsung health. When are you going to fix that?
"The new sign in flow is terrible. There's no way to skip setting up 2FA (need to first accept it and then press ""Not now"" which gives you error and sends back to sign in screen). After setting up 2FA (which I feel being force to do), the success state of the app redirects me where? To a set up of 2FA again üòÜ then after trying again I'm getting another weird error. Well done, Samsung. Hope your team will fix that broken sign in flow ASAP. Without it my watch is useless."
I had app disabled for awhile due to not using it. Then reactivate app and got this page were I have to use continue button. Keep getting a (check your network connection and try again 0x2700001). I checked for update and updated app. Same problem. I uninstalled app and re-installed app many times from play store and galaxy store. Have same problem. I did research and added all the permissions listed multiple times. Still no luck. Whats going on? Would like to use again. Thanks
"No longer syncing properly with My Fitness Pal. Sends multiple copies (in the hundreds) of the same records. Had to disconnect it when it added 30,000 calories of cycling to MFP. Effectively renders my Galaxy Watch and entire fitness monitoring system completely useless. Will now look for more reliable alternatives."
"*Update Feb 2020* did one of the recommended workouts in the program; very poor pre stretching warm ups and cool downs, robotic voice and too fast paced, risk injury or avoid! Being able to rate and feedback on each one would be helpful to others Preferred it before the last update, all my stored weight info disappeared and id like to be able to manually add in the bmi, the scales say different to the app and i cant change it. Came here to look for a better app"
"Initally gave it a rating of 4. Lately I have noticed the app doesn't log the steps automatically. I need to open the app everytime I head out on a walk. Earlier it would log the distance, time etc without me having to open the app. At times inspite of opening it ..it doesnt log the activity. I am not sure what has happened if it was a recent update etc. I walked about 10k couple of days back and it didnt reflect on the app. Infact it was just refreshing. So disappointed with this."
Tried using this app for the first time in a while. It immediately asked me to update or I couldn't use it. Fine. After the update I had to sign in. Of course I had to reset my password which took about three or four times. Then I had to verify it which also took about 2 or 3 times. Then I HAD to set up the to factor authorization in order to use the app. And of course that didn't work AT ALL. The goal is for your users to actually use your app.
"Love this app, really helps me with tracking my calories. Though sometimes it doesn't have all the food but that is okay. It also helps with tracking my weight, water intake, exercises and more! üòä it definitely helped with my fitness goals and it's very easy to use!"
"The step count and the distance calculation is a total mess in this app. On days with bad weather when one would like to walk or run indoors, the distance calculation doesn't work. Also the food items in the app has been deleted and it's impossible to have your food intake updated."
They ruined the app with the last update... total lack efficient use of space. Took away third party app I tergration (example myfitnesspal). Everything you hate about an app they did to this update.... please go back to square tiles .... way better use us spaces than the sections with rounded corners and a lot of empty space between sections. Please go back to the previous version. The only reason why I am not uninstalling the app is because I have the watch... if they did this before I got my watch... I would not have gotten the Samsung watch... I really I joyed the integration between myfitnesspal and the Samsung health... the Samsung health is pretty much useless now. Go back to the previous design or I might go to competitor.
"Just bought a samsung galaxy 3 watch for the lte feature. Trying to use the health app but can't. The app on the phone wont log in at all which means half the features, specifically the womens health wont open at all. Uninstalled, reinstalled, restarted phone. Nothing seems to work. I was a fitbit user before but they dont have an lte watch or i would have stayed with them to be honest. Disappointed."
"Was okay until updated in April 2021. Now wants permission to phone & contacts and other items that it has no need for - except to collect even more info. Hey Samsung, why don't you answer the question about needing access to contacts and make phone calls. Your assurances it's needed for ""optimal experience"" is NOT an answer and we know it. The updated agreement is so wide you could put a cruise ship through it -sideways. Nope, not happening. You're not being honest. moving on. Bye, Samsung."
"Does not sync with Google fit and recently just stopped syncing with other apps for no apparent reason. Weight management keeps you under constant pressure from 12am onwards telling you are OVER or UNDER until you start naturally burning energy and final balance only becomes clear at midnight!! The global challenge needs improving as the large numbers in rankings stop making sense, needs reconsidering."
"Sleep tracking hasn't been working like it has. Updates hopefully will fix. Would LOVE to have a cast to tv/device for the workouts that are included. Hate watching them on the phone. Also would love to see ""Bixby"" shelved and Google Assistant added. Or the option to pick. The app in the store is useless."
"I want to love this app.....but the horrible battery drain is killing it's potential. It's 9:30 in the evening, I've used the app for a total of 12 minutes all day with no exercise, and it's used 20% of my battery and states it's been used for over 17 hours. This is been an issue with this app for many years and it's sad it hasn't been fixed."
"I was used to check the app daily and record eating habits, water intake, workout routines, etc. I noticed this week the app wouldn't synch with my GearFit2 so I reinstalled everything and now I can't get past que login screen on the samsung app, it keeps me on the ""loadind"" screen forever. I'm very disappointed because I uninstalled a lot of other apps to use just this one and now I can't even open it."
"This WAS a great app for years, until it started requiring me to create a Samsung account to use it. No thanks. Edit: Samsung's reply to this review is unsatisfactory. The real reason for requiring a Samsung account is to rope more people into yet another ecosystem for the purpose of trafficking in personal data, not to ""safely store, transfer and back up your data."" I have no need to store or transmit my health data to ANY entity anywhere, least of all Samsung who has no business with my data, and I have my own ways to back up the data on my phone."
"This used to be a great app. After each upgrade, Samsung wants more permissions to stuff that makes no sense while offering fewer features. Typical response from Samsung, unfortunately. Just DELETE the App and install Under Armor. At least UA is designed to track health. The free version of UA is as good as the older version of Samsung Health. Very disappointing, Samsung."
"The new update is faulty, I cannot log in to even get past the sign in page (loading spinner just circles indefinitely) thus rendering my expensive galaxy smart watch useless for any kind of health data analysis. Samsung UK don't seem to understand this app issue. Do not update the app to this version as it may lock you out completely. Very disappointed"
"When I first got S4 watch I could choose activities, such as stationary bike or badminton, in Samsung Health. Now I can not. What happened?"
"I have use this app since the beginning of my running, I did love this app coz it's embedded with my phone, the simplicity of menu and the distance accuracy. However, right now, it's so disappointing for distance accuracy and the auto movement detection are failed to satisfy my running activity."
I bought the latest watch it doesn't sync anymore and you have removed weight management features. Also add back the calories below and above target. Currently it's pointless. Since you aren't bringing back the weight management feature. I've decided to leave the Samsung eco system.
"I like the app primarily for the sleep quality information, but that portion of the sleep tracker disappears periodically with no apparent way to bring it back. And there is, apparently, no ""help"" available, either on the app itself or online. I really expect better of Samsung."
"App doesn't count steps anymore until after I open it each day. The step counting functionality is useless unless it counts steps automatically as soon as I pick up my phone in the morning, which it *used to do*. It appears a recent app update has created this issue, but until it gets rectified, the step counting functionality of this app (which is basically the only reason I use it) is useless."
"I loved this app and decided to update, big mistake now I can even log in, the 2 step verification doesn't even work, once you receive the code by text it doesn't allow you to continue. Very disappointed. The problem here is that the Verify button doesn't work so you can't complete the verification üò°üò†"
"There needs to be a way to edit the sleep times. For example, I wake up 1-2 times per night to feed my twins. Since I am relatively still during this time, the watch/app counts it as sleep and I can't remove the record. Very frustrating and makes the data inaccurate."
I love the Samsung Health app Wiith that being said I do not like the fact that it does not have a barcode scanner. Some of the caloric values are not accurate and I find it frustrating. I am looking into other options that I think may suit me needs better. Hopefully this app will get a scanner.
"Since the latest update (March 2022), I am not able to open the app. I use it to know how much step I make per day and the other services available included within. But lo and behold, not anymore. Update: I followed the steps provided below and still, the app says updating or when I try to open it, it only shows loading status. So no, reviews stays at 1."
"Hate newest version of a Health Every time I look at my phone I see the login screen for the app. You can't log in because when the app dents the text with the second verification the login screen is gone. So your stuck in a never ending loop. Hate, hate, hate this new version. Maybe it's time to buy a Fitbit or some other new watch."
"Before, I have used Fitbit and tried Apple Health. I find myself preferring this though when it comes to day-to-day life. Food logging isnt as stressful as Fitbit's, and still offers many features I'm looking for (most types of exercise tracking, steps, heart rate, water). What I would like changed: more trackable exercises like HIIT or kickboxing (while I dont use Google Fit, I love the variety it has) and a better global challenge system (I want to see who's actually in the lead, not bots)."
"Cannot get in contact. How am I going to call you in Korea from the UK??? Who is paying my phone bill? Standard response obviously. Poor customer service. There is not a MORE function to tap within the app. There is no PAUSE COUNTING. Is the UK app different? Loved this app, however now have two issues. The app is no longer syncing with My Fitness Pal. This means my steps are no longer registering to help with calorie counts. Having to input manually, which is just a bit of a pain to be honest."
"I can't seem to track my cycle rides. I start the workout and it only tracks the time elapsed. And yes, before I press start the location is on and it pinpoints me precisely on the map. However, after the ride, it can only tell me how long I was and nothing else. It worked the week before but now it doesn't. I gave it access to everything, even tried uninstalling and reinstalling."
"Had the app 3 months and it started.. .....okay-ish. Twice a week it would reliably NOT read my steps and workout, and for the past week it has not read my steps and workout once. I've uninstalled and reinstalled, bu5lt I'm getting annoyed a great deal. I will give it a week and see if I sorts it out, if not I will remove it."
"Too bad I can't send pictures in a review. I'd show you just what this app has done for me over the last 9 months. For me the steps, distance, calories burned have really made my routine a success! I use it on my phone only without a smartwatch. It's been great."
The most recent update of the app means that there is no way of finding out how many calories you burn in a day. It only shows active calories. It has become entirely obsolete as a tracker in terms of calorie consumption as you have no idea what your total expenditure is any more! No idea what Samsung were thinking!
"I absolutely love this app and I have been using this app for close to 3 or so years It is probably one of my 5 top favorite health apps!!! My favorite things about this app is being able to check my pulse, tracking how Many steps I take through the pedometer and being able to compete with other people worldwide! It is also great to be able to track your weight and keep track of what you eat and how many calories you consume."
I would like to use the App but can not login on my new Oppo Find X2 Lite phone. It just hangs when I click the signin button. It does work on my old phone thou. Try what the Developer has suggested but it still had the problem. I look online for an answer and found that others that had downloaded the last old App version which does let you login. Then you can update to the new version.
Very very bad app never download worst app ever not worth giving 1 also.
I appreciate how seamlessly it operates with Samsung products such as The Samsung watch. My only gripe about it is the food log is not nearly as sophisticated as others I have used in the past. It doesn't give you the option to scan barcodes nor does it have a vast database like other apps have so you have to put food nutrition in yourself more often than not
Was a 5 star app now a 2 star. This WAS a fantastic app and helped me lose a lot of weight earlier this year but only through the weight management widget. It's now useless after the recent update as I can't track my progress through the day and make decisions about what to eat. Please bring it back otherwise I'll have to find something else.
"This app was very convenient, easy to use etc. However they recently changed it so that in order to use it, you have to accept a new permission. They want to have access to/make phone calls. Nah one step too far Samsung, uninstalling app immediately. Such a shame as it was really useful."
I've been using this app daily for a long time and today all of a sudden it won't open giving an error message about my phone being rooted which it is not. I had to Google that to see what it even meant! Apparently this is a known issue that happens randomly. I did an update and now it says unauthorized changes were made and the app cannot open. As a galaxy watch wearer I'm very frustrated!
"recently lost the ability to add foods not in the database... This used to be usedul to add your own meals ans foods that were not in the database. There have been several nice updates that make it easier to use.and configue/customize, but losing the ability to add foods is a major loss. Hoping to see it restored in another update."
"I use to check my heart rate when I feel anxious, noticed it has a breathing exercise portion. Went to use it and it speeds through the 6 cycles in less then 1 second. Not sure why this happens, updated the app to to see if it fixes, but it didn't."
I had to get a new phone after almost 6 years. I got a S20 FE 5G and my old samsung health info did not transfer so I had to download the new Samsung health app and about half the features are gone. I think they did that so I would have to buy one of their watches. New upgrades are not always a good thing. What my old phone had on it was just fine and even better in some cases. I do not like this new version. Wish I had my old samsung health info back.
No womens health tracker! I can't understand why you would take away such an option?? Surely this should be a priority to keep in your app
"Essentially a bunch of false promises. A lot of missed opportunities (e.g. poor integration with the Galaxy watch, imprecise sensors) causing users to manually enter data only to get laughable statistics and useless context-specific motivation. Data download always errors out. Did I mention that it's obtrusive?!"
I like it. Coming off Fitbit this is more informative and just as easy to use. I like the sleep tracking and the breakdown of all the sleep cycles ( something you need to pay for with Fitbit premium) you can even count your steps without a watch by hair using your phone. Super convenient for charging a watch. The food tracking is great and exercise tracking is wonderful. So many options! It's a little overwhelming at first but once you're used to it it's awesome.
"Stops counting steps. constantly. I used to love this app but the fact I have to reset it and hope it works every couple days is getting old very quick, then it ruins my data for only counting about ten steps for the entire day. What is going on? Why does it keep stopping?"
1 star! Please get rid of all the cheaters in the monthly challenges! It is very unmotivating to play
Samsung health lags far behind Garmin's apps. The accuracy of the electronics/tracking/heart rate all seem better on Garmin. Seems like Samsung put out a watch just to gather more data but they don't really care about how useful it is. I really wish you could trim or crop a workout when you forget to manually end it.
"Does things pretty well but comes up short in 2 areas for me. 1. One can track their weight and set an overall calorie budget, but not seeing them integrated with exercise to form a weight loss plan. 2. I have a desk cycle that I want to manually record my time, distance, and calories burned. Calories burned auto calculates for all exercises so have to either minimize the time of the exercise or the distance to get the calories burned to be somewhat close. Would like to manually adjust calories."
Mediocre. It's very difficult to get ahold of someone either by call or email. My daily calories show my inline skating but not my walks. Additionally the calorie counter for inline skating is about 1/3 of what it should be. Less than walking for goodness sake. I have called for 2 to 3 years about every 6 months. I was assured it would be fixed but turned out to just be lies probably to get me off the phone. Horrible. The sad thing is I really liked this app when it used to work. So frustrated.
"The app has been effectively become broken. I cannot login into the system. Tried changing password - no success, setting 2FA - no success. I cannot see my statistics, I cannot watch my sleep. Why do I need this fancy gadget if it doesn't show me stats on my smartphone? Thanks for selling me digital watches with app that has died after a while. Ps: no, I cannot open ‚Äòsettings' as app wants me to login."
"I like a lot of the things the app can do, however it doesn't tailor to specific diets. I'm on the Keto, but it suggests my carb intake be higher, and it doesn't count the dietary fiber in my food, which is how I get my net carbs for my diet. So when I go to check my carb intake, it always looks way more than my diet allows. It would be awesome if there was some kind of fix to this, because I love that my phone and watch can communicate to each other about my activities."
"I really enjoy the wealth of information and coaching. Almost 5 stars. I would like to see more cumulative metrics, such as total run time, miles, steps, etc. in all of the running programs and another set for total with a slider bar for date range."
"I like this app, but I wish they would do more with the period tracker. I wish there was a widget I could put on my homescreen that counts down to my period. 2/1/22 I ended up going back to the same period tracker I've used since I was 12. Samsung's is useless. If I update it on my watch, it doesn't alert me. If I update it on my phone it doesn't alert me. Too bad too, would have really been nice."
"Updated 15/02/21 tried everything suggested and it is still not working, seems mine isn't the only one so assuming there is an issue with the app. I am not ringing the number as will no doubt be charged a small fortune. Had been great until a week ago and twice now its stopped counting steps. Not helpful when I am trying to count calories and also with the 200000 steps together part"
"Used be the best app, now it's not. First, they removed the weight management section completely, that was the best part. Gone in an update ? Also, for some reason, it's saying I climb 157 floors or 87 floors or some random amount everyday, I live in a ranch style house and rarely use stairs. Been using my Gear Fit watch with this FOR OVER 2 years, every day tracking food and weight , using the weight management features. 2 years of data Gone. Why did they update it? It worked fine"
"Very sad to see the weight management section is gone. I stayed healthy and at the same time lost 10lb over 3 months using this feature, it was very helpful to calculate my calories intake and calories burned through activities. I hope the developers understand people do use these feature and it is indeed helpful and useful. Also I enter caffeine consumption per day this is gone too :( I thought they would add more features for upgrades, not getting rid of existing ones!"
"Sad that despite all the updates, Samsung is still not allowing pool length to be customised by users. This makes tracking swimming workout really tough. Have written to Samsung a year ago and alas no improvement on this, the main reason why i am refusing to buy a Samsung watch. Also weird that workouts on threadmill does not even estimate steps. With the time and distance, pretty sure there will be AI data for estimated steps to be recorded. Please improve on these!!"
"It's good not great!, I don't think it counts accurate steps and I noticed when some people do the monthly challenges they cheat by trying to win the challenge as soon as they can. And there are still people cheating when doing the challenges too. üò†üëéüëé The Developer to this app still hasn't stopped people from cheating in the step challenges which has shown me that he doesn't care for people's opinions regarding the matter even though see states that he is looking into it.üò°üëéüëéü§¨"
"This new version SUCKS. It arbitrarily pauses my workout mid-hike and if I stop to resume, it'll pause again in a couple minutes. It counts my steps, but can't manage to measure my actual workout - and I can't stop to worry about this stupid app when I have to manage my dog at the same time. Will be using the Google app from now on."
"Samsung keeps telling people who don't want to give the app access to the phone for calls and to contacts it is for an optimal user experience, yada yada yada. HOW? Be specific. Why does it need access to this data? Specifically. Now I have to get rid of this Samsung watch. Update: they did not answer the question. My Samsung Active 2 watch has now completely failed. Because it is 18 months old it is out of warranty. Problem solved. Deleting the app and getting rid of the watch."
"Can't sign into the app on the pixel 6. Can't use the health app on the Watch 4 without it. I am editing my review from one star to two stars as Samsung did help me get into the app, but it shouldn't require jumping through hoops. Not sure if that's a Samsung problem or Pixel problem since I didn't have that issue on my S20+. App itself is good and does the job. Samsung continues to make improvements."
"Wrote a two star review a week ago but don't see it. The gist was that a recent update has rendered the step counter totally unreliable. The team replied quickly with some advice (thanksüòÄ) but this has not helped and my 30 minute (approx 3000 step) morning walk today only registered around half of that.üòî I'll wait till the next app update and, if this fundamental feature isn't fixed, I'll be finding another app that counts steps accurately. Shame, as I'll lose my history but hey ho."
"Did like the app but now steps don't sync with My fitness pal, it was temperamental at the best of times and now it's completely stopped syncing them. I've tried everything I can think of and I'm getting nowhere and I don't seem to be the only one! Really not happy"
"Well, this app used to be good but I agree with the comments others have made, that every update seems to remove a useful feature. Most recently, the Trend chart for weight has been removed. This was useful because it allowed you to see how your average weight varied from week to week, or from month to month. Now, all you can see is your day-to-day weight entries, but this is pretty meaningless on its own."
"Edit 4/17/19: I had to update the timezone info on my Galaxy Watch. the app works fine now. ---------------------- Suddenly started recording incorrect sleep times by one full hour. I wake up at 7am everyday, and now this app is recording my wakeup time as 8am. when I edit the wakeup time back to 7am, it moves my starting sleep time instead! the app is not functioning properly. I reset both Gear S3 and Note 8. I cleared the cache for this app. Still not working properly."
I love this app. I have the smart watch so they sync up and keep track of every workout. I enjoy all of the different health areas I can track and I absolutely adore the challenges! They keep me motivated and moving. A must have if you are a Samsunger!
"Problem still persists despite multiple reinstallations. Steps given by you are useful as given options were not available under settings. ‚ûñ‚ûñ‚ûñ This app is behaving erratically on my Xiomi 11t Pro. At the end (&also during) of the planned WALKING session, I have noticed session getting automatically paused eventually giving false or not at all final results. In parallel, I have been using my Samsung Galaxy A8+ and it's working properly. Pls help as this app on Xiomi 11t Pro is totally unreliable."
"Samsung Health helped me find a way to be accountable for my daily food intake and balancing my nutrition better. It had features I really used a lot like the weight recording, water reminders, caffeine intake and others. Great amount of foods and drinks listed in the nutritional database with functions to add your own. Thank you Samsung. I'm down in weight already. I've stopped eating like a six year old. :)"
"I used to LOVE this app. I still use it all the time but recently I've struggled with syncing it with my watch. It tries, and tries ... and then reports that it can't sync which is super frustrating because the watch counts most of my activity and steps."
"It's a solid app but it needs some major things to make it better. I would like to be able to change macros as I workout 2 hours a day so I need slightly different nutrients. I also wish the notifications had less emphasis on steps. I row and burn nearly 1,500 calories a day but get constant notifications about being active"
"Used this app alongside a hand-me-down Samsung Gear Sport. The calorie budget it gave me was way too low, it didn't count steps or calories burned accurately & would have been detrimental to my health had I actually followed its advice. Luckily I was using MyNetDiary alongside it which was giving me more accurate data, otherwise I would have been starving myself. Would give this 0 stars if possible."
"Loved the previous step tracker widget. For some reason things have to be ""fixed"", and now the widget is too large and not transparent. Definitely don't like the change. It's taking up too much of my screen and putting redundant information that's in the time widget already."
"love this app, so easy to use, its great motivation ‚ô• edit on 09/09/21 this app has stopped counting steps. It's always been behind on my steps because I tested it all the time but now it's showing zero steps when I have been walking around all day. I tried to updating and doing a few other things and nothing has worked so I will probably delete if I don't figure it out soon. Which is a shame because I've had the app for years"
"Used to love the app and use it to monitor steps and other health related items...no longer! I have read other reviews recently and Samsung's response to the concerns about needing access to my contacts and phone calls. NOPE, NOPE, NOPE! You absolutely do NOT need access to that info to make the app run more smoothly or be more operational. It will not happen! I just deleted it and will find something else."
"ever since updating my phone, I cannot use this app. I am getting the message that my phone is rooted when it is not. the app keeps opening up by itself and interrupts whatever I am doing. every other Samsung app is fine except for this one. I can access some parts of the app via Bixby like the steps count but I cant open the app itself."
"Now requires users to allow it to make and manage phone calls because of ""features and UX"". All I want this for is to count my steps and use the oximeter. Not backing down on this issue. You didn't require this before. Don't require it now. Uninstalled. Maybe I'll find a new phone brand when I dump my Galaxy S7, it's overdue."
"Everything was fine until I used the updated version. Had to Uninstall twice and it still just keeps loading. I took the phone to t-mobile because it could be an issue on my end . Unfortunately Everything was fine with my phone, lost all my data and it still is trying to loaded at this very moment."
I have enjoy the together feature of the Samsung Health app; especially Competing with friends and other users in step count. Please add an option to be automatically registered/enrolled for the next monthly step count event. Sometimes I notice days into the month that I hadn't join the monthly event. And despite the app having records of my step count for those days. It just starts counting from the joining date.
"Another update and less features, so you can't now track your caffeine intake, the exercise section doesn't add the calories burned to your total for calorie balance. The only thing I use this app for now is sleep tracking. Still can't import any data from my bike computer or fit file and export is, well useless. I so want to like and us this app but MFP integrates to Garmin Connect with data traveling both ways."
"after the last upgrade it is regestering activities out of the bloom. For exemple, the phone is charging, over night, stuck in the wall... and it is marking, like, 30... 40 min of walk!! ridiculous . And worst... I cannot delete the stupid workout. very frustrating"
"Sudden error saying could not work on rooted phone. New Note9 is NOT rooted. No data or cache deletions or reboots helped even with Samsung+ tech help. Have to stop using after depending on this for years. So disappointed on support for this. Update: Now Samsung Pass is giving the same error. Phone is new, not rooted and I am not having this error with any other nonSamsung apps. Virus and malware checks are negative. I'll be staying away from Samsung apps until they can fix this."
"I'm having problems with sign in to Samsung health app. When I enter my credentials, there is waiting screen and it never loads. If I choose Download Data it stays at 0% and nothing happens and if I choose erase data app crashes. I use Huawei p30 pro, and I have latest version of Samsung health app. I've already tried uninstalling and installing the app, clearing cache, delete data from settings and nothing help"
"The app keeps crashing since an update in the summer. Thought the lastest update would solve but nothing. I already tried to clear the cache and delete data, even uninstall and reinstall without success. Bluetooth is turned off and app still crash. Tried to contact the support but they cannot help."
"This app has the wrong phone number for my account and there is no way to login and reset it because I have no access to the incorrect phone number they are sending verification codes to. The app will not even open without this two step authentication. There is no way to remedy this, which renders the entire app useless. Way to go, Samsung."
"Used to love this app. Now I hate it. Makes me regret purchasing my Samsung watch. Now it wants two step verification and access to phone to even get into the app. Each update takes away features. Loved the weight management portion now taken away a couple updates ago. And with this new update it wants more permissions. That you cannot bypass. Going to have to find something else that syncs with my Samsung Watch. Thanks a lot Samsung, you ruined a good thing."
I have sleep apnea and the latest update has totally screwed up any tracking. Since 1/20 It rarely ever shows any deep sleep and all scores are 40 to 65 now. We have 2 Samsung Note 10's and active 2 watches and they are both doing the same thing. Thank goodness I have another to validate this behavior or I'd be scared something was medically wrong!!! Having to slide the clock down to get to select the days is kinda ridiculous üôÑ. We don't need extra steps to get information- we need LESS.
"I like how there is a way to track your periods without having future period predictions. I've always had a problem with this, but it allows you to turn that off. The problem I have though is that there is a limit on cycle length. I can't put in my actual length which is really annoying. I really wish this feature would be updated."
This app shows wrong steps count. My galaxy fit E watch is showing 10000 steps but after syncing with the app the app shows only 135 steps. This has happened thrice with me. This makes you to lose the challenges that you have taken. Have reported this issue but there was no proper solution to it has been given by them.
"I have used this for several years, but it now won't allow me in and I can't check on my number of steps or anything else. hard to recommend something I can't open. I have uninstalled and reinstalled the app several times and I get this same error message: Samsung account session expired. Sign in to Samsung account again. I have done so on my phone and my laptop. Nothing. Same error message. It won't let me sign in on the app. Even after completing the 2 step verification (multiple times). I complete the 2 step verification and it tells me I need to sign into my account again.."
"Step counter no longer works. It doesn't work on my galaxy note 8 or 10. Very frustrating as I used it to count steps while I work. I've tried reinstalling it, changing the app permissions... nothing has worked. It hasn't worked since the last update."
App worked well in the past bar a few hiccups. Now it won't let you access the app unless you grant permission to make and manage phone calls. Seems very strange for a health fitness app!! You didn't need to allow that permission in the past so why now all of a sudden.
"The app is nice enough but the huge ads at the top are horrible. I bought a watch for hundreds of dollars, seeing ads at the top of a companion app is disappointing. Edit: there are still huge banner ads at the top of this app. Most of them are for other Samsung products but there are some about affiliated products/services."
"This app used to be decent but it will no longer allow me to open it unless I give them permission to access my contacts. There is no reason this app needs to know.my contacts! **Update to your reply since your listed email is a ""no-reply"" address: I will not be using the together feature. If that is really your reason for needing the phone permission, it should only be required if I enable that feature. The truth is this is a blatant data grab that most people will be oblivious to."
"The FitBit app has better food entry. Samsung Health is missing the following features: - Scan UPC barcodes to lookup items - Lacks the array of units that FitBit has to enter food. These two things make entering food much easier on the FitBit. I do like that it has a feature to ""build"" Food Items that are comprised of multiple ingredients. This is a great add. All in all, it's good, but I was hoping for more."
Great 5 star app until unfortunately last update (8/5/20) removed weight management aspect which was a major component for me. I also found tracking coffee was also beneficial. This was also removed!Would avoid updating app if you can. I wish I could switch back to older version. I will now instead have to switch to another fitness app. Would not recommend it anymore.
"Update: Samsung has updated the app to include trending for weight. I still miss the weight management features, but huge improvement. THANK YOU!.This app was fantastic and a helpful tool for all the members of our family.....Then they removed weight management features that made our samsung watches, and phones glorified step counters."
"Stopped working properly, uninstalled, then reinstalled. Now it wants access to my phone calls! It's none of your business who I call! In response to your comment... the together feature? Are you serious? I only used it for the step counter. Have found a BETTER app that isn't as intrusive."
"No oxygen reading though phone came with the sensor. There is no stress tracker in my country. If someone could explain why that is? No public sensor apps either, why? Like buying a car with ac but no on button. Update 11/26/2019 after having reverted to an earlier version of of this app that supported the oxygen sensor and not updating it via Google updates, today my phone via Samsung updates forced the app to update without my permission. I'm done."
"I like this application because it is easy to keep track the activity I do. The only thing I think it needs to be fixed is that in the Together section the steps are over counted by about 20%. I only use my gear S3 to count the steps, and they are counted fine in the main dashboard however in Together it is over counted."
"Steps not working and all history gone immediately after update. also in the notification panel there's a notification that won't clear by swiping. This app now officially sucks that's why I don't like doing updates update 10/10/19- No thanks, I won't be calling you to be on the phone with no results, fix it yourself or uninstalling/ disabling."
"I lost 6 years of data with the newest update. The app updated with NO warning, when I tried opening it today I was prompted to login to my Samsung account. Tried logging in but got an ""account already exists"" error. Cleared the cache, restarted the phone and nothing worked. Finally reinstalled the app only to find my profile and six years of data gone. Going to uninstall this and just use my Fitbit app."
"I have been using this app every day for several years. It provides most of the basic functions that I want to use. It would be an even better tool if a few enhancements were made. Two are: 1) allowing us to edit foods that we have created and to delete food from all three lists. 2) calculating NET carbs, not just total carbs. Other apps do this. Sugar alcohol needs to be included as an ingredient field to support the calculation. Adding these features would make it a 5-star app for me."
I have been using most of programs on app but the most important app to me was the walking app and it works good for a while the you can't get it to register for most of the Steps you take and that effects your Calorie intake and many other programs on the watch . There should be an easy clear way to set up your steeps . I can't use this program no longer to lose weight because it is so Inaccurate .
"Needs improvement- first off, needs a barcode scanner like most competitors do, for those that are tracking their daily calorie intake. It also needs to let users connect their fitbits, Oura rings etc. - not allowing other trackers to sync with this app is a major turn-off for me. I am not selling my fitbit or my Oura ring to buy a Samsung-made tracker so it connects to the app."
"Was amazing until an update. Literally over night I can NO longer access the health app because I can't get past the 2 step verification. I've been on live chat and and even created a new account and STILL can't get in. Now I can't access samsung account anywhere because of too many verification code being sent. Being sent to a number that isn't correct and I can't change it, so I'm basically locked out of my account. I've got a samsung fitness watch which now I can't even use. I'm so sad."
"I have been using this app for the last 12+ months, and have been successful with my weight loss journey. Very disappointed to see the removal of the weight management feature. Will most likely start searching for a new fitness app."
This app has become way to invasive with the requirement of almost all of your personal data that has absolutely no bering on the functionality of the app itself. The fact it needs access to your contacts and phone has no relevance to a health app. This was a great app and I had used it for years until this last change requiring the phone and contacts. There is no need for these functions and should be voluntary choices not a requirement of the app this is going way to far. Shame on you SAMSUNG
Unfortunately since the last update the battery of my watch doesn't even last a full day before it needs re- charging. Please fix it and I will change my rating! Also the auto detection of work-outs doesn't work anymore since quite some time and the instructions from your helpline were completely useless.
"I've been using the app since I have started using a Galaxy 2 years ago and it has delivered. Sadly though, auto-fill meals has seemingly stopped working. I hope they bring it back because it helps me keep track of my average calories during my busy days."
"No way to scan food items and not a large data base. I also can't set my ideal or target macros, not customizable enough on food tracking. Otherwise I like the various ways to track sleep and other important factors. And integrates with active 2 watch."
"Monthly challenges are dumb. Based on who finished the challenge vs ppl that entered the challenge. Why enter the challenge when ranking is based on finishers and non finishers are not used? Base the challenges on how many steps I did vs the others. Dumb stats! Other trackers are good, not great. Caloric intake is off but just ok for tracking."
"Since the 1/12/21 update, I can't sign in to the app. When I hit the link to sign in I get an error message, ""Samsung account already exists in account manager"". I tried deleting and readding the account ... with no luck. I tried clearing my cache, force stopping the app, and restarting ... no luck. Please let me know if there is a fix for this."
"Since the last update, the O2 saturation measurement (which has been dumped into the stress measurement) no longer functions. Every time I try it, the app crashes completely. But, I guess it shouldn't surprise me from a company who refuses to provide system updates past two years on flagship phones ($700-1200). Get it together Samsung, as you've turned a huge fan into someone who will never buy another phone from you."
"Latest update removes important tracking ability. Like being able to use any time period you want for tracking progress, like weight and blood pressure. The old version was better in that regard."
"In line with all recent reviews, I find the removal of functionality frustrating. There is no point in rolling out app updates when they remove functionality. Please bring back calorie overview and old view for daily, weekly and monthly calorie burnt etc. Currently, there is no point in opening the app."
Why force 2 step verification? Why change what was perfectly working? I open the app to check my heart rate after feeling a sudden spike and I'm stuck on the authentication page. I'm not interested in advanced features or challenges from friends! All I'm interested in are the monitors.
Great for Samsung ecosystem... I've used the Gear Sport with my S8 and am very fond of this app. It's got a monthly challenge and does a nice job tracking runs. Excellent for the beginner or intermediate exercise enthusiast. It helped me go from 4 miles to 13 fairly easily and ew well with pace. Overall I love it!
"The app was excellent but since I'm using Samsung galaxy watch along to keep a track of workouts and the calorie intake Vs consumed, the weight management widget is removed. What's the point of using the accessories and counting calories when the app doesn't show it. Please fix this. Add the weight management widget like it was in previous version"
"Have been using this app for years and have enjoyed it with my Galaxy watch 4 classic. However, I am now unable to update the app and it says it may not be optimized for my device, a Galaxy Z Fold 3. How is one of Samsung's most popular apps not optimized for one of it's flagship phones? The app no longer syncs my rides to Strava. I have the Strava app on my watch and could delete the Samsung Health app entirely, but I like that it used to announce my time and distance every mile."
"First of all, I really enjoy this app. It's the first one that I've finally got the hang of and use daily. Unfortunately today, August 5th, 2020, an update was rolled out, perhaps it was a bug and an accidental degrade because it feels like it. I no longer have my weight management tab, and my coffee intake tab for some strange reason. The app has become difficult to distinguish colours between my nutrient intake levels and heart beat measurements. I wish it would go back."
Each update removes features. With the latest update the location tracking does't work so cannot calculate distance traveled or map workout route even though the permission is set. Previous updates removed heart beat monitoring from phone sensor - or is it that the latest ¬£1000 phones removed sensor along with the headphone jack and ability to change battery! What next - an update that won't record duration of workout? I'm now looking for an alternative app (and more innovative phone company!)
"Does not count the floors for me on Note 8 under Pie and with location authorized.... I suspect it is no possible to count floors on an android device... They should come clean on this instead advertising it and showing it on the display. Totally impossible to contact them. The email shown above is no-reply! And if you use the website email procedure, they reply with a phone number to call that has been changed recently. Their reply is a no-reply too, so your stuck..."
"The app is okay, but I want to customize it and it won't allow me to. When you open the app it uses steps as the default exercise and you can't change that. I have issues walking but I can ride a bike or an exercise bike. That's how I'm getting my exercise but the app won't allow that to be the default method, so when I look at my stats it says they are down, because the steps are low. I rode a bike for over 2 hours..."
"Loved it until the latest update broke the food integration with My Fitness Pal. Now, no matter what I do, I can't get my food diary to sync with MFP. I've tried every combination of settings and nothing works. Very disappointed."
"I've used this app for many years and track steps, sleep, calories, and water intake, and join the step challenges. But with this update I block access to phone as a matter of principle. It is sad, because I will miss using the app. I would give it 5 star otherwise, and with this update I'm so upset that I want to give it 1 star, but figure I will rate it in the middle."
Stress area doesn't work. It's still stuck on my reading from Feb 7. Stress icon is stuck on Feb 7 at 12:10 AM. Does the app measure stress and O2 levels . If so mine won't work. Need to know if there are solutions and if so how to get it working again. Good app except the O2 and stress level monitoring functions disappeared. In this day and tme more features should be included not less
One of the main features I use the watch is to track my sleep. It stopped working and nobody seems to be able to tell me why. I have tired everything and nothing works. So I get the standard auto reply from Samsung. Of course I tried all the steps they suggested. I really wish we could could give negative stars.
"This used to be a decent app and after the last update is completely useless. Besides the oversimplification, lost data etc. my biggest problem is that it cannot track steps. I can walk more than 90 min and it only records few hundred steps !! Looking for a pedometer ..."
"Previously, the app just allowed access... creating or logging into a ""Samsung account"" was optional. Made the mistake of letting the app update, and now the app requires login before using anything whatsoever. I'm not interested in sync or anything else that shares stuff with others' servers, so there's zero reason I should have to log in. Before that it seemed fine. Uninstalled."
"Very disappointing when you get a new UI that's so pretty and shiny and you take away the most basic of features. Why can I no longer view heart, BP, or any data in day, week, and month. This would allow me to give my Healthcare provider a 2 week average. Please bring back these simple features."
"I used to LOVE this app and it had saved my life when I had an SpO2 of 75% It was accurate. The app no longer is capable of measuring O2 sats. Now it is just a convenient, fancy pedometer with my Samsung watch. Bring back the spo2 capabilities and I will give you 5 stars. Apparently the newer phones (Note 10+) lack the sensor because wearables should suffice. Not in this case!"
There are issues in the sync function and dashboard. Steps are not syncing immediately in the overall mothly summery. It is coming in the weekly summary but not in monthy steps data. I'm able to see the heart rate individually for days but the summary result is empty. Kindly rectify these bugs.
"The invasiveness of the information required to just run this application compared to the amount of usefulness was lacking. I have already removed it. The creating of the account sent my device serial number and registered my phone with them (which I had not wanted/done before. This app required me to give it permissions to be able to make/receive phone calls to launch! there is no need for that. It required much personal information, including my phone number, which I prefer to not give out to launch. My Samsung S8 has a SpO2 sensor (what I was wanting to be able to monitor), but this Samsung app will not work with it, wanting me to get a watch to connect to it. This product demands lots of info, has ads, and gives only basic information, and then wants to send it out of the device. In my case, outside of the country too. Sorry, but not worth it! Likely other products out there that work better without giving up so much. Response to Samsung's reply: ""Provide better overall service experiance"" Knowhing which device that I am using if I have several does NOT help, as I likely don't care which one it comes from. The one it helps is the company knowing how many devices, and which one I am using, when then can be used by them to make money or try to do targeted ads. There is other ways to do it without requiring permissions to do activities that there is no need to have. That it isn't intended to make calls or accessing my call history doesn't mean it doesn't access or upload the information for them to look at."
"Terrible app. Doesn't track how far I run accurately at all. Im running in the middle of Philadelphia so there is no excuse for poor service. I always had the samsung watch to track how far i run but when the battery (whole other issue) went dead i had to resort to this. All you want in a very simple, basic health app is to tell you how far you go or how many calories and this app can't even do that. I've always been team samsung but the fitness is definitely hard to stand behind."
"Invasively inoperable - I use the heart rate monitor on this app, mainly. I now can't do that unless I allow it to make and manage phone calls... It may open up more function or new features, but there's no reason to not allow any function of the app because one doesn't want to allow for a permission that is not necessary for what they use it for. Bottom line, the app has locked out users unless they give up their privacy no matter the reason or intended purpose of the permissions."
"This app asks for permissions that should not be necessary for this capability. Why does Samsung require access to my contacts, location, etc. for the app to even run? These permissions should be optional and it should not prevent usage of features that do not require them. Samsung should not require access to my contacts to allow usage for example. Thank you for responding, Samsung. I see that you believe a health tracking app needs to access my contact list and make/manage phone calls."
"I love this app because I can log calories, water intake, sleep habits etc. The one thing I wish was on this app was that I could log workouts manually. A lot of times I do workouts without my phone and I don't want to use my battery the entire time I'm working out to log the workout through the app. I wish I could manually put in my time and calories burned. I give it 4 stars just for that reason."
"I loved this app. In fact, that and the camera were the reasons I picked this specific phone. I have both heart and lung issues and this app has helped me so much with getting those under control. Not so much now. This update , while probably great to new users, sucks for me. Bring back the oxygen saturation monitoring!!"
"It'd be smart for a working smartwatch providing this feature to bring back continuous heart rate graph. It's scandalous to be forced to downgrade my version because of this ""feature"" which only purpose is to hide the heart rate sensor works terribly on Galaxy Watch 4. I have a Watch Active 2, my sensor works well, I want access to every data it provides and certainly not have them hidden because you failed the Watch 4."
"Disappointed with recent update, loss of functionality for goal tracking and comparing calories burned/consumed. Also all the heart zones in exercise are a shade of orange now where before there was a range of color that was easy to distinguish (blue/green/ylw/orange/red)"
"I would love to see the app interface with more. A lot of third-party apps interface with Apple or FitBit. I would love to see Samsung recognized as an option. Also, it would be nice to have a barcode scanner in the app to track food."
"Great app. I prefer this app over Google fit app, unfortunately it doesn't integrate with mi band or mi band app to extract the workout details from it (heartbeat, distance, speed...). Although it can connect to MapMyWalk which can use mi band but doesn't count the steps recorded on MMW."
I love the simplicity of this app!! You are able to track so many different things. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I wish it synced with other fitness apps. Specifically iFit. Other than that this app is AMAZING. I love the monthly challenges with people from all over the world as well as being able to challenge your friends. Overall great app!
"The App is fantastic, very good, but the LAST UPDATE is horrible. The FOOD section is listing everything what I am not using, and the components are 0 (null), but don't listing the FAT and carbohydrate that the main component of the foods. Somewhere the the text information is very big, and the graphics are very small. But I love this app...."
"Samsung health sucks after new update please give me back my older version, that was so much better. This new version does not record walking activity even if you have turned it on it just pauses the activity on its own and I have to check my phone amidst walking if its recording my activity or has it been paused automatically. I am so pissed at this."
The new update now cause an issue with sync my data (step count) with a third party app. It keeps telling me to select yes to all when there is only on button to select. This update is more trouble than it's worth. I hope Samsung fixes these issues.
Latest update seems to have deleted the only function I found useful - nice one Samsung... Why change the weight average function? Or have you just hidden it somewhere stupid???? And DON'T tell me to ring you - just put the features back or it's uninstall time. Update Feb 2021 - thanks for the response but I have stopped using the app. I can't be bothered using an app that constantly changes and just gets worse and worse. Too late Samsung. Bye!
"The display is nice and features are user friendly. However sad to notice that all other apps such as health 365 are unable to link to the samsung health apps after the upgrade. Even when we uninstall and reinstall, it does not resolve the problem."
"l use to use this app regularly for my runnin sessions with the different type of pre-made programmes where the time and speeds already set up from warmup phase to speed run, with constant audio feedbacks. Now it's gone, l either run for distance, calories or time. A huge step back for the app, gotta find another one."
"I have a suggestion to improve this app. In the ""Fitness Interests"" it would be helpful to have an option to choose what kind of equipment do you have available or if you only want to see programmes without any equipment. It would save some time."
"New update makes it unusable. Thank you for your reply, if I could get into the app, then I could follow that process. I tried emailing you through Play store, it bounced. I do not give permission to make phone calls etc because that is absurd. I just want my steps counted...maybe occasionally to measure my heartrate. That's it. Not hard."
"My health App worked great! Then suddenly I could no longer track or find my pulse ox sats.üò¢ I have COPD and Emphysema so that is important to monitor. Now, my app keeps shutting down when I try to do the stress check because while I never found a way to see the stats and trends, I could still TAKE it under the stress tab. Now, I can't even do that!! üò≠üò≠üò≠ What good are you to me and my health? Can you fix this please?"
"The app is overall good, it works fine to me. Step counting is perfect, auto sleeping data update is almost accurate. Nonetheless I can't give 5 star because of a poor thing. This app automatically doesn't count any satires even their is no data inputs option in manually. I think this thing should be fixed at the earliest."
Cannot even launch the app anymore without giving Samsung my cell# and all my contacts information. Why do I need to give that information to track my HB and work out? This app used to work without giving my phone # AND my contacts list. I do not use the 'together' feature. Update: A short time after leaving this review Samsung notified me that their database has been breached and my personal information may have stolen. My next phone and watch will be Apple.
"this app gets worse and worse, it's not picking up workouts any more and it isn't even tracking all my steps. you are always updating but those of us who have to actually keep the same phone because we cant all afford the latest greatest phone every 2 years get outdated and it no longer works right. the same goes for the gear fit it's more impossible for it to update and goes out all the time. everything is for apple everything for android sucks. I will never be able to afford apple so....."
"That's a very great app for recording daily activities and basic gym exercises, but it'll be very great if it has the ability to record every sort of gym workout with my Galaxy Watch, if the watch doesn't support recording these advanced activities, make it just record the heart rate and we can enter the reps and weights manually. Thank You!"
"I like the new layout. I was really worried because Samsung originally announced they would be ending connectivity with other apps like MyFitnessPal. It seems like they changed their mind and left it in. As long as they keep it that way, I will continue to use this app as my primary fitness app. Nicely done Samsung!"
I am in South Africa... o am trying now for more than a week to sync my watch and samsung health to each other... it still does not want to transfer data. It shows it is connected.. it has worked fine but after update it does not want to transfer data from my Samsung gear fitt watch to the health app. What can I do... please help
"""Weight management"" is gone! Why? I've been using this app specifically because of fact that it showed the the real-time Weight management during the day (fluctuations between food intakes and workouts). None of Android or iOS alternatives can do that. Now it's gone (even from the watch now). This app and Galaxy watch became pretty useless for me..."
"It used to be good. The new ""look"" is nice but when you add food the manual adding of food and calories are no longer available I think. I can't find it anymore, if it's still there, let me know. If not, I hope you bring it back. I live in the Philippines and almost all the food listed aren't what we eat here. There are brands that are not on the list so manually adding it would be better"
I loved the app until it somehow uninstalled itself. When I installed it again I had to give certain permissions that I was not happy with. But now I understand the permissions better and can use the app for physical training. This app helped me motivate myself to pick and chose the exercises that helped me lose a lot of weight.
"Mostly works. But the fact that you can't trim/edit a workout (e.g., when you forget to stop it) is something that really should be easily added. And look, they've responded with the same generic ""we're interested in your feedback"" cut & paste comment they reply to nearly every review with. However, this is a problem with the App that you can find complaints about online going back multiple years, with no response more than the same empty words. Just add that option already!"
"The heart rate and sleep tracking in this is horrible. It used to work well but with updates is now terrible. The watch checks my HR every 10 minutes but the app only shows it every 50min-1 hour. Also the app doesn't show resting HR at all anymore, just leaves it blank. I sleep with the watch on every night and it either shows inconsistent data or just doesn't show it at all. VERY aggravating, ill be buying a Garmin watch next when this galaxy watch dies. Sucks because I do love the watch."
It doesn't let you track sleep that is inconsistent. You can only have one start and stop time a day instead of having intermittent sleep during two periods. This could be an easy fix but I've noticed it's led to me overstating sleep for the night.
"Was great, but they just removed weight management. What point is there in logging food / calories on this app without real time calorie deficit given to user as compared to at rest and exorcise calories? There are plenty of step counters. There are plenty of food diary options. The point is convenient motivation-providing data - the real time recommendation to eat more, exercise now, or know you are already on track. And you instead add community features? In a world full of social apps? Wow."
"Have you installed in this app the ability for it to tell our devices to covertly call very very particular phone numbers -and I'm not referring to app updates or device connectivity- if so, why? I did not and do not consent. As all personal communication devices have a phone app, I'm more than capable of ringing such numbers myself, so, get the covert-function removed immediately. [Same goes for that frickin inappropriately placed button thats on the device password screen & power-button.]"
"I used to love this app until I upgraded my phone to the galaxy 10+. Now it doesn't track or measure anything. If it's not compatible with my phone there should be a disclaimer. I've tried restarting my phone and uninstalling/reinstalling the app, but nothing works. Very disappointed."
"The app is comprehensive. Should help most people keep the at important health attributes. My only suggestion would be related to the food consumption area of the app. It does not allow you to set USA type quantities, such as, oz, cups, etc. Mostly shows only grams. I always have to convert to get the quanties I use to fit the app. Need to add this to the settings for this app."
"Ever since I start training (last July) I have been using Samsung Health app to track my running progress. On short distances the tracking looks ok, but the problem started when I increased my distance and time. In the last month I did 2 long running sessions of 50 kms each (I am training for marathons). Each time, at the end of the run the app told me that my total distance was around 68kms (+18 km extra). I double check the distance with Google Maps and Google Earth Pro and I always get 50 kms"
"I like everything in this app except it does not accurately show your sleep activity from the Galaxy Watch 3. Seems to never show the correct deep sleep. Always zero to 1%. My wife's Apple watch shows I'm getting anywhere from 1 and 1/2 to 2 hours sleep when worn on my other arm. I've switched arms, same result. I primarily purchased the watch to monitor my sleep. The previous update did not help, but hopefully the next update will resolve this."
"This app is amazing. Challenges, Step tracking, activity time, Food track & free programs, It's a complete fitness app. I love it. I use the app almost a year now. In my other android devices I used it. But I bought newly launched Samsung M20 device & the app didn't compatibility with this device. So, I wrote to Customer care and after 2 weeks the problem is solved. Thank you the whole Samsung Team for it from my bottom of my heart beacuse I use it everyday & I missed it."
"used to love the accuracy, now not at all. I am disabled, if you walk slow(with a cane)- it doesn't count your steps anymore, if you have heart issues- it not longer records fast rates, tells you to try again, reposition your finger, stop moving, was trying to show my dr in office, wouldn't read it, Dr's reader read 123, anything over 93 it won't read. . ."
"The app was fine until earlier today. They added the body comp info & smartwatch ad and it lost most of its color and now the workouts give different calorie counts than before. Idk if I did something or the app had an update but now it feels clunky, looks boring and is not very user friendly. üòï Wish I could attach a pic."
Words can't describe how pissed I am that Samsung has remove the weight management functionality. I became so reliant on this feature. This app is now useless to me. This left a really bad taste in my mouth. I will be thinking twice before buying another Samsung product. Be mindful before using this app as the functionality might be taken away without notice.
"After changing the data protection policy all your data is taken ransom: either you accept (forfeit) additional reduction in privacy or you cannot use the app and all your past data is not accessibile. I deinstalled the application and installed a similar one. I lost all my past data, and will never again use any Samsung application, because of the risk that from one day to the next I will have no access..."
"I am one of the many others who deleted the app do to the extensive need for a login and access to unnecessary features of my phone, like contacts, phone log etc. The copy and paste response from Samsung is just an example of bad customer understanding and service. Maybe provide software that your customers want, a light version with health tracking and no extra silly features that require us to expose our whole phone? I don't care about intention, i want control. Update:Got a copy paste reply!"
"Still my fave health app after trying all the others. Just so easy to use and handy having workouts, nutrition, steps, fitness and sleep all in one. One thing I would LOVE to add to the app, is the ability to change your macro goals, not just total calories.... then it would be PERFECT!"
Latest update wants too much in the way of permissions. It was working fine so there is no need for this change other than data harvesting on behalf of Samsung in spite of their assurances that the additional permissions are only for setup. Lots of other apps to use that are less invasive. So long Samsung!
"For the most part I'm happy with the app. What bothers me is the sleep time is off with no way of correcting it or even just have a Note box to put the actual time I've slept. I don't understand why it has me sleeping longer than I do or has times listed when I'm awake. Most food selections have to be a brand name, not just the food itself."
What happened to the oxygen saturation measuring tool? it was very handy for me to adjust my activity effort on the go. With the O2 measurement built in to Samsung Health i didn't have to carry a separate O2 device around. Can you please re enable this feature. it worked well and was accurate. An annoying development on an otherwise good phone (S10)
"Loved the app, but recently I had a lot of problems... It all started when I noticed the app was consuming an enormous amount of battery even though I wasnt oppening it. I force stopped it and the battery problem went away but the app stopped syncing with my Gear S3. I tried everything but it just didnt sync. So I unistalled it thinking it would resolve everything but the app now refuses to install. Pls help (P.S. I was able to install it, but I lost all my data from the last 2 years...)"
This was a great app but they changed the privacy policy to allow the app to make and deny calls. The reason wasn't explained in the privacy policy. I don't think it is reasonable to give them that permission so I am uninstalling. Looks like all reviewers get the same scripted non-answers when they express this concern. I'm only coming back if that permission is no longer required. Update: went the extra step and emailed the developer- got tha same canned reply.
"Sometimes my band (fit2) records a sleep, the app catches it and then it disappears. The app suggests then another recorded time without the analysis :( any idea why this might be happening? I made sure the band is in night mode Strangely, the band keeps the period time that gave the full analysis the first time"
Like others - not syncing correctly and not rewarding stars properly on the group challenges. Quite irrating
"I like it very much! Very personalized! The only thing is that there's tropical, latin style food not found on the lists, so I have to translate it into some of the listed ones, and many times the translation is inaccurate. Very limited thought if you think mexican food representens us all, latin people. I live in Ca√±azas, Panama, rural area. Love you any way, expecting you take us into account.üôÑü•∞ü¶âüå∫"
"Getting tired of Samsung products failures. Health app won't let me past the login, just spins. All the online suggestions don't work so I contacted Samsung help and go through the stop app, clear cache, restart phone & watch routine with no success. The sad thing is, I like the watch but since Samsung can't seem to fix their apps (proof is in all the reviews), this is yet another Samsung product that will end up collecting dust. I need to stop buying Samsung products altogether."
"I love this app, all of the stats are right there and easy to access, the challenges keep me motivated and I have massively upped my active time since discovering this app and getting a Galaxy Active 2 watch. The app syncs my phone to my watch so everything is right there at the touch of the screen."
"I previously reviewed this app. and gave only 1 star because it wouldn't update with data from the Watch 4. This evening, the watch actually asked me to back up my data and then reset. When I did, the problem mysteriously disappeared. I have lost workout data but happy it all works as it should now."
"Initially I used it to just track steps but once I explored what it can do, I'm using it on a daily basis to track my sleep patterns to sleep and wake at the right time, set target weight and actively managing to reduce by tracking the calorific value of the food items I intake. Very good app to be fit and healthier. It even suggests workout programs to keep you fit. Update: Can you bring a feature where weight management tracks only the steps counted by mobile or watch and not both?"
"1. The last update made the widget very small, I almost can't see how many steps I did, and there is no way to enlarge it. Is it a bug or a feature? 2. Some during the day, it stops counting steps, nothing helps. This is surely a bug üòí"
I have be very disappointed with the app. Some days it just stops counting my steps for no apparent reason. I then have to restart my phone to get it to start counting again. I lose out on sometimes thousands of steps before I notice. It has happened 2 times in the last week
"For the last week or so, my app has been ""updating"". I show NOTHING & I'm pissed off. I rebooted my phone a few times as well as uninstalled and then reinstalled. Not only did it still not work, it deleted all my previous info. I am getting rid of this garbage & find a better app for fitness. This is ridiculous."
Constant sound alerts/notifications coming from app at random intervals and I have set all of the notifications in this appto silent or silent minimized. But the app shows there are 13 notifications deleted. I am using this with the galaxy watch and Sony bluetooth headphones. I have systematically turned off notifications and the Samsung Health app is definitely generating these alerts. Please fix the app so I can control ALL notifications. This is driving me nuts. Also add a bug report.
"Really can't get into this app. My wife and I works out and we both have Samsung watches and phones and it's really hard to see her workouts on the app, Fitbit app was a little better set up to view family and friends workouts. Please look into a fix so I can go on the app and see family and friends without having to go through two and three screen."
"After the new update, I'm no longer able to log in. It forces me to set up two step verification, which I do and then it gives me an error code. Whoever coded this totally messed up because you get an error when you select the ""not now"" option for the two step verification AND you get an error code when you do set up two step verification. So now I'm logged out of my account and can't access it regardless of what option I choose. Hire better coders please."
"Love this app!! It really helps you to keep an excellent track of calories burnt as well as counting steps, but that's just the beginning, with it's extensive array of routines and great connectivity along all related devices, it makes it one hell of an app!"
"Updare: Global Challenge has a limit now, it was the only function I used and now I can not. The app is fun and great. I enjoy using the different tools to get accurate measurements. the only reason I didn't give a 5 was because I don't feel all my steps get counted and in the challenges I feel something should be done about users that already have a completed and top ranked challenge after the first day. 500,000 steps in one day is impressive."
"I have the same issue as many other reviewers--Samsung requiring me to give access to my phone and contacts to use the app. I don't care anything about the canned reassurance that it's for""optimal"" performance and they promise they won't use it for anything else. I know some people found a work-around by giving permission and then taking it back, but we shouldn't have to do that to use an app we already have. I'll be going back to Fitbit, which worked way better anyway."
"I use it paired with a Gear Fit2 Pro and it works on phone alright, but on my Tab S3 it is basically useless. Apparently and surprisingly there is no support for pairing Gear Fit with the tablet. I wish we have that, so I wouldn't be forced to use it exclusively on phone and draining the phone battery during the day."
"This app is the worst part of the Samsung Galaxy watch. There are notifications that can not be turned off about things I don't care about (activity, steps, floors climbed). The HR has never measured above 92 when I regularly ride a bike and see hours at 135+ (which it may or may not register as an activity). Stress, hahaha, never seen the needle move off the left peg. At least now the green light is off. Samsung has quick response here, upgraded to 2 stars."
"Really big fan of the app and your pursuits to make it better. While this may not necessarily be a review, I have one request. I'm in the army and we do a variety of cardio exercises. While running is a primary one we also do ruck marches. Is there a way that you can add that as a selectable workout category and also make the audio cues trackable at 0.25 miles?"
"Won't sync properly either Am now really fed up with, this App... I relented and installed the update despite feeling uneasy about the phone call issue. Now it is not syncing to my Gear Fit 2 as it used to - even forcing a sync doesn't work... Please can we go back a app release to when everything worked properly?"
"Since the most recent update my watch no longer syncs health and sleep data with the phone. Everything else is working ok, and all settings remain the same but it keeps saying the sync failed. Do I really have to unpair and delete all my data just to get it working again."
"I actually love this app. It's my favorite health app, but for the past 2 weeks it hasn't allowed me to access it. Everytime I click on it says ""access denied."" I've tried restarting the app, deleting it and downloading it again, and updating it. I don't know why this is happening. If that issue were fixed, then I could go back to enjoying it."
"This last update was a downgrade in my opinion. For weight control, ""Trend"" option and the weekly/monthly view was very useful to see the progress. I don't have these funtionalities anymore. I hope you can revert that. Thank you."
"Whatever the last update was, ruined this app. It used to be my go to but now a lot of the graphs are gone like trends by day, month and year. Also the step tracker no longer works. I walked for over an hour, phone in hand and it only is calculating 22 steps over the course of several miles. THIS is why google is taking over every internet based app. Google actually tracks my steps."
"After update, regularly opened by itself (every 5 seconds) to a screen with the message ""Can't open app. For your security, Samsung Health can't be opened on a rooted phone."" I bought my Galaxy S8 new and have never rooted it; even if I had it's absolutely ridiculous for the app to destroy the usability of a phone through unavoidable forces to an error screen. Please be more diligent about testing the usability of your products before rolling them out to public; especially pre-installed apps."
"Permission to manage calls. Don't think so. Read all the replies that this is to provide optimal experience. I'm fine with the ""sub-optimal experience"" that didn't need this level of scrutiny into my phone / contacts / abilities to make calls etc. I was going to be purchasing a new Samsung Galaxy 4 watch to replace my now quite aged Gear S3. This update will kill that purchase dead as all the functions I used to use on this app linked to my watch are now inaccessible owing to this update."
"Unstable in Android 10. This app worked great on my old Samsung s7 but was very unstable on my new Google Pixel 3A, causing the phone to slow down and crash as the app is constantly working (and crashing) in the background. I want to like it, please make it run proper in Android 10."
The app is pretty good at what it does. But it could use a few user-configurable exercise types (i.e. ability to input just a number or time with a note.) Downrated it because it wants access to Contacts to use Symptom Checker and I see no reason for that.
This is ridiculous.. so many people writing about the difficulty to log in the account but no action/ update offered by samsung. I have been facing an issue which is similar to a lot of people here. Unable to log in to Samsung health. Wrote a mail to Samsung customer care but of no use. Finally uninstalled the app. Really disappointed.
"I wish the sleep tracking was better using my galaxy watch - it claims I only get around 20 minutes of deep sleep per night at best, sometimes it's 0. It seems the app isn't able to calibrate to each individual in this aspect. Otherwise the app as a whole works well and syncs quickly with the watch"
"G9 plus. works well now, however the use of 'bmi' is not a useful way of assessing fat content in the body as it can't take into account muscle mass ratios, this is why it's no longer recognised by the medical profession as reliable. It would be great if you could use one of the other recognised ratios so it can be a truly great app. This app has helped me lose 20 kilos over 8 months."
"I am going to uninstall this app. I was my pleasure to use it all the time. But, after the last update I am asker to give permissions to access to my personal information. Why do you guys need access to my photos, videos and contacts?! That one I can not give you and that is for sure! I am very disappointed that something optional became a ""must do"" if I want to continue. I am no alone in my opinion since I don't see good feedbacks from others in the past few days after we all updated the app."
"NO: Still rubbish. Logged 15,000 steps for a 7+ mile run but only 11,240 in my daily count. I've cleared the cache (several times) I've done force stop It was NOT in power saving mode. The only thing your updates have achieved is to ruin an otherwise useful app. Please don't refer me to your ""contact us"" page as that is also rubbish and only deals with FAQs"
"Does not sync blood-pressure, and the data doesn't tell me much daily."
"A fit app that doesn't include a place to record body measurements?? Very basic stuff. How about automated measurements using the camera? How workout assistance with gym and home modes? How about... I own a top end Samsung phone, a top end Samsung Watch, TV... Wondering why. Maybe my expectations are high but we are talking Samsung not some small developer."
"This is a great app, I love it, but I gave it 4 stars and I'll explain why. For ease of use and convenience, I still use MyFitnessPal to track my food. It has a barcode scanner and a vastly superior food library. I'm just glad its able to pair up with this app and share my nutrients and caloric info because Samsung Health is much better for weight management and keeping track of my daily goals. This will hopefully become better in time."
"Just another complaint, in a long line of complaints, about the oxygen sensor being removed. I'm sure I'll get a canned response telling me to use the stress test, but it's just not the same and will not track O2 readings. Going to try uninstalling to go back to previous version of app, as I've seen a few who had success with that. Good luck getting a response from anything but an algorithm powered bot dear users üôÑ"
Edit 3/26/21: I keep checking back to see if they update it to bring back calorie tracking features and every time I check it all I see in the comments is that there have been more great features removed. At this rate it seems I'm just never going to update again and when it's time to upgrade my watch I'll have to look for a different brand...........Original update on 10/1/20: Update removed calories burned and weight management. Ridiculous as that is a large reason people use the app.
"Samsung Health doesn't work on Samsung phones... I have the A70. Tried multiple things. Nothing works. Tried calling the 24 hour hotline. It was closed. I think I'm going to have to return my Samsung smartwatch. Update: I have tried to call again as a response to their message. Despite claiming to have 24 customers service, it picks up tells you they are closed and then they hang up."
"The app occasionally erases all my active minutes except when I have set it for walking, cycling, etc. It may be happening when I restart my phone, not sure. Very annoying, especially when I just had a record week, now it doesn't say that."
"I used to like the app because it worked well with Virgin Pulse, a company benefit. Now, the app won't share data with Pulse and every time is take away sharing permissions, they keep resetting to allow all. I have uninstalled and reinstalled both apps, but the same problems occur."
"I love the app and everything but please add the snowboarding, soccer, swimming and other sports tracking possibility on the gear s3 watch.  it's ridiculous I cant track snowboarding or any other sport activity from my watch ! im giving you 5 stars hoping you'll add this feature. also i'd be happy to be able to see all my tracks and workouts  with map and stats on one page somewhere like a list. thanks for attention"
"I read the Feb. '22 watch & Health app update would provide the opportunity to create personalized running intervals via Samsung Health but if it did, I can't figure out how to do it. It does not provide the ability to set body composition targets rather than just weight, which is great!"
"I have a hard time connecting this to my fitness pal. Only the running function in exercise will feed to MFP automatically. Loving the new update, just ONE suggestion! Macro nutrients! for the love of all things holy, Please, PLEASE change the colors! Carbs & fat are both lime green with an ever so slight tint change to differentiate them! It just looks like one long line of lime green most for the time! I can barely tell the difference between the two! Please update this!!!"
I like the app very useful in tracking my meals and weight goals but i hope they include monitoring of fasting (intermittent fasting) as part of my way of eating... and scanning for QR code or bar graph to easily monitoring my macros in food intake for more convenient computation my calorie count... and this will be a perfect app... thanks to the team and more power!!üòòüíï‚ù§
"It used to be a nice app. Not the best but did its job. But recently it requested to set up the 2FA - well, it's ok. But the problem is that when I receive the code via SMS and type it in... nothing happens - the ""Verify"" button is not active. So I just can't move forward. And there's no way to skip the 2FA set up so I just can't use the app anymore. And without the app all Gear S features worth nothing. I never was a Samsung fan and this situation proves me right."
"WHAT!? Did you guys seriously remove the Weight Management tab!? You got to be kidding me! That was the one thing that made this app, that it gave you your daily intake results according to your target weight you would like to reach... Never in a million years would I have anticipated this. EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTING. Everyone I know that really uses uses this app - I don't mean for just counting steps but for actually keeping track of thier progress - lives off that feature."
"Easy-using, smart, automatic and have various kind of food and sample exercises, even the meditation. It would be 5 star if you have more kinds of food, especially Asian food and Vietnamese food. I have to input manually by searching for the quantity calo of each of materials. Thus, I hope you guys can add Cardio to Exercises."
The amount of calories burned per exercise is way to low when compared to other trackers. I'm not sure if it's a problem with Samsung's activity trackers and SmartWatches or if it's a problem with the app itself. I think it's the way they are determining how many calories you burn is flawed.
Bought the Samsung watch for weight management and now found out they have removed this key feature. What more odd is that on the watch it tells me to activate this function on the app but it is no longer there. What the hell would this be removed for. So many other fitness trackers do this and you can count calories to reach goals. Most stupid decision ever and will be taking the watch back and getting a fitbit or Garmin.
"This is a great app if your trying to lose weight. I beleive its second to none, tried others and failed. Its easy and full of great information. I don't write many reviews but this product stands out and thought it might help others. I use it every day and I'm on track for my weight loss goals. love it!!!"
"Update #1: The recommended fix to clear the cache, force stop the app and restart the phone does not work. It requires signing into Samsung Acct to access app, which has never been required. This was preloaded on the phone and has worked fine for years until this update. Original post: After the latest update, I can't access the app. Terrible since I have a Samsung phone. This follows several other updates that were undesirable. I will find another alternative. Disappointing."
"After purchase I learned that this app and watch does not work with Android phones, only with horrible Samsung phones. I called the number provided, only to learn that all galaxy watch health monitor features have been removed for all other Android phones. I've thrown away my money, based on the lies on your website and the reviews of your product. Your watch really doesn't work with Android phones."
"The app was great, but when I opened it today, it was missing the most critical section for weight loss help: the weight management roll that tells how over/under you are and shows what you've burned v. eaten. Without the tracker, this app is basically useless. Please fix that."
"App is completely unreliable and constantly stops counting my steps, at least two to three times a week. I do a lot of walking and always in the same location, thus I know what my steps should actually calculate too. Some days it only calculates half my walk, where Google Fit rarely ever has this problem. If you're looking for a reliable, acurate health app, try Google fit, avoid Samsung Health at all costs!"
"So tired of never being able to properly sync data with any other health app. Now it isn't even an option. Plus, accuracy has been diminishing. Sleep stopped tracking. This app used to be good. Now it's unusable."
Poor.. it doesnt have skateboarding which is arguably more strenuous than everyone of the listed sports it does have. And I've just come back from a trip which involved a whole lot more walking (and skateboarding) than the app suggests. So really it's just made it's own results up
"It doesnt matter the exercise, it pauses for no reason. Ive tried walking with it in my hand so nothing bumps a button and it still pauses. I cycled this morning and checked it twice and was fine. I get home and discovered that it paused. So frustrating!"
"Ruined a good app with all of the ""updates"" Also from what I can tell, because you've removed the charts from half of the items you can track, you've deleted the last 15 months of data. Not sure why then and not just everything from the last three years. Probably has something to do with you lying about switching to onedrive. I'm not calling customer service, you can relay my dissatisfaction from here."
The only thing that I find frustrating is because I synced it to my Samsung watch I can't log workouts afterwards through the app. I dont want to always log the workout through my watch as sometimes I'm not wearing it (i.e for bootcamps or crossfit). Due to this lack of feature I can't accurately track my workouts.
"I like my galaxy watch, but can't stand the interface for this app. I miss the Fitbit app and I haven't even used that for over 5 years. Their miss is designing a home page that looks like a navigation menu instead of sticking with a dashboard look."
"I was mostly using my watch to track my sleep. After the update in March 2021 everything changed. I am disappointed I have to look at my phone now or Wait for an extended time for the watch to sync to my phone for the info. I also feel it isn't reading my sleep well either. Also, i have never been able to track my steps well because i push s baby stroller. The mile plus I walk is never noticed because ""my arm didn't move."""
With the latest update it appears we have lost functionality and features. Very disappointing. Basic items like viewing historic trends has been replaced with just viewing daily data. I used to love this application over any others but unfortunately not any more.
"HOW DARE YOU?? I allowed an update and now you REQUIRE phone access to use the app at all, b/c some stupid optional Together thing? was: It's great that you can turn on the watch to be able to tell how deep your sleep is based on your heartbeat, but now what it won't do is let me edit the sleep length and it consistently decides to count as my sleeping the time when I wake up and I'm staring and messing with the phone. Hint: this app should be able to tell that I'm messing with the phone."
"Good not great, does the job. Layout is good. I wish the widgets were better and the food tracking was up to par with other apps. The food database seems lesser than other apps and there's no barcode scanner... this seems like something all the other have and it's super convenient."
"It gets stuck loading when I try to sign in. Samsung didn't solve the problem. If someone has the same issue a possible solution I found was to install a previous version of the app which you can find online, skip the login, then login once the app has started and then updating the app from the playstore"
"Overall, I really like this app. I have agree with others, I was very upset to see the weight control tab on the home screen was removed. This was my primary guide to losing 50 pounds so far this year. Please bring this back feature back really fast!"
"It's just a great app for beginners, intermediate and enthusiasts who wants to improve health habits track ad well starts it. In my opinion, professionals may get a little disappointed, maybe. To me, add a very low level beginner :) just perfect. Next improvement will be galaxy watch 46mm."
"At first the app was everything. Then it started cheating me out of steps and ruining my challenge goals. I was forced to delete it after no response from the listed contacts regarding the issues. Fix all the bugs and stop requiring a sign in to count steps and participate in health activity. Update: the app was reset by rep and unfortunately it deleted all my prior activity, accomplishments and info. The app worked properly counting steps in the leadership board. Now it's cheating steps!üò°"
"The app suddenly stopped syncing with my Discovery app (which I need for activity points). Last successful sync was mid August. Won't even link anymore. You guys changed something. Please fix it. This is the only app I can use, and it's currently not serving the purpose."
"Update has reduced my rating. The weight management feature was very useful and I'm annoyed that it was removed. Also I can bo longer see my daily activity graph for the current day unless I click on ""trends"". Its just blank on the main active time tracking sceen. This never used to happen."
I love the map when I go hiking or kayaking but wish there was a way to input exercise without having to hit start and finish. I workout every morning and have to hit start and then remember to end it instead of just putting in a time worked out. I forgot to end my workout yesterday and had to delete it because it showed 23 hours of training. Please fix this
"Great app, would track steps and store info without having to even open app. Now will definitely not use due to ""required"" permission to manage phone calls and contacts. Not buying the canned developer response. It didn't need the info for the past 5 years. Doesn't need it now. Listen to your customers samsung. I will not use this app until that is changed. For the workaround some users have used, once they have that permission, they have all your info. Not worth it."
"I use this app everyday, and loved the app before the latest update. Why would you take away one of the only differentiators to the app?! The ability to track weight management and sync it with the wearable devices was the main reason I bought the Active2. And now I see little point to the watch besides a glorified step counter."
Very poor. Will count steps if walking workout turned on but otherwise very poor counting. Yesterday I walked 3 k without turning on workout and it counted 660 steps in total for the day. Update: It has now stopped recording steps entirely. Also when workout walking turned on it pauses for no reason & does not resume. Is it possible to uninstall & reinstall it?
"Oh my gosh what has happened? I can't add exercises, I have searched and searched for the buttons and areas and now I give up! I also can't stop the three ads at the top - am I doing something wrong? Also did work out on galaxy watch and didn't record even after syncing. I used to love this!"
"While being able to record your weight, water consumption etc., have their uses, the sleep tracker (linked with my Samsung watch in thus instance) isn't very accurate, and the apps edit function doesn't let you change the times, so it creates a completely inaccurate picture of actual sleep times."
"Sleep isn't as accurate as other devices. I switched from FitBit. I've had issues in the past where it said I was working out when I was washing my hands. There was no way to stop it. I think they fixed that. My main issue is sleep. I opened the app and it said that I woke up at 8:38. I've been awake since about 7. I wasn't moving around. Just using my phone. My issue is that there isn't a way to edit my sleep record. If you hit edit, the only option is to delete. A fix for this would be nice."
"I have been using Samsung Health for several years, but i dislike the latest update , it has no option for start / stop and distance travelled in Km/miles only steps, which don't give me an idea of distance covered. i have uninstalled and reverted back to very old version, it would be better if you give the user to opt for changed version or he is happy with older version"
"Can't access this app. It tells me I need to give it permissions in Settings before it will open, but even if I allow every permission, it blocks me from opening it. It once worked fine and now it's completely non-functional."
I used to use this app all the time and it worked great. After the recent updates you no longer can sign in and the app immediately closes. Therefore there is no tracking and it doesn't function with the Samsung watch that I have. Very disappointed in Samsung's sevice
"Works good. Needs more stats. I want to know overall miles I walked or biked in a week, month, year and lifetime. Not sure why it wouldn't have this. If it does it's very well hidden. Tried active time and then trends. It has average miles but not overall."
"Just got the new note 10 plus & I wanted to use the app, but it keeps popping up saying samsung health stop working & it continues to pop up on my home screen & couldn't get it to stop even after turning phone on & off, the box just kept popping up saying samsung health isn't working, So finally I uninstalled it & now it no longer pops up. I guess the last update made it crash & errors continually. I won't be back until you guy's get this problem corrected & solve. Thank you"
Was super easy to set up on phone and for my Galaxy Active watch but I am trying to connect with my work's Wellness app so steps sync for a challenge and the app doesn't show up under Data and Permissions. Already connected to MyFitnessPal but does that sync real time or only at certain times during the day? My steps from Samsung Health for today are still not showing in My Fitness Pal.
"I like many features about this app but I am disappointed in the inaccuracies especially with the mileage. I started out walking at a brisk pace for 20 minutes and while my treadmill says I made it past a mile in that time, this app shows that I didn't even walk a full mile. This happened several times when I walked 20 to 30 minutes and can never make a mile on the app. Then I raised my time to 45 minutes to an hour and I know for a fact that I have passed 2 miles, it still shows barely a mile."
"Samsung should not force users to allow permissions for a feature they do not want (health together) and will not use. As much as i liked the earlier versions, I will not use the newer versions until this is removed. The form letter response from Samsung is insufficient and does not address the point that I have no intention of using the together feature. This feature should be OPTIONAL and, obviously, dependent on allowing phone permissions. DON'T FORCE USERS TO GIVE PERMISSIONS FOR A FEATURE THEY DON'T WANT AND WILL NOT USE!"
It was working fine until the latest Android update. Now it says that it can't work on a rooted device. Mine is not and has never been rooted. I tried uninstalling and installing again. Same error. I've tried the suggestions on others posts below about clearing cache anc uninstalling but nothing works.
Love this app! I have been useing it for almost 2 years and haven't had any issues. I also have my fit bit and smart scale connected to it. It's also very easy to enter in food. It's nice knowing what nutritional value you are getting through out the day. The one thing I would add is to also keep track of all vitamins. Please consider this in next update üòä
"I don't know what to make of it yet. I know that security settings have complicated everything, but I suppose they are necessary. I often feel like I don't know what I am doing when I grant all these permissions or allows or why they are needed. I have also had some trouble getting clear about whether my watch is registered as well as my phone. All the terms become increasingly confusing and all too often I wonder if I have messed the whole thing up just answering the required questions. Swimming in the dark. The app works fine, but its functions are not clear to me."
"It used to be great but all of a sudden it's not recording steps accurately. For example, I have a route I do at lunchtime that's pretty much 6000+ steps. For the last couple of days it's been about half that yesterday and 4700ish today. And it's the EXACT same route"
"app has ruined my phone and made it impossible to use. i dont use this app but suddenly (started at 2am central time on the dot today) i keep gettong a full screen error message that closes whatever i am doing telling me ""app cant open on a rooted phone"". My phone is not nor ever has been rooted. i have gotten the error message nearly 20 times just writing this review so far. i literally can not do anything on my phone now because it keeps popping the error every 5-10 seconds."
"This app is completely useless.You can't measure anything,it just comes up with its own bs you can't change.Can't put any other details in except food,coffee & water.It does nothing unless you're in a group,which I can't do cuz I can't do their exercises to keep up with them when I have disabilities. If it didn't threaten to make other apps unresponsive,I'd delete it fast. Was way better when I had the Samsung galaxy8,could measure anything easy & manually. Very disappointed now"
"I used to enjoy this app, but with a recent update, it no longer tracks steps or records data. I've cleared the cache, restarted the phone, uninstalled and reinstalled the app. Still nothing. There are a lot of other fitness apps and step trackers out there."
"My tracker no longer syncs with the updated app, grrrr....doesn't sync with Fitbit anymore, either...grrrr. tracker sync issue seemed to resolve but now back... mobile device won't track steps now, as well! seriously, fix this app! ok...app does not sync with activity tracker! so, no steps from the activity tracker and sleep.is not recorded! Mobile device is now tracking steps and recorded activity such as walking and yoga. still needs work!"
"The app is good, the only thing that I find annoying is there is nowhere to track if you're ill, so it makes you feel like you're being lazy, plus I've also found just lately it isn't tracking my steps/workouts correctly. I'm getting quite disheartened with it and have been tempted to uninstall it a couple of times üò©"
This was once a great app with a weight loss feature that helped you balance your calories with activity level. It really helped me change my lifestyle and make informed decisions about food and exercise. For some reason it's gone! Now it's basically worthless.
I have had this setup on my phone barely 5 days. Did good days 1 & 2. The days following showing steps taken getting less. Today 0 steps shown. I've done a bit of steps today. Since it's not working right I'm just removing the app from my phone. I may try this app again later. Apparently this can't be uninstalled. Gave the option then midstream the app changed that option. That's all.
"I normally dont write reviews but this really bothers me and I want it fixed. Ive been using Samsung health primarily to record my runs and so I could have a pretty accurate log of them but after the last system update or whatever update this happened on, I cant figure out how to view my older runs. I click on the run icon and it only shows me the past 30 days. Even if they still exist Im upset that your app isnt very user friendly anymore. You should change it back to how it was before because this new setup is a. Not visually appealing and b. Not user friendly."
"App steps count does not work all the time. When doing exercise, walking I have found many times when looking at steps it stopped counting and when shaking hard it will work again. Disappointing when doing 4 km it only record just about nothing if you do not continue checking and shake to wake up again."
"After latest update I can no longer change my sleep wake and bedtime, nor can I add another time if I go back to sleep or nap. I did read in another review that you responded to to clear the cache and restart my phone. Which I and it still didn't fix it. Please fix this as it's a feature I use everyday."
"I bought a 2nd hand Galaxy S6 edge plus. It works great and It's an awesome phone except when I first got it, I tried to use S Samsung Health and Pay. It will not allow me to open them as ""Unauthorised Modifications have been made"" I only have software that came with the phone. I've checked Multiple times if its rooted but its not rooted. I factory reset it a few times but that did nothing which is disappointing since I did intend on using those Pay and Health. Many thanks. Joel"
"Calories counting is not correct compared to the real calculation..(,during running exercise) Showing very less."
I use this app everyday. I was very upset to see that the weight management was taken away. This feature helped me so much with my progress. Please put it back or offer another app that has the feature. I would have given a favorable rating before the Aug 5 update. The one of the best features on the Samsung Health App.
Good way to track everything but I think it would be easier to enter food entries if there was a bar code scanner for food. It's hard to find foods by name and a little confusing. Sleep tracker is not working properly when connected to my watch.
"Please include the ability to manually input your heart rate. I don't know why there is the ability to measure blood glucose, and blood pressure, but not heart rate. Will rate 5 stars if that is added, because this is by far the best fitness app I've tried. Would love love love the ability to track my heart rate without needing to purchase a seperate device and sync with the app."
"The step counter has stopped saving data from 5th oct onwards. It counts steps correctly through the day but after midnight forgets data of previous day. 3 phones in my home started showing identical problem. The historical data is intact till 4th Oct. Update on 11th Oct, 2020 - the software seems to be fixed now. Started working fine this morning again. Thanks to Samsung for fixing it."
"""No SIM card detected. Insert a SIM card and try again. (0x21)"" This app is useless unless you have a SIM card apparently. Edit: Thanks for the reply. Seems like those functions could be done over wifi.....maybe there's something special about a SIM card I'm missing. I suppose you could say my scenario is unusual in that I want to use the app on a device that is not my primary smart phone. In this case, the app cannot be used. Thanks again Edit #2: Take a SIM card from another device, place it in the one you want to use with the health app. Login on the app. Remove the SIM card. The app will stay logged in and working....for now at least. Review upped to 3 stars now that the app is usable"
"Will not allow use of note 10's O2 sensor. Samsung just wants to sell you more expensive junk add ons!!! Adware, extremely hard to navigate and like a big sister it takes you everywhere except where you want to go. Screw u Samsung.... Samsung tech support never solved one problem yet. Google search and/or playing with myself. Get real, there's no fixing this just like there's no fixing the missing 3.5mm jack or latest BT chipset!!!"
"Why did the spO2 sensor disappear? It isn't even in my list of options anymore. The stress function is not available in my country, and even if it was I would not be okay with the loss of this functionality. The Sp02 sensor is extremely helpful when managing respiratory diseases such as asthma and COPD. Measuring stress is not helpful when all you want to know is your oxygen saturation. At this point I am going to uninstall all updates and disable the application."
"OK, but a bit MEH. I'm sure this version (Oct 7th?) drains the battery a lot more than the previous version. It (or the galaxy watch) tries to guess sleep patterns, so isn't all that accurate. Basically if you're a fat knacker and can't be arsed getting up on Sunday morning and decide to mess about on the Internet until lunch, it will count a lot of this time as actual sleep, which is wrong."
"It would have been good if the app had a water reminder. You can simply update the number of glasses of water you drink during the day but there should've been an option to set reminder for water. Also, a widget for the same would have been great."
"Something happened to the app since the last update. Used to count steps if I walked a few feet back and forth, but now it missed lots stops. I have a job where I walk very short distance quite frequently and the stops stopped recording even though I've been on my feet the whole day."
"Why is sleep monitoring so inaccurate? It shows the time i fall asleep 1-2h before i actually do even though I'm using my phone all this time so it's no magic figuring out that I'm not sleeping. Even though i turn off the internet and set alarm through my watch 2h later, next day i see the app thought i had been already sleeping for two hours. That should be really simple to fix! Disappointing. Plus the huge ads on top are ridiculous. I already have the phone and the watch and the earbuds."
"I can't use it anymore without a Samsung account. I don't want my health data in the cloud. I thought Samsung was a phone manufacturer, now it is turning in to a big data collector. I am very disappointed! *edit: thanks for the response, I hope this will be resolved soon. It would restore my trust in Samsung *edit the new update doesn't resolve the issue. Any ideas when it will be resolved?"
"I have not found an app to do what this one does. It has all the food I can think of from the stores I buy, even any homemade soups, etc. May not be 100% but much closer than any other app & free too. I wish it would link with my cheap tracker since I don't always have my phone on me, but I can live with that. It does help me stay in check at least. I will be sharing this app with siblings struggling with weight during these times...also, I am a senior as are they"
"I pretty much liked this app but I didn't like having an article recommended to me about mass shootings, asking me to subscribe to Scientific American to read the complete article, particularly when the one paragraph shown was using inaccurate 10 year old data and was obviously pushing a narrative. Stay out of the political arena. I am disappointed in sleep monitoring using Samsung watch active. It doesn't appear to be at all accurate."
It's great. Love the challenges. I just wish the workouts were designed better. One training session is made up of different clips that are looped over and over. Maybe even have actual exercise classes.
Latest update took away features that I was relying on for weight loss. Such as the weekly and monthly weight record. This app was very helpful and would have been 5 stars until the latest update. I hope this features can be replaced soon or I'll have to look for a different app.
"Update1: 12Jun21. Tried all steps you mentioned, issue not resolved. Inform your developer to check steps counter and GPS counter, its not in sync and has huge discrepancy. Issue: 05Jun21 There is a km calculation difference between steps and walking under exercise options, which is illogical. Same distance of walking, but two different reading shows the fundamental discrepancies in the app."
Stopped allowing 3rd party developers access to development mode. Syncmytracks was keeping me using Samsung health now I have to find an alternative Update: thanks for getting back to me but I don't want to call your support line. You took a product management decision to stop 3rd party support-this takes away the only reason I use Samsung health. I have stopped updating all apps automatically to use an older version of you app that supports syncmytracks.
The last android update or app update makes it totally unreliable when tracking workouts. I used the app to record my walks as workouts daily and now it's just randomly auto pausing the workout even while I am still on the go. All graphs and updates are pretty awesome but this bug makes it unusable to track my workouts. Pls fix it
I have used this app over the last 14 months to lose 90 pounds. The weight management feature was most useful but was removed with the last update. I'm very unhappy as now my weight loss has stalled and this last 10 pounds is going to be extra difficult without that weight management calculator. Please put it back!!
I used to love this app until the newest update (6.15.0.091). They took away a lot of the features I liked (e.g. nutrient scores/goals) and still don't have essential features that should have been included in an update (e.g. daily and weekly caloric deficits -- for those trying to lose weight).
"UPDATE 8/19 - response to your second referral to CS at that phone number.... Why? Why would I call again? Y'all are nutzo. These poor agents at CS! They can't help us. Please try again :-) .............. (original) Grrr. I have happily been using your app exclusively for years. The font is now SO small in the workout stats! You increased the overall distance, great. Then you shrunk the details font to a point that I have to screenie it to read it. Who does this serve? Even increasing the general phone font doesn't help. So...YOU help! Also, consider adding SUP /paddleboard to the workouts. I do like that ""My Stress"" saves HR to the individual tracking. Thanks, hope to hear from you. üôÇ ..............8/17 UPDATED: I called the phone # you suggested and the agent was very nice. She checked with 'management' and there is nothing you will do, it's not getting changed. SO, you lose a star and a customer. I don't know who approved that change or why, but it's a deal breaker. Bummer. I was going to get the watch! GRR!"
Very disappointed. Works perfectly on my Samsung watch Active watch and A5. It was updated when installed it on my new A10 last week and just fell apart. No stress. Incorrect heart and sleep. Perhaps it's because I have the original watch and it was the wrong update. I've slung my watch in a drawer and gone back to my original Huawei elcheapo.
"ok app, too many taps to get to exercise, won't read other wear devices (unless they are samsung i guess) and the notifications...dang i had to turn almost as off to stop this app bothering me and draining battery. Does anyone have problems with heart rate etc. i don't know if it's my finger or the sensor but it often decides to just measure noise and won't work? faulty sensor? otherwise ok app once you get control of it. wish it synced with Google fit, could recognise cycling automatically then"
Still see no point in answers below with regard to access to phone calls. It's weird because app worked fine a few days ago and features were implemented. Regret upgrade now so advise that you don't. Standard response below does not explain why a month ago was fine? Email doesn't work (noreply) & phone number has no country code! Thanks
"I really liked this app a lot when I got my phone back in November, but the updates seem to move the app backwards in time. Not happy that you can't do your SpO2 levels separately anymore. I have asthma, and don't need to be doing a pretty useless stress monitor every time I do my SpO2. Stop taking things away Samsung!"
Others talk about mapping but I certainly can't find any option to map? Also we have strived for accuracy by tracking known distances! I am 180cm tall but even setting my height at 155cm it still shows higher than actual distances. Okay if it could actually measure distances. We walk 4.5 to 12kms every day. üëç
"Pretty good, but it seems confusing that the notification for a medal doesn't always open the medal (goes to the most recently viewed tracker instead), and the medal tab was removed from each tracker, making them hard to find. (I already reviewed, but it seems I can't edit my review)."
Loss of features is a huge hit for this. I recently bought a new watch and if I knew the calorie and weight tracking system was removed I would have gone with something else. I don't see how the developers could see removing this would be a good thing. Terrible... üò†
Login is terrible! it doesn't integrate with Lastpass. I can't copy passwords to the app. There is no single-sign-on option. Samsung - it's the 21st century. Update your tech!! UPDATE: Called software support. Apparently SSO is native only on Samsung devices. So Samsung needs to either fix/update the ancient HTML form on Samsung Health or figure out a way to integrate a Samsung account with a non-Samsung phone.
Very good add if your in the Samsung ecosystem of fitness tracker (eg: smart watches) how ever works very well with other 3rd parties. I hope they can expand more on 3rd party support especially with garmin. I would advise they add a exercise recovery trackers. But overall it's one of the best app you get for free. They could grow to dominate other streams in sport (eg. Cycling and running platforms like strava etc) I really love it
This app came with the phone and for years I have been using it to track my steps automatically. I just upgraded to the latest version May 2020. It no longer consistently tracks my steps. I can walk a mile and there are 0 steps. This new version does not work correctly and needs to be fixed.
"It's alright at tracking steps and heart rate during the day. But don't expect it to track your sleep properly. Its absolutely shocking. Whether it be my galaxy watch or the app, but it's so frustrating. My fitbit worked better. And thank you Samsung for the reply to this but I'm in the uk so i won't be ringing that number!!!."
"Hello, Samsung! I am hear with entreaty of adding localization or language setting for food list. That's awesome the language connected with shop goods, but I use my phone in English and the app too, the same time I am locating in Russia now, and it's not useful for me to entire some food manually, especially when it's only 100 places."
"Disappointed with lack of accuracy of the food nutrition tracking. Iron levels in certain food are missing for example milo, calcium content is incorrect or missing for example milk. Fibre is also incorrect.I took the time to enter my food as accurate as I could hoping to reflect a true outcome of my day. Also only being able to choose 3 excercise choices is very limiting as I often switch up what I do daily."
"Was perfect and very useful. Developers removed weight management portion where calories burned, overages, etc. were calculated; that data was useful for meal planning, etc. Without it, this is just another pedometer and exercise recorder. When purported improvements make a product worse, a company needs to reflect on their decision makers."
Its an ok app. The food tracker part needs some work. Most brands i buy are not avaliable to search for and the results i do get are not even close to the same making it hard to track what iv eaten. It would be cool if i could take a picture of the product and its ingredients and like upload it to the app so i have all my brands and i know exactly what iv put in my body. Other then that its a good app to track exercise and water intake.
"Can't get it set up. Created account, tried to turn on 2FA, it won't accept any code I enter in. As in, the verify button won't do anything. So I try to not turn on 2FA, when I enter my password it gives me some error. Tried uninstalling and installing again, same thing. Updated to add: Samsung responded and said, basically, follow the process that does not work. Unhelpful. However, I was able to get the stupid thing to work via the website"
"I used to love this app. But when I got a new phone, Samsung S8 in September 2019, it has not worked properly. Does not track my running distance accurately, and no longer shows the map of my route after each run. Can the developers fix this? Has anyone else had these problems?"
Now lost step count and other measurements after my Samsung S6 updated this latest version- really not good enough... Thank you for the reply-the only part that worked was to select Force Stop on the app in application manager- this brought the step count and other measurements including previous weekly summaries.It looks like the app causes data to be recorded in the background but app doesn't show any of the data collected unless you select force stop...
"I use it with my Galaxy watch, which is incapable of doing basic things like counting steps properly, so, useless. Edit: Looks like you check these reviews, Samsung is neglecting all the issues with the GW. You should acknowledge them and fix them, so far this watch is a scam, it can't do what it is advertised to do. Check the web and you'll see loads of people reporting the same bugs."
I'm done with Samsung all together. Need to terminate the employment of the developers who the changes over the last year. Getting rid of my phone tomorrow. There is absolutely nothing useful on this app anymore. Still garbage Was hoping the developers would have made changes. Does anyone know about macro tracking. True carb counts and so on. Subtracting fiber from carbs to get that number. Can't do that now. This was a huge reason I had Samsung. I get a free upgrade on my phone soon. 6 weeks.
"This app used to be so good! :( I loved using this app to check my ""stress"" and blood oxygen using the phone camera, but now I have to use an external device. It's auto tracking features are either not there anymore or don't work properly. I might as well open a spreadsheet app and log everything exactly how I want it because there aren't any useful features anymore."
"The Fitness section is empty now. üòÆü§îü§îü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è You used to be able to access different subjects to help you, for example music to help you relax & sleep. üôÇüëç It was a great all-round app. Now all of it is gone. Where? üòù Might look for a more complete app."
"Overall, it is a pretty complete app. It will be good if there is good tracker for HIIT or circuit training. The kcal burned for a 30 minutes 3.3km run is much higher than kcal burned for a 45 minutes intensive circuit training. (Note: The above run are tracked using both Samsung watch and phone and the results came out the same; circuit training result is from Samsung watch only)"
"I have tried uninstalling and redownloading but nothing works. I have a Pixel 3. When I open the app and it asks for my samsung ID, I put it in and the page starts loading but just keeps loading forever. It's just black with the green and blue spinning circle. EDIT (2/1/21) works now!!"
"Whoever decided to turn the UI into the abomination that it is now needs to be lined up against a wall and dealt with, everything has been made to look fancy and compressed and is clearly designed for users on spectrum. Trash app. Wish I never updated."
"Just got this active 2 smartwach. The app and watch are totally inaccurate. Never shows live heart beat, or accurate sleeping times. Stress never shows. Garmin and fitbit are on top of there trackers and apps. Samsung has been lacking from there app to phones to accessories. I'm totally disappointed and that's that. You as a person will understand how good something will work for you and if it's worth it. Totally sad"
"Very useful in tracking weight loss progress but could be even better :) 1. Could you have the ""calories burnt at rest"" for the entire day estimated in the beginning of the day then adjust over time? Otherwise the weight management status always turns from ""good"" to ""under"" without me noticing because the calories burnt at rest is being gradually added. It barely varies each day anyway so if it's added in the beginning it would be much easier to plan things 2. Could add female period tracking"
"When I was using Note 9, the Samsung health was wonderful and very helpful. And I enjoyed the app. But unfortunately after I switched to note 10+, I find that usefulness of this app has completely lost and now its only a burden on the memory of the phone. This is a glaring example of negative progress of an app."
why did you remove anyway of just O2 8 in Canada. this makes me want to avoid Samsung when features like this are taken away??? *Reply* I understand that but it's a fairly straightforward feature that was removed all of a sudden. I've reversed your update installed the older version and blocked updates and have it back. When you have feature on a phone and remove it regardless of the legality it's not right without a better explanation. Huawei it is next phone bye!
"This app is useful when it is in sync with my watch, but it rarely syncs up. No matter how many times I troubleshoot it with customer service the problem continues and is really getting old having to wait for it to sync up, if it ever does."
I'm really disappointed that I can't view my heart rate throughout the day or over a period of exercise. The heart rate graph on the fitbit app was the most useful for me - it is one of the most important elements of fitness. Now I cannot see which parts of a run really got my heart going. The graphs on the Samsung health give me far less information and seem use averages over longer periods of time (e.g. over an HOUR). Love my galaxy watch but will have to think again based on quality of app.
I have been using this app for ages and it links to my gym app ( my wellness ) but all of a sudden I keep getting the following error message ( the Samsung health app is not installed or is out of date. Data synchronisation with samsung health will not be functional until issues are resolved ) I have uninstall both apps and checked for updates. I'm confused. Has anyone else bad this error message?
"I can track various components of my well being (workouts, steps/distance, food/water, stress, etc...) to help improve my overall wellness. The monthly challenge encourages movement. This app does more for free than what noom does for a fee. S Health helps me maintain my ""sexy"" and for that, I'm grateful!"
The app is good but needs a much broader integration with more devices. I measure both glucose and ketones with a Keto Mojo meter and use a Levano wireless scale for weight. I would love to be able to import heath data directly into the Samsung Health app. I would also like to see a fasting log available that tracks biomarkers against various points in the fast.
Every time there is an update the app stops letting me input exercise data. It's a shame because it's a really good app otherwise. But without being able to input exercise data I can't track my exercise and see if I'm reaching my targets.
"The app has a new stress feature yet, there is no measure button. It is a wasted screen. I would love to track my stress but first this app needs to actually work properly. I am very disappointed. I did not hear from samsung with my last review, should you want help troubleshoot(as you have with other users) I would appreciate that."
"Used to be decent but not any more. Could do SpO2 readings from front screen (useful for asthmatics) but now have to ""measure stress"" - when I do that, the app hangs, even after reinstalling!!! Dunno is my stress blowing the app or is it just another poorly coded app that removes handy functionality for an ugly looking declutter!"
"I usually really like the app, for me the best part was getting sleep notifications in the morning. for some reason, it's not tracking my sleep automatically anymore. I don't use any accessories just the phone. I wonder if it's due to being put in deep sleep or something"
Dislike the new color scheme. It is too hard to distinguish at a glance the macronutrient percentages or the lines in the weight/fat% line graph. Plus it's just kind of ugly. Good app for monitoring diet and exercise in general.
"I'd give it zero stars if possible. I wasn't expecting anything fantastic by any means but got far less. The heart rate monitor is next to impossible to use. No matter how still I sit, no matter how perfectly I position my finger over the scanner, it still doesn't work. Out of 10 tries to get it to measure, I MIGHT get 1 reading and that's if I'm lucky. By the time it does take the measurement, my heart rate has long since returned to normal. My advice, invest in a fitbit!"
Unable to track calories. I can't add more than one food item for a meal. **update** I called the support number and nobody answered. It put me on hold with some music for 5 minutes and then went to silence. This sucks cause some of the other features are useful.
With the recent update it seems the running coach is back! That was one of my favorite features and so glad it is back. You really need to do a better job advertising it! It was a shame when it went away. I love hearing if I am hitting my pace. Still no HIIT training and need cadence for stationary bike.
"I really enjoyed using this app and it's helped me to consistently lose weight over the past 2 months. I even bought the Samsung Fit E to help track my exercise better. However after today's update I am very dissapointed you have removed the Weight Management feature. This was a great way of tracking how low on calories I was, and what I needed to burn off. Now its gone S Health just feels like a glorified step counter rather than a Health App, hence you've lost some stars"
"It is a pain to record every single little thing you eat, but if you do, it's totally worth it! This app helps you keep track of if you're overeating or if you're on track. It's simple to calculate how many calories you need to burn by how long is left until midnight (when it records it in the log for the day). I've lost 4.4 lbs in the last month thanks to this wonderful app!"
"App doesn't work after latest update. Had to roll AAaalll back to the factory version. üòï Update: The problem is fixed, and my updated app is now working. Thanks. PS. I, personally, prefer the layout & features of the previous version of this app, but it's still a good app."
I just purchased a samsung watch and I have a google based phone which I was told wouldn't be a problem. Everything else works great with my new smart watch except this app. It won't even let me sign in for the first time. It just spins. I've troubleshot loads and may have to take the watch back. Im not sure yet. What good is a health and fitness watch if I can't even view my info properly?
"It's a good app, but the option to manually put your hours of sleep in does not let you confirm it. I have tried it on data and WiFi and it will still not let me confirm it. Otherwise an all round good app, it is pretty accurate at most the readings."
cant use the app since apparently the device requires a SIM? cant see why my fitness app requires access to the cell network. why cant this be run on tablets? After samsungs comment on the above; I can only assume they forgot about the existance of wifi or other ways to obtain data conections. Also there people who just want to view their workout data and have no need or want to share that data with friends especially in an up to the second way that a network conection would allow
Long time Apple user and just recently made the switch to a OnePlus 8 and purchased a Samsung Galaxy Watch 3 as well. This app has never worked on my phone. Ever! So I have a new Samsung watch and the app won't even open on my phone. The only replies I see from Samsung support on here is to call or clear cache and restart your device (that doesn't work). Thinking I should have got the Garmin watch instead. Update: Don't call! Waited 30 minutes both times. Customer service is as bad as this app
"No longer syncs steps and activity with MyFitnessPal. Under Armour (Who own MFP) have said that this is an issue with Samsung Health, and not their app. Very disappointing as this used to work. I can see by other reviews that I'm not alone in experiencing these problems. Please fix this Samsung, and I will change my review."
"I really liked this App up until about 2 months ago when I guess updates were made. Example, one day last week I walked more than 14,000 steps. It showed that to be like 6.5 miles. The next day it only showed the steps I accumulated at work. Some times it doesn't even store the days I work. I have Uninstalled the app and now researching for something better. A few years ago this was a great App. Not now. Those that are continually trying to make things better usually end up making them worse."
"I love this app. Superb user experience, a lot of content, and great motivation."
"I have been using this app for a few years and liked some of the up dates, however this latest update is a downgrade. Ever since the update, I have not been able to log onto my account, everytime I try it keeps putting me to settings for allowing permissions and one is to allow my contacts, umm why? I just want to access my account."
"After my A40 downloaded the latest upgrade, it started only counting a fraction of the steps I take. The standard advice you are giving out (stop counting, start counting, clear cache, force stop) has no effect. Please get your developers to sort out whatever mistake they have made."
"Works okay, could sync better with the Samsung fit-e, on the S10 the pulse oximeter gives spO2 readings which should mean I would be gasping for breath and in need of immediate medical care (such as 85%) the ""stress"" option is about as accurate as a mood ring and even if I set up a no-step workout (such as using a rowing machine) my Samsung fit-e and as such the app still counts steps, while my feet are literally strapped down. Get it together Samsung!"
"Bad experience! Samsung claims this will enhance the user experience in relation to the 'together' feature. I do not use this. I do not know what it is. My own user experience is that I had been using this app for years quite happily. Samsung then randomly demanded seemingly unrelated permissions with no justification and which, it claims, will not affect my experience in any way. My penalty for not complying? I lose access to all my historical data and some of the functionality of my phone."
12 years ago I had a horrible accident that left my vocal cords paralyzed. I have been buying samsung phones because the app had an spo2 ( pluse oximeter) which made it so easy for me to check to make sure my oxygen saturation didnt deviate to much. They took that out of the samsung health app 2 months after I bought the note 9. It left a bad taste and I don't think I'll be sticking with samsung anymore.
I like this app but I wish that it had a Vitamin/Supplements section though to help record nutrients. I'm using Green Tea Fat Burner & it's awesome in my diet plan! Also it would be great if I could scan bar codes on food because some food I entered doesn't have the same nutrition information as on the package which creates inaccurate counts. It definitely helps me to want to exercise more so I can see progress results!
"The best fitness app ever! Helped me on my fitness journey for 3 years. Best fitness companion during the lockdown. A variety of training programs inspired me to try new fitness regimes. Lost 10 kgs at home, thanks to this app. I cannot say the same for the different gyms I went to."
"This app went from one of the best in business to trashy, ad-oriented app. Samsung removed almost all functionalities from this app. Before I was able to measure my blood oxygen level, as well as UV intensity. Now my note 8's sensors are useless. In my opinion, Samsung tries to persuade people to buy their other hardware to keep track of health. I can gladly assure you, I will not buy smartwatches or related health trackers from Samsung after knowing what they deliberately did to this app."
"Used to really like using this app, but with recent changes and the fact that you deleted me from the April challenge for doing too many steps!! The reason for the amount of steps was that I had to factory reset my phone and the amount of steps going back in were from a backup, and yet there are users that complete the challenges in a day.. yeah right 100,000 steps in a day and that's acceptable!!, Think I'll stick with Google fit. and no thanks I don't intend to call you on the number supplied."
"There are key points missing, but my rating is based on the monthly walks. Its extremely discouraging to be against people that complete the 200,000steps/month goal the first day. My battery doesnt even last long enough to get 50,000 a day. Maybe break us down into categories based on our average steps. Or groups by size based on when we sign up for the monthly walk. Sounds stupid but it would push people to interact with the app more if we had a chance at winning the silly badge."
"Disabling syncing of steps from third party applications It used to be really helpful especially for those who have the PhilAm Vitaliy program. Existing Mi Band 4 is no longer syncing with Samsung Health, and you cannot take the phone while on a jog. I hope you bring back the features that helps connect this app with all other applications."
"I used to love this app. But now it is not sync with my Gear S2. It not cost-effective to buy a new watch when there are cheaper watches in the market doing the same basic functions (step counter, exercise tracker, sleep tracker, etc.) that most of us use."
"Subpar. I wish I had known that you can only look back on 30 days of exercise before I bought the watch and before my returns window was up and this app let's the watch down in my eyes. I'm the kind of person who likes to look back over time not just 30 days, there is no way I am messing about downloading and uploading to another app to keep this data. Fitbit outstrips Samsung on the app front, it's a shame as I love the style of the watch."
"Decent tracking app. Only issue with the latest update: I don't appreciate seeing when my next period may start basically as soon as my current one has! I don't see a way to set up an alert for me to get moving after sitting for an hour, think that would be a nice option."
"I really like this app. It helps me to see how active I have been, let's me compare myself to similar I individuals and probably most important it helps me stay motivated! Only slight negative is sometimes I question its accuracy particularly keeping track of steps through out a day. However it does seem fairly accurate recording workouts."
"No, why have you removed weight control, this was one of the best things about the app. It really helped me lose weight last year. Was great to be able to set an amount you wanted to lose and it would adjust your calorific allowance. Please fix it!! Other than that its a 5 star app."
"Ever since the last update the app doesn't sync correctly with my watch. Steps are different on both, it doesn't auto detect workouts anymore despite being enabled and the sleep tracker no longer seems consistent. I've tried clearing the cache and reinstalling but to no avail."
It just couldn't sync to my galaxy watch anymore after updated. All the workout data still record in my watch but my apps got nothing on it. Another thing is my watch stop counting after I workout for 10 min. Like it just stop track the time and only record for 10min when I do boxing for 30min or more. Is it sth can be fix? please help me out if it does. Thanks
"Happy with the app. But Samsung watches from Gear Fit+, Sport, S3 and the latest Gear (S4) all are SERIOUSLY flawed in tracking my swim! Single swim lap often counted as double laps, often not counted at all! On one occassion I noted 4 laps in a row was not counted at all. Horrible. Tracking run is good."
"Really great app, I use it to log my meals which allows me to monitor what I'm eating and adjusts my meals where necessary...I use it to monitor my activity level, record and track my menstrual cycle, weight, sleep pattern...not to mention all the other things I can visit for..its a really great app...very satisfied with it."
"I think its quite a handy app n i use it as often as i can, but i wish they had an option for pregnancy because it keeps telling me I'm overweight when its just pregnancy. But its great to help keep track with excercise during this time as it can get hard to keep track of."
"Will y'all ever fix the water intake unit of measure? 8.4 ounces? How about we have an option to put exactly how many ounces. They removed weight management and added daily activity. I still miss weight management and I think the daily activity isn't the same. Overalls with the addition of daily activity, I've returned to using the app. For a bit there I wasn't using it at all because it made the app useless as there are better food tracking apps."
"Love getting the step count although I have seen it go up a step or so when it's jostled, or I'm in an elevator. The entire section on fitness exercises etc are videos of ripped women in tiny exercise clothes and like, I get it, inspo, & diet + fitness culture is marketed to women, but maybe some ""all shapes"" focus on healthy bodies and maybe a woman wears a full shirt occasionally....just sayin', it's 2021. Not a bad app overall, but I do prefer my Fitbit because it can track better & more."
The stair tracking is way off it only captures about half of what I do. I would like water intake to be tracked by oz not glasses. I like output on food consumed but would like it to be easier to enter food. I would like individual exercise videos not just programs that are multiple days.
This app was great. The last release removed bpm and stress measurements and added tracking menstrual cycle and fertility. Yeah just what every man needs. I understand that it may benefit females but bpm and stress measurements benefit both genders. If it is not broke don't fix it.
I'm using Samsung healthy for over two years and was very happy with it until the last update. Now I'm very disappointed with the weight features. I loved the trends and it was also useful to see the BMI. The only nice thing about the latest update are the sleep features. Best regards
I love the app and I use it all the time. With a few issues here and there but it WAS fine. Now I know Sammy will remove the trackers for Water/Coffee and Weight... I'm SAD as I used those functions. Will switch out to better apps as now Health has lost its value to me. Same trackers with cheaper Phones and Watches. NOT GOOD.
"Advanced Features of Galaxy 4 do not work with my Pixel 3 phone. Is Samsung planning to release an update to enable support for blood pressure, blood oxygen level (SpO2), VO2 Max, irregular heartbeats, body composition, and sleep tracking to work on my non- Samsung Android phone? This is Wear Os watch is useless if it cannot even work with a Pixel phone."
"I loved this app before the update, but now I can no longer monitor my heart rate after exercise, which was awesome because I didn't have to switch apps and could keep all the data together. I also have an issue with it now needing permissions to make phone calls. Update ruined this once very useful app."
I am not keen on the new layout for exercises as I now just keep scrolling through the list of types of exercises. Before I tap/selected the ones I use and they appeared on the front dashboard. Please re enabled this function as all I needed to see was on the front dash board.
"Tried it, but I think I'll go back to my previous fitness app because it has a handy feature that allows me to scan a barcode on foods to input all the nutritional info. I have to spend time searching for foods in the Samsung app, which takes more time than I like."
"Such a horrible update! Sorry Samsung but I cannot use the app anymore for food tracking. We can't see the total grams of our macros intake, removed again the automatically saved food meals from the previous days (very helpful for meal prep) and the layout is so confusing. Bring back the old version ASAP!"
"Generally this is pretty comprehensive, I like the app and will continue to use it. However, your fluid intake (E.g. caffeine and water, with their own sections) doesn't link to your diet information. And most frustratingly: you cannot add workouts after you've done them! VERY POOR FAULT IN THE DESIGN! In the food section, although it covers lots of brands, there often isn't an option for 'homemade', when you're in to fitness and your nutrition you are going to be making food from scratch"
"I used to love the previous version not sure why is the obsession with ""updates"" to something that works just well and noone asked for updates of any kind The look, the interface, the user friendly feats, all changed not for the best It's just like android calls log for example, somebody had the ""great idea"" to put a drop menu for the calls log and you had to select 'all calls, all messages, all logs, all missing calls...' etc it never stayed where you selected something, always changed üòï"
"It's probably one of the best Health and Fitness Tracking apps. I like the design, the fact that you can manually enter data, the fast food logging, and the Heart Rate and Stress Logging options. What I DON'T LIKE: 1) Lack of a Web based platform to check the logged data. 2) Lack of Step Stride Length Customisation 3) Lack of Quantity Choice when adding your own foods 4) Lack of Sleep Tracking Data 5) Lack of detailed Body Measurement History 6) Difficult Exercise Logging (for a gym athlete)"
Inaccurate step count. Worst part is it doesn't detect floor count no matter how many floors you walk. I always compare step count and floor on the both my devices end of the day and apple data is more accurate than samsung. Samsung health needs improvement and are far behind Apple health in terms of accuracy and detection.
"LISTEN ! I have just gone to log my badminton club night and find to my horror that badminton is now missing from the list of activities!! The most popular racquet sport in the UK!!!! Are your developers completely stupid ? Every update you do makes this app worse! And still the most useful part of the app, the weight management feature, is missing If you restored this back to version 1 it would be far better than it is now Zero stars for utter and complete incompetence"
The last update removed the weight management feature. I lost 20 pounds using Samsung Health. Also the app does not seem to count my walking steps as well. Purchased a competitor's fitness tracker and using their app which syncs via GPS for accuracy.
"I've used this app for years(mostly just tracking miles on hikes/walks) and have enjoyed it. Today when I opened it, I had to agree to terms/services which were the app to make and manage phone calls. I've been using it for years without that, so why now??!! So I denied it twice and now I can't use the app. üñï samsung unless you can give me a GOOD reason why you need access to the phone."
"Good but could be much better! I use it to track my food but there is no space to put how much a serving size is. I wish it had a scanner for food package bar codes so that you just scan and log. Also I wish it had a women's health tracker, to track your period. Other than that, Inthink its greatüòÅ"
"Challenges are pointless due to people cheating, it's physically impossible to do more than 200k steps in just 2 days and Samsung hasn't done anything about it in years. Food intake is not intuitive as e.g. MyFitnessPal. Having alarm set early morning before usual wake up time as reminder to take medicine scores negatively and counts as if you didn't get enough sleep. Doesn't track indoor steps very accurately."
"Used to be a good app, but after updates they took away the ""watch only"" steps counter selection. Why in the world would I want to count both my watch and my phone together? If I walk 7000 steps and have both my watch on and my phone with me it doubles the steps and says I walked 14000 steps, worthless! It used to have it so you could choose ""watch only"", phone only"" or "" both"", bring the old version back! Makes having a $400 Samsung watch worthless."
"works mostly as intended, but i can't scan my glucose sensor (FreeStyle Libre 2) anymore, without having to open the FreeStyle App first, because the Health app for some reason wants to also scan the sensor (without actually being able to tho). which is incredibly annoying and inconvenient a toggle would be great to stop the Health app from attempting to scan the NFC chip inside the sensor. also the battery drain on Android 10 is insane"
"I've always loved this app but since the last update for me (7/6/2020) the app randomly closes, and does not want to store my sleep data from my Samsung active watch. It also doesnt seem to be tracking my total floors climbed anymore either. If these issues were fixed, it would be wonderful."
In order to access the challenges I now need to give Samsung access to my contacts. I purchased a Samsung watch last year to be able to monitor my steps and heart rate. The challenges were a fun bonus. I never had any intention of connecting to my friends as a apart of the challenges. Why do I need to now provide my contacts if I have no intention of connecting with them. This should be an optional permission if you want to connect with friends. There is no need for this information.
"Every update seems to be a little worse. Why can't we see the TOTAL amount of calories burned at a QUICK glance on the home page?? NOT daily activity &please bring back the automatic calorie intake/deficit counter based off how many calories we've consumed&burned. Prior: It WAS great, 5 stars, but the latest update got rid of my most used feature. PLEASE bring back the weight management features, that was the MAIN reason I used this app&inputted my food throughout the day."
I have always loved this app and thought it was great. However since the recent update litte or none of my steps are being counted . I would definitely do at least 15000 steps per day as I walk everywhere yet at the end of the day only a few hundred steps have been accounted for. I know it's not my phone that's the problem as I downloaded an other step count app and that's working fine in comparison. perhaps there is a glitch in the system. sorry dont mean to rant on just found this annoying
"love it. Along with Galaxy watch has got me thinking about my exercise and encouraged me to move a lot more. Wish I could add foods from Japanese manufacturers and supermarkets though as I live in Osaka and so it's difficult to keep track of diet/calories. Other than that, no complaints. Wish you could challenge random people to a 1v1 as I don't know anyone else using the app."
"Review as of 11/21/19: I'd rate it 2 1/2 stars. Issues with Samsung's Galaxy Watch Active 1) Doesn't track floors, or inclines while walking up and down hills which I have a lot of where I do my routine walks. (I believe the cut-off for the watch to record is 10 ft. Most homes are 8 ft per floor.) 2) HR count is wrong comparing the count under the Stress widget to simply counting HR alone. Difference of 4 or 5 beats. 3) Stress is ALWAYS zero regardless of what stress I am actually under 4) I hav"
"UPDATE! I found the app, it is the ""My BP Lab"" app that works with my watch, unfortunately it does not populate the blood pressure reading, I still have to do it manually. Otherwise I love this app. I especially like the challenges! Please consider a FAQ for the app so it is easier for beginners. I would give this app a 5 if it wasn't so confusing! I have updated my watch and phone but cannot find the blood pressure widget/app. There's not enough user instructions or hints in the app."
Great way to stay on track. This app has made it very easy to count calories and keep track of my progress. While using this app I was able to lose 50lbs so far just by recording my food and excercises. My doctor said not to do Keto or Paleo and that counting calories is the healthiest way to lose weight and with this app that becomes easier.
"The challenges are good and the data collected can be useful, but I hate that if you do any recorded exercise at all, even for 1 minute, it wipes out all the calories burned that were tracked through steps, so doesn't show you a proper balance for the day."
"They disabled the ability to split out step counts from your watch and phone. And force you to use both which basically double counts all your steps. A walk that would give me 2500 steps now shows as 4500 steps. So they've essentially bricked this software. Note10+ and Gear S3 watch, so completely unacceptable that they don't work right. Will be changing to Google Fit app"
"I used it for a couple of months on and off because with every update, new problems occurred. From not being able to access my account, to the app crashing, not syncing and now with the new required permissions... I will definitely uninstall it. I will go back to only using my fitnesspal."
"I use to love this app, however over time they have removed useful features and now with the latest update they claim they need access to my phone and contacta in order to use the app at all. I fail to see the logic behind this requirement as this app is being used to track my run times and distances. Reply to response: That is not an acceptable response. There is absolutely no need to have permission to make and receive phone calls or my contacts. Uninstalled."
"I never installed this app. Found it under the play store, slected to uninstall it and all of a sudden it was placed on my phone. I since disabled it but I DONT WANT IT. Google and Samsung, if I don't want something and I choose to take it off my phone, respect my choice and keep it off! The same thing happened to me with google photos and gmail. I have other apps that fill the need of the previously mentioned apps and the other apps that I have and like are still connected to these big names."
"So why the SPo2 removal? This was one of the biggest features I used, judging by the recent reviews a lot of other people used it as well. Bring it back. The solution Samsung is posting to reinstall or go into the Manage Items tab does not work, the independent SPo2 feature is gone. 5 stars if they bring it back and separate it from the useless stress sensor."
Have used this for a while now & love it. Allows me to choose what I want to monitor & I've noticed an improvement in health and sleep patterns. Would give 5 stars if had the ability to add my own exercise activities rather than being limited to Samsung's list. My exercise is more likely to be part of daily life like gardening or physical house work rather than organised sports or gym work. But I bet the 2 hours I spent cleaning windows is just as good for me as arm curls. Keep it up Samsung!
"Good for keeping track of what I'm eating, though there's a lot of food items missing. Also, the exercise tracking is garbage. Doesn't register when I run half the time, and I once was active for almost an entire day, with only breaks to eat and respond to messages and it said 17 minutes."
"I never realized just how much I walked until I started using this app!!! This amazing app even recognized when I was asleep. It has a calorie tracker and you can even schedule a doctor's appointment online. This is more than just an app or a program, this is an all encompassing experience that allows you to better understand your daily activity and to make a real change to your most valuable asset; your body!!!"
"Used to be useful but changes have made it hard to operate. One of the worst is the changing of the nutrient bar from a three colour scheme to all green, making it harder to differentiate between the fats, carbs and protiens. Also annoying is the way it places supermarket brands above general goods."
The app is telling me to eat 1000 calories less a day when I need it to be 500 but there is no longer any setting to change how many lb you wish to lose a week its just default to 1k even when I set calorie goal to 1875 it auto reverts back to 1375 the next day 100% useless now and its screwing up my galaxy watch active because of it. Why the hell would they remove the feature to let us set our calorie deficit??????
"I do like this app, made me more active. I love doing challenges. I like that I can gain level and see how much progress you have gotten over the time. But What I think is: why the MAX level is showed by rockets but every else is by wings? Would make sence to keep the same wing theme. Also would be nice if you could see samsung user by region and to set for challanges to compete with specific region (like Europe, Asia, USA ect.) P.S. A custom character by the step counter would be great! :3"
"I love this app, started using it last year but it froze and when I reinstalled it I could not retrieve my previous work out info despite registering. I uninstalled it for a while and reinstalled it this January. I am praying it doesn't freeze on me again. Love it and love the group step challenges."
"Nice app, paired with my galaxy watch I find it useful to keep track of my activities and calories throughout the day. The ability to add your food and manually enter nutrients is nice however it will only ask the ""calories per serving"". An option as ""calories for 100 gr"", or define the weight of a serving could be a nice addition. Hope this will be added in the future."
"Recent updates have made the 5x1 widget unable to be re-sized. With the small font it does not need to be 5x1, and wastes screen real estate. It was previously resizable, and now it isn't, which is a definite downgrade. I would rather use another app with better widgets."
"Its does exactly what I need it to do well, which is to flex on friends for having less steps than me. I cant comment on any of the features that need a wrist band thing cause I dont have one. I enjoy the monthly step challenges, wish there were more but you can make your own kinda. Edit: over a year later and I stand on my original review"
"Since the last update, the sleep information reported in the app is not complete. While my watch still gives the breakdown of how much in each sleep category, the app reports this as zeroes. Also, the use if daily average blood pressure instead of the last blood pressure reading should be a user choice."
"Samsung have finally got this app close to being good, and now (July 2020) they are intending to cut even more functionality in the app - so no more weight management, calorie tracking, weight logging or food & caffeine tracking amongst other things in v6.11, with this functionality also removed from Samsung watches. This in addition to already shelving the together function. Although this is not the best program in the world, it is integral to using a Samsung watch to track health, wellbeing & exercise since the Samsung watches will not interface to other health tracking apps. Killing these functions means that there is basically no point in having a Samsung watch to track activity and general health with Samsung. I can only assume Samsung are pulling out of this market - or the software and hardware teams are so separate they don't understand there is no point in buying a Samsung watch without the Health app having these functions given the watches are generally poor at tracking fitness activities anyway - I'm not sure why they are doing it given the upcoming launch of a new Galaxy Watch. it also does not interface to other health tracking apps very well - myfitnesspal sync does not work reliably, neither does Strava; and there is no interface to any Garmin devices to accurately track exercise such as cycling or running. It leads me to the conclusion that investment in Samsung health & watch apps are no longer viable, and that a shift to either Apple, Fitbit or Garmin now looks like the only route to go. Whatever you do, don't buy a new Samsung watch in order to use this health tracking app - it will no longer work usefully by the end of the month."
"WORST UPDATE EVER!! Weight Management GONE, Caffeine Tracker GONE, Sleep Tracker can't be adjusted (I spend most of day sitting in office) records this as sleeping and delete function to remove individual sleep times has been removed, Blood Oxygen is back, but only works with Gear 3 (don't have it, why bother), Colors way too much green, older eyes need contrast of different colors. TERRIBLE TERRIBLE TERRIBLE Update. Let's go back to last version and start again. Don't phone, JUST FIX IT!!"
"I used to love this app, but ever since the recent update got rid of my calorie intake vs burned its been so much harder to stay on track with my weight loss. This app just plainly sucks without it and isn't worth the storage space. I hope developers bring back that feature as many of us relied on it."
"I find this app motivating. Lately it feels like the length of time to reach the star goals has become shorter. If you don't get a few long walks in the first 3 days, you end up being behind the whole month. Would like to see a bit more time between them."
"I switched from a Fitbit to a galaxy watch and was very pleased to see I could still do challenges & stuff but S health makes it really hard to add friends & you can only challenge 1 person at a time which isn't any fun. also my steps definitely aren't accurate. 2,000 for the whole day when I'm on my feet all day. dont think so. One of the main reasons I switched to the galaxy watch is because of s health & so far I am not pleased. I hope to be able to change my review soon!"
"This app was working perfectly until a few days ago. It no longer syncs steps on my phone with my watch. Also , can no longer get the Monthly Global Challenge. It doesn't recognize me error 5505. Huge disappointment. *UPDATE* The issue has been resolved ! Thank you for reaching out ."
"This app is dogshit. The health App on the Galaxy watch 3 crashes after the first rep on several exercises, such as arm extensions and squats. I used to this app for 3 months with no problem. Then it started crashing. My workouts take twice as long if I rely on the watch. I paid full price for this watch, and I expect it to perform as advertised. [Response to developer: I already attempted to call. Nobody to answer.] [Update 2020.07.20 Still broken. Crashes 1 min into stretch. No phone support.]"
"I really enjoy the Samsung health app and how it connects easily with my Samsung active 2, my fitness pal and my renpho scales. This really helps give me a full insight into my eating and activity habits. I've taken off 2 stars as since the latest update, it no longer contains the weight management tile and I previously used this everyday to gauge whether I can up my macros or have to lower my food for the day based on my activities. Gutted its gone!"
"The latest update requires 2-factor authentication. I receive the code via an SMS but the app doesn't allow you to enter it. The ""verify"" button is greyed out constantly and so you can't log in and therefore cannot use the app. In addition, it now requires permission to make phone calls. There's absolutely no reason for this. Samsung ""assure"" us that this is needed for an optimal user experience, which is nonsense. App has now been uninstalled. Why did they have to ruin a perfectly good app?"
"Going from bad to worse again. The update 2 updates ago has caused the app to crash when I try to chage the date of an entry such as blood pressure. Please fix the Calendar feature when you want to enter data for a different date. The roller for time works, but the roller for date does not."
"Terribly disappointed. Only reason I used this ap was for weight management. What's the point of this now? Will not be using this ap any longer and will be returning my watch as soon as it arrives. Where was the research on this? Everyone I know loves this feature. It helped me lose 85lbs. Thanks for nothing, your developers can have my skinny clothes when they inevitably don't fit. üôÑ Update 10/3 now that this feature has been removed from my watch too, the number provided isn't working. Wow."
I like this app. The three things that I find wrong with it is that 1. sometimes that nutrition information is not the same as on package 2. needs to have a scanner that way you can just can the barcode instead of trying to find it by typing it in manually. 3. it needs a way of adding an activity that is fine not listed.
"Update privacy policy lockout. Can't use your app anymore. It tells me to allow permissions under settings but it doesn't say how. I've fiddled around with it, dwnld policy, click allow, etc. Nothing keeps telling me to change my settings. Complete stupid loop, again. Thanks techies, can't u think of something more constructive?"
Been working fine but this lst week its not recording any steps!
"Disappointed with sinchronization of sleep data from watches to application. Sometimes it works, sometimes not. Like weather. I wonder how can it be for such a reputable company! Before I had a phone and watches from a competition and that worked much much bettet, no issues with anything."
I install this app from time to time to back up my watch data but always end up chucking it out when it chews my battery. Why does it even bother when I have a Samsung watch to count activity? Anyway can't even do that now as it hasn't manged to log into my account for weeks. Hopeless. If Samsung want me to stay in their walled garden they could at least put some flowers in it... UPDATE 2/2/21. I changed to a new (to me) phone and logged in to Samsung Health in an instant after months of failure and loss of health data. Very mysterious. Updated to 3 star but still wasted a lot of time with this app. Odd thing was I never had a problem logging into the Samsung account in the Wear or Pay apps...
"When I first started using the app it was absolutely fine. Now nothing seems to work. Doesn't seem to track steps, used to automatically. When I start walking the app pauses for no reason and does record. I'm beginning to wonder if it has anything to do with the fact that I've just finished paying off my phone contact and it's a way of Samsung trying to get me to get another"
"Wish I'd had auto update turned off, like I thought I did, and had read reviews first. As others have stated, can no longer sync my steps and info with myfitnesspal since latest update. I hope this was a mistake that will quickly be remedied with a patch and not a permanent change. Very disappointing and frustrating."
"First off, the app works great and I love keeping track of my steps and measuring my caloric intake. However, this app crashed my phone almost three times a day. I finally uninstalled the app two weeks ago and I have had zero restarts since then. Once again the app is great but not with my phone."
"The step and period tracker are bang on, heart rate monitor is good too, but the sleep tracker needs work - deep sleep is never more than a few minutes and the time of the various sleep stages don't even add up to the total time slept. Most of the health features don't work in Canada. Also, huge invasion of privacy - access to my contacts is just an invitation to send spam to my contacts, but I had no choice other than to delete the app."
Cant seem to remove the ads at the top. Tried reinstalling through the galaxy store instead of google play store and same problem. Going to Settings > Privacy > Customisation Service and turning it off/opting out wont work either. Will keep a 1 star rating until this is removable since it is super annoying. The watch and phone were already expensive enough.S10+@UK Edit(A):yes there are but unfortunately I can't attach a screenshot in here. Anyways it seems there are other people complaining too
"The app is great but could be a little better. Samsung team needs to bring back some of the old features. Such as the heart rate, stress rate, and step meter being able to viewed from the main screen much better"
Please fix... since the last update it won't sync to any other fitness app. Myfitness says it's a Samsung health issue. Samsung health says it's a myfitness problem. I've talked to both. Plus the new update won't let me differentiate steps between my phone and my watch. So it's not accurate. If you fix this stuff I'll give you five stars. If not then I'll have to delete it.
"Until the recent update I was happy with this app. I don't use a samsung exercise tracker (eg watch), before the update I was able to manually input my exercise data from spin class, pilates and body pump. I can no longer do this and have to start the timer. This is not practical when in group classes."
"This app was great but as other users have mentioned yesterday's update (5.8.20) has removed some of the best functionality without any visible user benefits. In particular it has removed feature that tracks your daily calorie balance intake vs exercise activity, which was so useful for monitoring your daily progress and weight loss goals. Real shame you can't just roll back the update as am now left looking for other apps instead."
"I really enjoy this app but have noticed that I can't manually enter workouts anymore - it will allow me to input the info but when I click ""save"" nothing happens. Hard to use the weight management tool effectively if I can't accurately track calories burned during exercise."
Would be 5 stars if it synced to wearable devices like Fitbit. A lot of missed steps because I don't keep my phone on me at all times. It really interferes with being able to accurately keep up with where I stand.
Is there a way to go back to the previous version of the app? I don't like the way the activity history if shown now. I miss the graph that shows minutes of activity for every day. I almost uninstalled this app because the graph is gone Also i miss being able to enter my exercise data like elliptical trainer or exercise bike. I could just enter it before without starting the timer
"This is a great app for tracking everything you do, but I wish there was a way that we can track specific foods and their nutritional values. I'm currently overseas and I eat different things from different nations that aren't listed; I would love the option of manually entering the items myself."
Weight management feature removed 8/5/20 and it is the only feature that set it apart from all the others apps. This app has been on a steady down hill trajectory since 2018. I have to wonder if the developers actually use the app or just randomly remove content to justify their existence.
"This used to be pretty good, despite not allowing you to compare the number of calories burned against the number of calories eaten. However, it had an update a few days ago deleting the option to track morning and afternoon snacks into just one snack, and I'm the type of person that eats six meals a day. So this app has gone from sort of working with me to working against me. Update - 15 Mar 2021: I have returned to using another app for my diets. Only use this to track activities."
"I'm extremely disappointed at the fact Samsung has removed Stress, SPO2, and Heart Rate trackers, some of their more important features. I've been trying to find a way to get those back but haven't been successful. I for one will uninstall this program from my phone as it NO LONGER SERVES A PURPOSE! Samsung, what are you doing? You're taking steps back my dear friend! People need to reduce their stress and monitor their heart rates/spo2 levels and ya take this off now. SMH"
"A few weeks ago after the latest Galaxy Wear update this app stopped working...I called tech support several times but they were unable to resolve the issue even after I uninstalled it, force stopped it, reset my watch, reinstalled app, etc. Basically Samsung Health has been rendered useless & I'm ready to retire my watch...I will NOT purchase another Samsung watch. Samsung, thank you for your response but your suggestion didn't work either and I am still unable to turn on ""auto-detect workout"", it's ghosted. I am not interested in calling your Tech Support group again...due to a language issue I could hardly understand one tech and she would repeat whatever I just said to her, then the next tech sounded like she was washing her dishes the entire time while we were talking. I am shopping for another smartwatch now but it will NOT be a Samsung!"
"It sucks for counting your steps now, it was only counting about every fourth step I took so I didn't get a star for the monthly challenge but it sure does count 1 step as 100 for other people. The monthly challenges are annoying because they allow so many people to cheat. They should be able to tell that someone who gets 150,000 steps in a day is cheating. I'm no longer going to use this app."
"Works as intended I guess. I only use due to having a Samsung Galaxy Watch. However, I come from using Myfitnesspal which is astronomically better. Having the ability to measure your food in your choice of grams, ounces, etc is so much easier than being forced to use a specific measurement like in Samsung Health. Also the barcode scanning option in Myfitnesspal is argument enough to use it over Samsung Health. It makes adding foods so much faster and easier."
"I'm sure that I used to be able to log and change my exercises manually, but I believe the latest update removed that feature. This is a MUST HAVE feature. Please bring it back. I do Zumba in an overchlorinated pool, and want to log that manually. What do you expect people to do when their phone dies?"
"I used to enjoy this app but the updated one is no good for me coz the feature that I enjoyed the most is gone. I used to enjoy the stress monitoring feature where one's heart beat and oxygen level is measured and it gives you the update of your stress level but in the updated version, it's totally different"
"Love the app. Very helpful. I have a suggestion, if it doesn't exist and I was just unable to locate it. What about a function that allows to change the reset time for the steps? For people like me that live on a 3rd shift schedule. Just a thought. Awesome app."
"This app has so much potential, but there is no way to manually enter exercise data. You literally have to select an exercise and start a timer, and stop it when you've hit the time you need. So if I hiked for two hours without my phone, I would need to go home, select ""hiking"" on the app and let the timer go for two hours, then remember to stop it at the right time in order to make it accurate. If I forget to stop the timer, there is no way to edit the time. I have to delete and start the timer all over. Really freaking stupid. For this reason I have uninstalled."
"I was using Fitbit for years. I just started using Samsung Health again (there was quite a gap between uses) to see if it could track everything I need/want. A set back I am coming across is the ability to quickly and accurately add food to the log. This has been made more convenient by other application providers by being able to quickly pull information from the internet as well as being able to ""scan"" the food in using the UPC. Another useful portion would be the ability to enter information on a website or app on my computer for when I can not use my phone. I am now looking into wearable accessories to use so it can take into account the movements and activities I am doing throughout the day when I do not have my phone on me. Want to score higher, but the portions I want to use on this application (scanning, entering food, and website control) are not where I would expect it to be after years of this application being utilized."
The app is really useful and well designed. I find the measurement features very helpful. I was slightly disappointed that it now needs telephone permission before allowing access. I have been assured this is purely internal to the application and data will not be shared in any way so am upping my rating.
"Great app, and it ties together for all my samsung devices.  There are some 'wishes' though.  Ability to edit entries, export to a printer friendly format (glucose, BP history for physician visits).  It would be amazing to see a histogram tying exercise, calories eaten with the effects on BP, glucose, heartrate, etc.  it would drive home the impact of diet and exercise on overall health."
"Nice app but there some features that need to improve like Counting steps is not accurate , sleep calculator isn't too, and the most one is calories calculator because there are many missing food items , there are no Description for the food except thier title so you won't be sure if that is the same item in your mind as there are tons of recipes with the same name, the search for items are not easy you can search on ""tomato"" then most of leading result are titles with that word."
"The latest version update lacks most of what made this a great app. Macronutirents are only visible as percentages? How does this help millions on Keto / counting carbs? Trends are still crippled compared to the pre January release. Snacks can no longer be entered morning, afternoon and night - just one generic area to clump everything. If it was just buggy or broken, I would be disappointed. Unfortunately this near perfect app has had things removed making it a shadow of what it was."
"Can't set up app on my Samsung A70. My son has a Huawei Android device and it works for him. I tried to unibstall, clear the cache, and data still doesn't work. I need this app for my watch and it sucks it isn't working. It says this service is temporarily unavailable to try again later(0x0700010), but it doesn't work. I was able to access in the past but now I get an error. Please if you can let me know how to get this working again. Thank you"
"I have used this Samsung Health app for a long time and loved it to keep track of healthy lifestyle and fitness goals. However, the newest update has set the Daily Activity to a default number rather than my own on Activity Time, and it has gone back to all of the previous months and says that I have not hit my target, like only hitting it 1 out of 31 days -- when in fact, I have been hitting my daily targets 5 or 6 out of 7 days per week. How do I fix this? It is a good app, but this new update has messed up my own records. I have changed the ""Set Target"" on the Daily Activity to my own numbers, not the default. But it still has not corrected my records for the past many months. This is an update that has made the app worse, in my view. Please let me know if there is a way to reset my past months' Activity records so that they are correct with my set targets. Thank you."
"Was a great app until it wouldn't work unless I changed my permissions to give it access to my contacts and photos. I deleted it instead. There is no justification for this requirement! Your flimsy excuse for requiring access is just that. It never needed it before, so it should not need it now. My information has been sold to enough scammers!"
"App itself is fine, but the issue is the last major update which Gear Sport had. issues: - Even after Do Not Disturb: On, the wrist movement wakes the screen - Battery life has went down from well over two days to well under two days - After walking like for 20-25 mins, previously the ""walking activity"" would show distance traveled as 1-1.25 miles which is correct, but now it shows, 0.05-0.25 miles for the same route - Sleep activity notification which used to come on watch isn't coming anymore"
You cannot truly track your health if you cannot track your daily intake. It is not even an option to customize the food. Not everything consumed is purchased but only purcased items are t he choice. This app has a swrious flaw. Even from the list of items the right choices can be selected from list of food and beverages either.
"I walk about 1.88 miles every morning, but the app randomly plants a finish line flag and stops my workout timer without me doing anything. It is very frustrating because I track my meals on this app as well. I guess I'll have to get another step counting app. Great phone. Bad app."
"Used the app for 20 mins and realised that ""Step Tracking"" can be easily manipulated, just by shaking the phone back and forth. I was sitting and shaking the phone when my step count increased from 0 to 75 in under a minute. Is there any fix for this? Otherwise the app is good."
The latest update has rendered this app useless for me and many others. The weight management data has been removed for no reason. This was the primary use to see how I was doing against my calorie target. I know Samsung are commenting to phone them and explain the problem but what is the point? Just put the weight management calorie target info back. This does not need a phone call to discuss. Looks like you will lose a galaxy watch user. Time to go back to my fitbit if this is not resolved
"I use this app all the time. Samsung Galaxy had an update that installed last night. I went hiking today. I always use this app to map the distance of my hike. Saturdays I go for over 22 miles and every week I go further than the week before. I was looking to hit 22.75 miles today. After going about 3.25 miles I checked the app and it showed that I had only gone 0.25 miles. After another 1.5 miles, the app only advanced to a total of 0.9 miles. I ended the session and started it again, but not"
"I will not give a health tracking app permissions to my phone directly or contacts. The together was never a feature I used, I have no need to share my data with anyone beyond my wife. Maybe connect that to a social media thing or let it be opt in. On top of that since denying those accesses it seems to be killing the watch battery in hours instead of days. Removing the app, might check back in a few weeks if I do not find something less intrusive first."
"13 months ago I wrote a 5-star review of Samsung health that has now reduced to one star and I wish it could be less than that. I just lost three years of data on exercise and nutrition, an app that had become a daily companion to help me improve my health. I have severe food allergies and it was just such a blessing to have this app. But all of a sudden in the middle of the day this past week everything changed. The app went down and required privacy permissions I couldn't give."
"Since updating the app, it doesn't pick up exercises from the Samsung Gear Fit 2 watch, only picks up walking exercises. I have the latest versions of both apps installed and I have forced stop and cleared cache and it does not work. Your app support also does not work, no one responds"
I loved using this app and have for years and up to a few days ago I would have gave it 5 stars however all of a sudden it stopped tracking my steps. I emailed the developer about the problem a d got no response. Tried to update the app and still did not work. Uninstalled and reinstalled it. Still nothing works and I lost all my history.
Trash app. Won't clear notifications. Won't sync with my phone. Tracks everything. Deleting it ASAP. I appreciate the effort to correct any issue I only wanted the pedometer and it's not essential to my work so I probably would delete the app no matter what
"I recently opened the app to use it and I'm logged out. So I had to accept terms, then set up a two step verification, but as soon as I do, I get sent back to the previous screen. So, I've tried multiple solutions but am unable to get passed it and log in. So the app is now useless unless I can get this fixed."
"Like the person before me, the sensor stopped working to get heartbeat and oxygen. I uninstalled the app and reinstalled to see if that would fix the issue. Now it looks like I lost all my history AND the option to measure these things. I liked the app...this is very disappointing."
"Get back to basics, first experience with gear 3 and workout started on the app is auto pause triggering, stats not accumulatings, etc. Many clicks to get it working and figuring out what's going on. You can't get a good first experience going, and you're just another data mining app"
"Randomly adds thousands of calories to my workout in combination with Samsung galaxy watch. Today I burned 9000 kcal after a 1 hour cycling trip, rediculous. Support contacted but do not provide a solution. Deep sleep tracking inaccurate. People, including myself report getting 20 minutes per night while it should be hours. 3 day delay on sync with Strava. Any nice features of this app and combo with watch are useless if the basic features do not work. Sad,as I really liked the promised features"
"I used to love this app and I was very happy using it and recommending, prefering it over the others apps I have tried before as Garmim Connect, MyFitness Pal... But now I am very frustrated since the new update. I can not believe that Weight Management was removed. It was the best function in Samsung Health and now I can not see any advantage in using the app. I can see that many users are frustrated too... I hope for a new update that includes this function again."
"Using with the Galaxy Active Watch. Pretty good so far, however it seems to be doubling my activity when i sync with the mapmyrun application. For example it shows that i ran 5 miles on the Samsung health app in the 'exercise' section but in the 'active time' section it will have twice as much time and 10miles..."
"I just bought a note 10 and the samsung health app on my phone isn't automatically tracking sleep like it did on my note 8. Most nights the last thing I do before I go to sleep is put my phone down, so this feature was very helpful...now I can't figure out how to re-activate it. I think I am logged into my samsung account (but to be honest that is difficult to tell too from the app...there isn't a clear ""account"" designation/button, do who knows."
"I do not wish to give permission for the app to make and manage calls. I miss the calorie tracker option on the watch.. I also miss the feature on the watch that let me view past workouts without accessing the app on my phone. I will not be using this app until they change the permission requests. If granting permission is not intended for monitoring call history, than I see no reason why this permission is needed. I'll be using Map my Run or Run Keeper from now on."
Wish I would have bought another Fitbit. The Fitbit app is much better for health tracking. I go up and down stairs MANY times a day and this Active 2 and app rarely register any. It's been this way ever since I bought this watch a little over a year ago. The sleep tracking doesn't seem very accurate either. Since the last update it says I've had ZERO deep sleep. I like the watch for messaging and such but the health tracking part needs MUCH work.
"Since the last update, the Daily Activity has been showing no data. My steps appear in the Step Count. I've tried clearing the Cache, Restarting the device & App and even Resetting the data. The app is being updated and primmed for the latest Samsung Galaxy watches which is having a negative affect on the Samsung Galaxy Fit 2 (which I own)"
"The App all of a sudden is not responsive to my movements. It records far less than my actual movements. Also, during workouts, it automatically pauses even when I am walking or running, and so I have to manually restart the session which is very distracting during workout sessions."
"The front page is like IOS widgets, gross. Why are they only in one column? I want to see everything, at least basic info, without scrolling. Later at the demand, this scrolling thing should appear, but now, this is not very conventional. I don't know who designed this, but it's not good. Background is also very unfinished, just white color. Place there something, or show blurry photos which I added to workouts. You know before I bought galaxy watch, there was advertisement for them."
This app feels very incomplete next to Fitbit. It does a very poor job tracking stairs and elevation. The food tracking doesn't list serving sizes and doesn't let you enter arbitrary calories. The sleep tracking is very inaccurate and often fails to record sleep after a short break in cycle - like to use the bathroom. I could go on but I think I've made my point.
"All this program is, is a diary, you have to record everything yourself.. This program has become obsolete..why keep a program when you can sell separate devices for every single action the program used to do..even the step counter is worthless now..I'd rather buy 2 cans attached to a long string at each end than buy samsung phones any longer..but somehow I think Samsung would lead the industry in can phone sales.."
"The weight screen is not working properly. I record my weight and it doesn't show up in the graft until later that day. It shows yesterdays info but not the new weight I entered until later in the day, like the time is off yet I went into the app and synced it and still not updating."
"I used to be a sumsung girl and as much as I love my gold rose Galaxy watch, it's a beauty, I realized that it's measurements don't work correctly eg walk steps, GPS function, calories burned and many others. I installed the map my run app which is more close to my friends results who are using Garmin wearable and applications. I'm always 500m behind in walking mode and it shows that I burn twice calories üôÑ Also there is no point to call abroad for fixing this. You need to make much more work."
"Would like to edit some of my workout data. Eg if you get in your car after the gym with it still auto running it will think your jogging, and then you can't delete that section of recorded data... be handy to actually be able to edit post recorded data, add in your pauses change of apparatus or if you ended earlier then it thinks."
"Honestly love the app... my only problem would be the walking/ counting my steps... it randomly stops working, i've cleared the data/cache as well as uninstall and re-installed the app and it doesn't seem to work like it use too... slightly upsetting. Would be nice if this could be fixed x"
"Only started using recently since I bought a galaxy watch. Almost all my stats are inaccurate on a daily basis. I wake up in the morning, add 250 calories for breakfast snack and it says I'm 1200 calories over my daily limit. Also does not update on my watches main icons. I need to open the app to see up to date info that's still wrong half the time. That along with the no 3rd party texting app support on my watch means I'll have to return this galaxy watch."
"I used this app for years and was satisfied. I tried to use it yesterday for my run and it would not load without me giving it access to my phone? I was annoyed and wanted to use it so after failed attempts to bypass the phone permission I granted it access. Then it insisted i set up two factor authentication and It wanted my phone number. Deleted, I'll search for another app that will log my runs."
"Like many others noted the new Version is simply terrible. It WAS a good app, but it is kot anymore. I loved the feature with accumulated data for weeks an months, why on earth was it removed?? It was the whole point of the app. Also no way to check average burned calories. It's nice to know what i burned each day, but without any info on what i burned on average how is it useful? I don't care about how many minutes i was active on average, but the calories and I am obviously not the only one."
"Can't believe they took away the calories burned tracking and caffeine tracking. Should be improving the good features they already had not taking away popular ones. I bought a Samsung watch because it syncs with SHealth and my phone but I'll be looking elsewhere for a new health app now, which makes the watch almost worthless. This app is essentially just a step counter with a mediocre food tracker now."
"I really like the app, unfortunately for the last 2 days the steps that the app was recording for me didn't save so it looks as though I haven't done any walking. It was working fine so not sure why it's stopped saving them. Thank you for your suggestions, it's restored my steps I thought I'd lost. :)"
My husband and I loved using this app before the update. The weight management feature helped me to loose weight and I was just starting to see a difference! I was extremely disappointed this morning when I woke up to see that it was gone. It was the most helpful part of the app! Please bring back the weight management!
"After a recent update the sleep bar chart (which was very easy to read) has been replaced by a horrible squiggly line sort of chart which is almost impossible to understand. If it's not broken, why change something like that. Please reinstate the Bar Chart."
"The app seems to work well. However, I believe the dev should provide further detailed information why they need access to contacts, photos, and phone. Please don't give a canned non detailed response. State exactly why you need access to certain permissions that have nothing to do with the app's functionality."
"Overall it's a nice app, with two major disadvantages. 1. Must be able to remove nfc control. It blocks other apps actually using nfc. 2. For swimming, would be nice to add a swimming plan, for training, and seeing it on samsung watch while swimming."
I use the app daily to track steps and distance walked. It works well for this and is quite accurate. I do miss the ability to measure oxygen saturation though and find it disappointing that upgrades to an app would remove useful features.
"Doesn't open. Message says ""Won't work on a rooted phone"" but my phone isn't rooted or modified. It worked for weeks and suddenly quit for no reason.  EDIT - I called Samsung as requested below. They answered, said they didn't have an answer and ""escalated"" the issue. That was about 3 weeks ago so it would appear that they don't want to, or cannot, resolve this issue."
This was great until they removed the weight management feature. It helped me lose a lot of weight and conviced me to invest in a Samsung watch. I'm really disappointed that Samsung are hitting features from the app. Hopefully it returns.
The app is good for the most part. It's fairly easy to use but my main complaint is it doesn't allow me to input meals for the future. It's hard to track calories & proteins if im only able to track what I've already eaten
Wish there was a way to sync my Fb and ph contacts so I could connect with friends that have Samsung bands. Not sure if the band is accurately calculating my steps. I doesn't stay connected to my phone. I like the detaled food tracking and sleep info. But I'm considering going back to Fitbit brand. Not as user friendly as I had hoped for. PLEASE get rid of the advertising!!!
"I like this app, but after this last update, I can't swipe away the notifications. Specifically the steps counter. I do not want to totally disable the notifications. Please fix this!!! I do not like having a notification pop up every 5 to 10 minutes about my steps and other things. I like using this to see how many steps I take each day, but without all of the annoying notifications that I cannot swipe away. I don't mind them as long as I can do that and keep them silent."
"Recently updated and wants to do the two step verification. Tried to do it but when I type in the texted code it won't let me press enter. Can't use the app without entering through the verification process. Might just switch back to Google Fit, it connects with other apps unlike Samsung Health."
"One of the main reasons to purchase my current Samsung phone is the oxygen sensor and heart rate measuring facility through Samsung health app. Now after the last update, I'm not able to activate the app .. too much verifications and finally it is a closed loop cycle. Unfortunately, I disabled the app and thinking seriously to change my phone."
"Worked great for the first 2 days! The oxygen meter was never correct but it counted all my steps. Now it is not recording steps. We walked a mile, it said we took 114 steps so I might delete. I love the food tracker. It makes it so easy to keep track of calories because you enter a food item and a drop down menu pops up with all the different choices for what you ate then adds the nutrition facts for you. Starbucks, pb&j sandwich, tea w/milk & sugar and Little Ceasar pizza are examples"
"More interactive experience with other Samsung Health users would be great...sharing workouts and activities other that step counts. Adding friends and seeing their workout data, activity challenges such as exercise time, calories etc. Having the options of using the heart icon from samsung watch app to display on the mobile app. Just more interactive functions with Samsung health users needed would make the app great."
"I really enjoy parts of the app and it has great potential, but there are significant issues. PROS: - Integration with my Galaxy Watch works well, with very few issues - LOVE the workout programs, it's like having a personal trainer coaching me CONS: - Calorie tracking algorithm needs work, calories and steps sometimes vary inexplicably between watch & app post-sync - Weight Management function is TERRIBLE. Please let us set our own calorie/macro-nutrient intake & expenditure goals"
"If was a great app, but there is absolutely no reason for the Health app to have access to my contacts and phone. It would be really great if you stop demanding access to my private info so I don't need to look for another application. UPD: I've already read this standard ""answer"" to others comments, and it is absolutely not convincing. This app has nothing to do in my contacts. UPD2. Nothing changed. Uninstalling."
It WAS an all integrated health app but now they've removed weight loss tracking. Massive fail. I used to use this app for everything. I used to think of it as motivational. Now it's just frustrating. So disappointing I spent money on smart scales that were compatible with this app.
"Like numerous other users I do not want this app to be able to make and receive phone calls. The Samsung official reply that they aren't using this for anything but essential running of the app is not reassuring. A health app that 'needs' to be able to make or receive phone calls, is so far out of bounds it is terrifying! ETA: I have just noticed that *the only* required permission is telephone access; integral patrs of a health app such as tracking physical activities is only optional!"
Really disappointing Samsung that you removed the Weight Management facility. It's extremely useful and the logic removing it with your recent app update simply doesn't add up! Whomever made that decision needs to have a stern word with themselves and get it back urgently! Looking forward to Samsung resolving this quickly to what was an excellent health app Thank-you.
"If you updated and it is not working, clear cache and storage for the app. It will recover most of the data from the cloud. The new visual is more polished, and it works. But please, Samsung, try not to mess the updates next time."
"I'm so pissed right now! This used to be a fantastic app and I used it every day, but the latest update now requires you to have a Samsung account to even use the app - presumably to track your data. I used to have a Samsung amount but the constant notifications/account pings (that I couldn't turn off), demands for more permissions and info resulted in my deleting it. I will find another app to use. I've uninstalled this app & installed free oximetry & pedometer apps. No accounts required."
"It's very nice application overall. Its keeping you on track. Its encouraging you and your friend for walking competition. Only one negative point in weight management section, Mi Scale is in the list but not possible to pair it. If samsung rectify this will be perfect."
I like the different options for recording different things related to fitness. However I would like to be able to add in manually exercises done. I don't usually have my phone with me when I exercise so it doesn't get recorded and I can't add it later.
Good app over all but needs improvement. Let us log our calories for our own meals easier...we should just be able to input calories consumed if we don't want to list meal items specifically..also major improvement needed for monthly competition... more than 5 friends would be great... lastly calories burned during excerise seems very low when paired with samsung watch.....
"I wish I knew there were damn adverts in the app before buying the watch. I got the watch and connected it all up and now I have to look at adverts... Samsung you can jog on mate. Just like me with this watch, it's not bad. Edit: They replied saying there aren't ads... I'm looking at the damn things lol. So I'm changing this from 2 to 1 star. It even has a warning on the top of this app from Google that it contains ads. When I go to the app settings and select find in Play Store, it's this"
*Did as recommended and it seems to work fine. Thank you! Since last update the app keeps crashing. Cannot record food intake as after selecting anything screen frozes. After closing the app and opening again it still doesn't work.
This is a great app to help keep track of your fitness goals. If you are not that interested in exercise or fitness you can just monitor your health such as sleep. Moreover there is challenges you can join all year long for your competitive edge. Overall I truly enjoy using this app thank you ya.
"Workout on galaxy active dont count rep correctly You cant control the auto sleep mode / desactive it on the watch, wich start a sleeping session randomly when i'm gaming late and clearly still active You cant set food intake routine, have to enter everything manually (you can save frequently ate food/meal but still have to enter the 3 meals/3 snack each day ! Putting your watch on the charger also detect you are sleeping auto Nice app because its the only one compatible..."
"After mountains of negative feedback, there's been no fix to issues breaking this app. It looks a lot like this is a case of planned obsolescence, which is expected from you at this point. I'll just start looking for a different app that actually does what it's supposed to do, and never buy Samsung products again."
"Overall I like the app. I would like to have more achievements available for hitting consistent step goals, fastest run, doubling your step goal, etc. I would also like the share screen to show the exact workout time and not rounding it off to minutes alone."
"As far as I'm concerned an ""optimal"" experience does not include giving Samsung access to my phone and contacts regardless of what the obnoxious Samsung marketing replies tell you. They had to have known there would be a major backslash, which means they still think the revenue they anticipate from the new ""upgrade"" will make up for the subscriber loss. No thanks, I deleted the app."
"Please bring back the feature to pause tracking steps from your phone. My app is tracking twice as many steps because I cannot select just my watch. I've read hundreds of forum posts from people asking for this to be brought back. I'm fairly upset that I bought such an expensive watch, yet such a simple feature is missing"
"** wish I could contact you via the app. But I can't get past the agree to the privacy terms without being sent into ""session expired"" purgatory. Since the upgrade am caught in a loop where I can't log into the app as my session has expired but when when I try to log back in I get the same expired session message. Arghhh"
"It used to be the best health app back in 2017 when I would have rated it a 5. However, it feels like this app is deliberately being sabotaged with awful alterations like a terrible heart-shaped icon with no way of analyzing your activities instead of the previously articulate graph. There is also the hilarious mistake of grossly overestimating calories consumed sometimes more than 6 to 8 times what it should be."
"It tracks a lot of things, it can encourage others to take challenges but it doesn't really have an option to change it to pregnancy mode so I stopped using it a lot. I think working out is important but if I can't track it, it's hard to keep using an app."
"Response to Samsung's reply. I could transfer/backup data a whole lot safer and more private to my SD card rather than into Samsung's cloud, if the app was designed properly. App used to work, however now, unless you create a Samsung account so they can keep an eye on what your health is like, (not that I am in poor health or on any medications in my threescore+ years) and your usage of the app, it won't work. Unless you create an account you got nothing. Only the stepcounting widget will work."
"The app is good but it's no longer letting me use it on my phone (still using on my galaxy watch though). It keeps saying it can't be open on a rooted phone, I've tried all sorts of online recommendations but only works to open the app once. please help as I have used the app for years and has helped me with weight loss in the past."
"I really live this app very much since it is very helpful for me to lose my weight and track my calorie intake. I can set my goals using this app and it is very easy to track my calorie lost every time I did workout through this app, but somehow Samsung decided to remove the weight management was a very huge mistake. To short, everything was done in this app solely. It is a huge disappoinment. Please Samsung bring it back, I want back as it used to be."
"Worst experience with an app ever. I can't understand how the app can't remember my account for more than a week. Then when i try to log in again, it displays that my password is wrong. So i change it and try again and get the same problem. Really the worst user experience. I am considering of selling my galaxy active 2 watch only because of the incompetence of this app."
"Inaccurate distances. I walked the same route 2 days in a row. First day was 2 miles, second day was 1.75. Third day, I added an extra block & it came up 1.89. I get that every watch might measure differently but the same person with the same equipment on the same route gets significantly different readings."
"I despise how quickly some users ""finish"" the challenges. I know it's only cheating yourself, but for those who are actually trying their hardest and would like to see where they level up, it's very discouraging. Other than that, I absolutely love the app. It's great motivation for me, I don't have to pay a personal trainer to boot me in the bum, and it tracks everything I find neccessary, paired with my watch. Why does my step counter differ from my watch to the app???"
"I love Samsung and their phones, but I'm very disappointed that you cannot have a connected device (ie Garmin watch) sync data with Samsung Health outside of a Samsung device. They're treading into Apple territory with proprietary functionality. Don't regress Samsung! I've already made a personal ban of Apple products for this exact reason. You're better than this Samsung. Please open the ability to sync from any device, not just your own!"
"I was enjoying this app, mainly as a pedometer, but recent privacy changes and I can't use it. I've followed all the instructions, but resetting passwords etc and nothing ever moves on! I just can't waste any more time on it so about to replace with a pedometer app. Shame."
"Used this app daily but no more. Can't open the app since the last update without giving the and permission to make and manage phone calls. I won't do that regardless of Samsung's assurance it won't be misused or compromised. The ""enhanced features"" or benefits they claim don't outweigh my privacy or control of my data. Moving on."
"logging cycling workouts doesn't work on my Samsung Note 8. while the regular function tracks steps fine, it also tracks cycling as steps, and when using the cycling log it recorded no distance or speed, but continued living my motion as steps. I've used several apps for this in the last 8 years Ann's only one other had this issue."
"A week ago I would have given this app 5 stars, but over the last few days as I've set it before going on a walk, it pauses automatically for no apparent reason and the distance tracking has gone crazy... I'm extremely disappointed, I've been using this app for years!"
Latest update removed option to view weight chart by month. Only the daily chart is available now. Makes it harder to see weight trends over time. I don't really care if my weight fluctuates one or two pounds over a few days. It's more useful to chart weight gain or losses over a six month period.
Was a great app until they started removing functions. I have asthma and used the O2 saturation and tracking feature until its removal. The saturation is there but you cant track your results which is important when in the mountains or when sick. Bring it back and I'll bring back the rating.
Why can't you view weight by weeks or months anymore? Going day to day is all over the place. The sleeping times are messed up too. It tells me my average bedtime is 10pm and wake up time is 1030am. But if I look by day I wake up at 530am. Best thing I found was to go back several versions. Doesn't look as pretty but it does work better.
"So I've been using this App for years work just great. Had it in my last phone Galaxy Note 9 got broken and I got a New Galaxy 20 Ultra....When I went to set up the App it was easy. But when to use the Heart and Stress feature they took out the record on those,Now it looks like they froce you to use the watch with it. All this is just business moves,THEY ALL WIN,we keep losing üôàüôâüôä"
"Update May 2021.The developer contact email is NO REPLY. All of the sudden, you must agree to several permissions inc GPS, CALLS, STORAGE, CAMERA, CONTACTS just to open this app. Doesn't say WHY. If you deny permission it won't open. I've used the app for years but now I will find another app. It is ridiculous to need such permissions for a health app and for them to NOT BE OPTIONAL or include an explanation. You should still be able to use the other features without giving it these permissions."
I love this app been using it for over 2 years now and it was great at tracking my steps on my phone. I now have a Samsung gear watch that pairs with the app. There is so much you can track on it and you can choose how much or little you want to track. There is also fitness routines that record on the app and it all works at telling you how active you have been throughout the day. I also love the global challenge as it pushes me to complete it and you can also challenge other friends and uses.
Is there a way to adjust the steps? This app does not count step correctly. I walked to the bank and turned around and walked back. Exact same route. The tracker showed .77 miles going and .54 miles back. The distance is actually 1.2 miles each way. The number of steps wasn't even close.
"Is it just me? I have had a brand new note ultra and the new galaxy watch 3 since release and this app constantly crashes , I have uninstall, re install , phone and watch many times and it still crashes Wow. What amazes me more is this is the only app that crashes and this should be at the top of Samsung list to have correct. As I have come over from apple and I am mostly impressed , however this is unforgivable, its not good."
"Update: I've been using Samsung Health for a week or more since my last review and must change my last rating from 2 stars to 4. Maybe there was something I was doing wrong but it definitely deserves 4 stars. Easy to use and accurate. A very good exercise app. - ORIGINAL UPDATE--Since the last update, this app has gone from very good to very bad. The advertising gets in the way of the app, and the app continues to run even after you shut it down. Does Samsung really need the advertising $$$."
"Although my cellphone has Spo2 sensor, it doesnt support this function in the app. My device model is samsung galaxy S9 Plus."
"I very much agree with all the comments about Samsung overreaching tactics. The app has worked well without these numerous consents; why the sudden demand for them and Samsung""s ability to manage phone calls. None of the responses provided has addressed the need for the information, especially the fact that the app has always worked without these world of consents. I have been using Samsung several years. I wanted to replace my phone and get one for my son; but Samsung is dropping off my list."
"Quite average performance. Same distance shows different step count and distance when you walk and different when you run. Sometimes it goes off and just stops counting in the middle of running. Records cycling as ""walking"". I use it since covid restrictions but am aware its not fully reliable"
For the most part a good app. It has helped me make sure to keep within my daily balance of calorie intake vs activity. I started using it after having lost about 80 pounds and have lost another 60 pounds since starting to use it. It's a really helpful tool for me.
"As everyone else has said, the latest update has made it unuseable. You took away the most important part - weight management. I rely on this and now feel your app is a shell of what it was. To make it worse i recently invested in one of your watches to help track my steps and now feel I've wasted my money. My partner and I will be transitioning to my fitness pal or something else but unfortunately my watch is still useless as it doenst sync. Make the latest update reversable. Very upsetting."
"This app is poor compared to fitbit and MyFitnessPal. it's a shame because I want to buy a Samsung watch, but this app is stopping me. It measures liquids in grams, it shows different calorie values to myfitnesspal, it doesn't display any of the data nicely, it hasn't tracked my sleep for the last 2 nights despite me wearing the watch all night (testing using my partners samsung watch). I don't have anything good to say about it. It feels like a massive downgrade from fitbit, I expected better!"
I used to love it but after the last update it is asking a lot of permissions for example camera and use phone to make calls. I know you want to confirm the number and use camera for Samsung Health Together but in my case I do not used that feature and I did not give permission and as a result I was not able to pass the agreement page.
"Have used this app to monitor my step count and estimate my energy usage since switching to Samsung mobile. Has everything I've ever needed to record my activities, good information on calorie intake, water consumption, etc. Recently added the Fit2 Pro fitness watch which works flawlessly with Samsung health, with the added benefit of periodically and automatically checking my heart rate plus more, I can now get more in-depth data on my fitness activities."
Works with chest strap for heart rate monitoring during activities if the optical variety (like in a watch) is giving you troubles. It's not overly intuitive on hooking it up but Google is your friend there. It would be nice to select and see confirmation of what device the app is using to read heart rate.
I am a user of this application since 2018 and it is great and efficient. But I have an issue with the auto detect the workout : - Cannot detect the walking and the running even though the button is enable. I am using the latest version of the application and I am using a note8 Samsung Any suggestions would be great Thank you
This app does everything you need from logging calories and water intake to suggestions for exercising. Very useful. Have noticed that the app doesn't sync with Fitbit - there is about 7000 difference between the step count. Can this be rectified??
"I just switched back to Samsung health from the fitbit after some troubles I was having. I am sorely sorely disappointed that the weight management was removed from the app. This is so very NOT helpful! Why remove a feature that obviously was VERY important to Samsung customers/users?! I use this to track my weight and caloric intakes to better my physical health. PLEASE BRING BACK WEIGHT MANAGEMENT! There were no issues with the app or its use, why pull it!?!"
"I just recently changed my phone from a Samsung S7edge to an S9. I used to have very accurate step count as I use 3 different trackers but now it is so inaccurate! This has made me loose interest in taking part in the monthly challenges where I was able to reach set goals. I still meet my targets on the other platforms which give the same results only Samsung health gives a completely different result with almost 5,000step count difference/loss every day. Is there a solution to this problem?"
"unfortunately S health is just not at the level that FitBit is. For example I can't enter the exact amount of water intake, S health does it by glass (which is 8.4 Fl Oz). it's not easy to find food items commonly bought in stores via scanning the bar code (S health doesn't have the ability to scan bar codes) I can't see what time/s I was actually in REM sleep versus deep sleep (was I in REM at 2am?). I love being able to track everything, I just wish it was as user friendly as the fitbit app."
"I like this app, but it's connectivity to my Gear Active 2 is disappointing. I do a lot of kayaking and it's upsetting that there is no kayaking option for the watch to track. There's a phone workout for it, but this won't track my heart rate and other telemetry."
"Not reporting to other software programs I use my Samsung Note 9 and Galaxy Watch along with Samsung Health to track my daily steps. I sync the data to the 'Always On' app for my health care provider. Every since August 31st, Samsung Health has not synced or updated to my Always on app. All other software still syncs to Always on and coworkers that use IPhone products are still syncing with Always on. Samsung, I am not the only person having this issue, read others reviews and fix your app!"
"Ever since the update I can't get passed the verification page. Also, I don't like the idea that it forces you to give access to my contacts. I don't want my contacts to challenge me. A lot of my contacts are customers from our business. So, I just uninstalled the app. This is exactly what it says on the verification page: ""Samsung Health uses your phone number to help friends find you and invite you to challenges."""
"Good features that keep me coming back to look at my progress. Interactive activities that help motivate me and put my diet and activity into easy to understand graphs. ** REQUESTS: A way to add other custom activities, such as skateboarding, Olympic weightlifting, boxing (that records speed of the wrist during the lifts?) or a way to set variables like record elevation, hand/wrist movement, etc. Option to set Heart rate continuous/10 min/manual through the app and/or watch quick settings"
"I bought a watch to track my steps, heart rate, and o2 when I was diagnosed I had a bad heart condition. Every year it seems like this app gets rid of an average person's ability to track things like o2 testing and monthly heart rate averaged and goes more in depth for the avid sport playing, gym going, exercise machine. I'm very disappointed. AT least the step tracker is accurate, works well and I can see averages by month or year."
"I don't want target steps and heart rate on my widget. At least give the option to just have steps counted. Why not add a second option rather than removing the existing? Samsung is about full control and personalization... well it was, once. No point sending a developer number. I'm outside US."
"I hate the latest update that deleted a bunch of functionality, like being able to see weight changes by week, month, and year rather than just day to day. Plus, the app keeps crashing which is super annoying. Please fix immediately. Plus, I just looked through the latest awful reviews on the new update, and Samsung's response is to ask us to call them to discuss ""our"" issues. No! I will not spend all of my valuable time calling you to get you to fix the stuff you messed up. Just fix it!"
"I love S Health, I do. But you removed Fitbit integration, or any wearable integration for that matter, and that annoys me because isn't the point of having those wearables syncing to S Health is for better and more accurate data tracking for my health? I've always liked how Samsung place nice to third party apps and such unlike Apple but this new update bums me out because I don't want to transfer out of S Health because I like the features"
"Good to track multiple things such as steps, exercise, calories, weight, etc. I wished the food tracker could scan bar codes like other apps to find the nutritional content. It would also be cool if it tracked macros such as net carbs and sugars. However it's really nice for a free ap."
"The food tracker is not really user friendly. Once you record a meal you can't add to it. It would be helpful to have a barcode scanner for food items like other food trackers. also can the measurements be cup, tablespoon, each, etc. would be way easier to figure out then Grams."
I had this on my last phone and it worked great. It won't even open on my new phone. Have tried uninstalling and installing it again but nothing. It says: Can't set up the app. This service is temporarily unavailable. Try again later. (0x07...). What am I missing? I've had this phone for months!
"I seem to agree with most of the issues regarding the new update so I'll skip those issues. There are 2 main issues with the app that I want to address: 1) under the sleep heading there should be an additional area where naps can be recorded, after all we are trying to document our total time sleeping within a 24 hour period; and 2) in the ""Community"" section where you can ""nudge"" a friend, this latest update took away the option of a custom message. This area is where we are suppose to send encouragement, yet the pre-determined messages are not very encouraging! If we can't make our own encouraging messages then you need messages like ""Come on, you need to step it up! You can do it if you try."" Or ""You are falling behind, are you trying to let me win? You better step it up."" You need to offer encouragement."
"Great app BUT update has lost ability to average the heart rate counts for weekly stats resulting in showing only the first reading of the week as the weekly summary and one reading on the graph for that week, rather than the very useful cluster which has been the practice. Back to 5 stars if you get it fixed soon....."
"I dislike the new homescreen layout, before I could see all info I needed just by opening the app, now I've to scroll. also since the last update I can't import data from my omron blood pressure monitor. now I've sideloaded V5 (which does work with my omron) but Samsung keeps nagging me with a large popup to update to v6. No samsung ; as long as the sync is broken I don't upgrade"
"Update, now have to allow app to access phone and contacts. Requires Samsung two step verification, so now locked out. Will not buy another Samsung. In addition to earlier review, now see in Trends you have to press and hold on each daily bar to see previos days numbers. The walking man in steps just takes up a lot of screen space. This looks more like its trying to appeal to an extremely young crowd with the bright primary colors and moving graphics."
"This new version is a big step backwards in terms of functionality. It looks better, but they took stuff out. You can no longer get a weekly or monthly average of your weight, for example. That's the main reason I was using this app over others. I'll have to download a different one now to get that. Other features of this app are OK. Not great, but OK. Wouldn't recommend it over much better alternatives."
"Used to love this app until the recent update. It won't let me access it without permission to my contacts so I caved in and eventually agreed to it. But now I realized that the weight management feature is gone! Like, that was the whole purpose of this app. Very disappointed with the update."
"I brought this app from a Samsung to a Motorola... it seemed to work okay for a little bit but was always a struggle to get 6k steps. Bought a Fitbit & discovered that steps on Samsung Health were less than half of what the Fitbit recorded, even though I would have one on my wrist & one in my back pocket. For the past 6 months, the app barely records 1/3 of my regular steps, so it's just turned into a frustration. I will probably go back to a Samsung phone, but not this app."
Keeps updating to newer version without permission. Behaves more like a virus. The new version does not allow you to keep track of your spo2 readings or records it as previously. We bought these phones for this functionality you can't just remove stuff without consulting the customer first or give us at least the option to retain the older version.
"I accidentally rooted my phone while trying to recover some photos I had deleted and the app now won't open up ""because of security issues"" so now this app is simply wasting space on my phone and I can't seem to be able to delete it. I suppose I'll have to finally migrate from Samsung phones and apps."
"Why is this app rated so low? This is the best health app I've ever used. It tracks literally everything. Every single day I monitor my sleep, calories, workouts and weight. Then once in a while I'll upload my blood pressure and check the trend of my resting heart rate. I have 6 years of saved data I can skim through at the tips of my fingers. Anyone having technological issues is probably just bad with technology or they're buying cheap watches that don't sync well with this app."
"Using this to maintain my weight and track sleep. Does a great job of it. Would give it a 5 star but it doesn't have a bar code input for entering your food, which makes it alot easier & faster than manually inputting. If they ever decide to put that in I would give them a 5."
"I used to really enjoy this app, and had it for years. Sadly the new design has completely ruined it. It's a great app that I used to suggest for others, but unless the small tile design returns, I don't advocate this one. There are plenty others that offer better user experience and more app integrations."
"The old version was fine,but the new version doesn't work on my phone. I have a new Galaxy note 9 and when i try to open the app it says my phone is ""rooted"". My phone is NOT ROOTED! I contacted Samsung and they tried to tell me my phone is rooted but that is not the case! they emailed me a list of information that they wanted me to send them but I don't feel safe sending them my information. I'm not the only person that has this problem with my phone so it's definitely the app."
Great Tracker and awesome details on workouts. Great motivator to keep moving or get steps.. But I am missing the community feel like I had with FitBit. Also not able to connect with as many ppl on broader scale. Really wish there were more challenges. Update: I am enjoying some of the added features of a community feel. But I just realized that this watch/app doesn't track calories per BPM but based off of set weight.
"This was and still is a great health app, I use it all the time with my Samsung wearables, however this latest update has 1/3 page of advertising at the top of the screen taking away the nice clean looks of the health app, I have all advertising options turned off! My advice is do not update to this lates release, there are no useful add on benefits and the is no longer clean and as useful at a glance."
Like all the others that have posted you ruined a great app with your updates. Weight tracker gone stress tracker gone blood pressure tracker gone. Know that they might not been 100 percent accurate but they where not way off and they all where great assisting tools. With all reviews on update was bad you would think roll it back to when people where happy not wait and see if developers come up with something
"My experience with this one is quite terrible. Earlier I used to love this app, however with auto fill setting gone this app has became a nightmare. Like this if you want AUTOFILL setting and register your strong protest to SAMSUNG. Can't you give me your email address? So many people are giving you 1 star because you disabled Weight Management and changed settings through which I could run for mere 30 minutes and steps were more than 6000. I demand that previous Samsung health app be installed"
YOU MADE A MAJOR CHANGE WITH THE LATEST UPDATE. YOU NOW REQUIRE A SAMSUNG ACCOUNT TO SAVE AND RETRIEVE THE DATA and you don't let people know that upfront. Update at your own risk. Now I have to log in and share personal information just to measure my heart rate and see my history. Never had to do that in the past. Please remove the requirement. It is unacceptable. I have 2+ years if exercise data backed up on my phone but there is no way to reload it.
I hat this new update. It doesn't display the %% of nutrients/vitamins consumed. Instead...we have stupid bar charts. Much more difficult to see where you are at a glance. Edited to add...can't find anyplace that shows carb intake...it is all %%%. Guess I will go find a new app...this one is now useless to me for weightloss.
I have a problem with this app. I walked about 3km and the steps shown is no way even less than a third. Tried all the necessary settings. Still no good. I had another app Huawei health that was pre installed in my phone. It worked perfectly. My other app for today is currently on 7799 steps compared to the Samsung health app which shows only 8 steps. Yes 8 steps. Disappointing.
"I loved the app but this update ruined it. The weight loss manager is gone, now it's very difficult to calculate total daily burnt calories against input or see breakdown of calories with activity or set targets by modifying either at my convenience. without these features things like step count etc can be done just as well with other apps so i hope you bring these back or unroll update"
Don't like the new two step verification. It doesn't seem to work and why do you need access to my phone number. The app was perfect before. Plus if people really want to steal my heart rate information fine. It's not that valuable. Wish app would go back to way it was. Now it is a hassle and doesn't even work
"the running portion is having a lot of troubles as of recently. my last 5 runs it cut my milage short, showing that I went through tennis courts and through the park when I run around the park. it never had this problem before and it doesn't happen on my husband's phone (we both have galaxy s9 phones). every other function works well and is helpful to have all in one place."
"I have used the app for msny years and realy liked the functionality. However, since I have gone to a new S21+ phone with 5G capability, from the S8 edge +, i can not test for blood oxygen. Use to be able to hold my finger over the LED on the back of the S8 to measure. That function does not eork with the S21 as far as Ican tell!"
"You removed the previous review. Body composition is not working, support are no use at all. Can't even tell me if it's a software or hardware issue, so I'm trying anything to get assistance. The health app appears to be working, it was a hardware issue with no diagnostic feedback, I'll increase my review as soon as I see an improvement"
"Great app overall - I use it to measure steps, active time workouts and sleep and it gets the job done great. Easy to use and the steps challenges are fun. Edit: The last update fixed my previous issue. Thanks, Samsung! Now, the only gripe I have is that I don't know who can walk 200000 steps in 1 day ss the top people always seem to do. That's almost 200 km. in a day. For multiple days in a row. It seems like they may be cheating somehow. And this should be fairly easy to address."
"Docking another star as this is basic functionality ... What's really disappointed me is the inability to share a workout properly with friends. Selected a workout with a full mapped route, selected 'share' to send to route to a contact on Whatsapp and its just drawn the route on a static random stock photo Instead of the map so is useless."
Easy to use and works seamlessly with my Galaxy watch and Galaxy ear buds. I could only give it 4 stars because It does not allow me to look at previous days graphs. I can not compare my sleep data across days by any other means than the weekly graph which does not have enough information on it. The same with heart rate and exercise. I want to compare the details not just the amounts.
"I love the app and all the available types of workout selection available but please add all the types of workout available on the phone app to the watch app. If I use the ""Other Workout"" option on the watch and change it later with the correct workout on the phone app, the calorie burn is off. If I track on the phone app then I lose the heart rate tracking on my watch. We shouldn't have to pick one over the other."
"I have downloaded and uninstalled this app 3 times. It does not record proper stride length and no way to adjust it. The ""settings"" menu looks nothing like what Samsung says it should. There is no ""data and settings"" and ""profile"". Frustrating for sure."
"I used to really love this app a few updates ago, but it seems as though with each iteration, more of the features that I loved are being removed, especially in the most recent removal of several food/macro nutrient relates features. It's a shame because I recently bought a galaxy active 2 and had hoped that more features for that would appear on this app, so I worry what you will remove next."
Disappointing. Will not sync food logs from MyFitnessPal and tech support is not helpful. MFP support has been very helpful. Other than the app is decent and connects to my Samsung Gear Fit2 Pro well. If they could provide better tech support and resolve this issue I'd give them a better rating.
"Does not track iron, vitamin d, omega 3 fatty acids and magnesium. ""Women's health"" section is minimal and non descriptive and the ""log"" space is too small. Theres no setting that allows for Bowel Movememt tracking. I understand that they ""can't have everything"" whatever. I like everything else, but if youre going to be the optimal health tracker we need to be able to track everything. :("
The app is good but it used to be great It has lost a lot of features such as blood oxygenation measuring and quick measure without adding a real supplement. Last but not least it now also features advertisements which is running the overall experience and doesn't match the quality and price of the phones we buy.
"DON'T INSTALL 1. Is not compatible for smart watches/bands of competitors. Buying our favourite smart watches is our choice, there is no reason why smart watches of other brands are not compatible. Fitbit, MI etc., are not compatible. 2. Cannot create challenges with friends using IOS. Even I don't like to give 1 star, but that is the minimum to write a comment."
"Bring back the weight and calorie management features, and fix the horrible layout you switched to. Your august 5th update practically ruined the whole app. Jan 14th This update made things worse, in my opinion. Things are harder to read and find now, and the style is far less appealing than ever before. And we still dont have all the calorie/weight tracking features we had before. I might be looking for another app, this one just keeps disappointing me."
"I don't want to take away from the positives this app brings. However, I don't understand why the data you're collecting and saving can't be viewed using different metrics. For one, an average distance for the month is of no real use to me personally. However, total distance in that month would be incredibly useful to say ""you've done x miles this month"" because that would be really useful to have something to work towards. Do you know if this feature is something we can expect? Thanks!"
"I have used this app for a long time. I liked it because it gave me my weekly and monthly average for my blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen level, etc. That was very helpful as a quick reference at my doctor's appointments. Would you please add back the TRENDS function? Update: Feb. 18, 2021 Please let me know how to reinstate the old version of Samsung Health so that I can once again track my health trends, highs, lows, and averages on a weekly, monthly and longterm basis.You have not fixed it."
"Issues all over the place. It was working fine for months. Then, without warning, it refuses to log in. Asks for password, 2 step authentication and then says ""name can not be resolved"" or ""unexpected error 0xB0"" or something similar. I wouldn't mind, but I need the app to get my Samsung Watch Classic4 to work. So my advice? Find something better."
"Amazing app. You can find almost everything you may eat or drink. Tracks your workouts, food intake, nutrient details. It calculates the nutrietions intake vs the recommended. You must try this app to realize much more than what I am writing here. Minus one star just because I could not find one type of cheese, but already shared a request via the app to add it."
"Was alot better before update. When viewing your carbs, fat, and protein the colors for carbs and fat are to close you can hardly tell the difference. You really have to look or angle your phone to see it. This was a easy check in seconds before and now a huge pain in the ass. I no longer have the option to see if I'm over or under my calories on the main screen of the app. Thinking about using ""My Fitness Pal"" app instead. Its to bad I really enjoyed this app before these changes."
"this app so far is mostly good, would be better if able to adjust/enter in steps or be able to sync it with Fitbit. i don't take my phone everywhere so it doesn't capture the full picture to be beneficial to continue using daily."
"Have been using this app for over a year now and decided today to get a Samsung Fit to sync with it. Connected fine, tracks steps fine but why has it calculated my average speed during an auto detected workout to be 9.8mph when the maximum recorded was 3.9mph. Very disappointed, would like an explanation."
"I really enjoy this app and use it a lot, but I have the same pet peeve with this app as I do with MANY other health trackers: there is no way to track menstrual cycles! Please consider adding this very simple option. Menstrual cycle has major impacts on sleep, weight, energy, mood, diet, water intake... and it's very important to the health of roughly half your users. It would be great to have ALL of my relevant health information in one place instead of having to go back & forth between apps."
"Please can I uninstall this version and go back to the previous? Really liked the previous version, easy with all the info right on the dash board. This version is clumsy and forces you to open and scroll every single time you want to track an activity . Very frustrating"
"I own a Samsung Watch and I love how it's synced to the Samsung Health automatically. However, the widget on my phone for this app is just pathetic. There could be more developments for e.g., a widget options for logging period connected to the Women's health section of the app or an overall view of our activity level like the Samsung Watch face display."
"It's pretty good, but wish it gave more insights into the data. For example: It tells you how much sleep you got, how much was REM, etc., but doesn't tell you what to do with that data. Suggestions on improving sleep quality or whatever. Overall though, it's a good app."
"Can't use the app. Can't sign in and the few times I get pat that screen, I can't go further than the 2 factor authentication screen. It doesn't leave much hope for security if the security measure can't even be set up. This needs a fix asap."
The O2 Saturation measurement as a stand alone measurement is now gone. You now have to measure your stress level (which takes longer) in order to read your O2 Saturation. You also can't see your past data unless you download your data. Why was this removed? Health app was perfect and then Samsung finds a way to ruin it. App on a Galaxy S10+. Downgrading to the factory installed version until this is added back. Making sure the old apk is backed up to to prevent Samsung from forcing an update.
Nope! Now it needs phone and contact access. The App cannot be used now until you give full permission to both. ( with no clear oversight of why they added this requirement or the extent they can use it) So as a fitness tracker it's useless as no one should have to provide that access. This also messes up my S Gear as I can't synch it to phone any more.
Not accurately tracking from Samsung Active2. I've checked my steps & it's not updating them right at all. Yes I've refreshed & done my homework. This seems to be a problem over all & I really hope this is fixed ASAP. I don't think anyone wants to see their money completely wasted as they are to depend on their watch & app activities to function together properly.
"The new interface for the activity is terrible. I don't enjoy the fact that steps, exercise and calories are all put together. Also, it is now impossible to get an average measure on exercise by either week or month. Very disappointing."
"Your reaction is unrelated to my comment. COMMENT: Thank you for explaining that access to ""contacts"" is needed for the app to login. I do find it really strange that you need access to all my contacts just to verify that I am signed in. Especially since you state ""no required permissions"". Without the contacts permission I can't open the app - so it is required... That is misleading and I doubt it is GDPR-conform since my contacts are certainly not necessary for you to collect. Please update!"
"After an update, without warning, the app started sending me unsolicited notifications. These unexpected, unsolicited notifications are unacceptable. I am quite sour that an app that came pre-installed, can update itself and decide for me that I want notifications from it. The response from Samsung below mentions ads, which were not a part of my original review. This demonstrates that samsung is just using premade responses instead of addressing customer concerns."
We just purchased 2 galaxy watches instead of the fitbits because we have samsung watches and tvs. But we are unable to add friends on either of our devices via samsung health using the send link option. tech support was no help as they seemed oblivious that it didnt work even after sending data logs. figured out on my own that we can add via qr code since we were in same room. but adding anyone else in future via link i have zero confidence right now. good app otherwise.
"I love this app. I also enjoy the challenges each month. I have lost 60 lbs using this app and with diet Thank you so much. Ok, I'm 70 y/r's old and some of us older people can't quite get to the stars in time, however I have made the 200,00 steps in the month and I don't get the globe? That's not a bit fair. Maybe you should rethink this app. Nevermind, I found a better app. You need to fix the app on your end ."
"Bring Back the Weight Management! I have been looking for this setting to play around with how much I should loose each week and learned it was removed. Why?!?!?! Also, my daily calorie limit I set keeps reverting from the correct 1800 to random numbers such as 1700 and 1960. I keep making sure it is set at 1800 but it keeps glitching."
"Keeps crashing. Does not want to open the running part. I tried everything restart phone, uninstall app, i guess just have to uninstall and try a different app. *update* 4/29/20 I did call the number for customer service and it was not helpful. All customer service told me to do was uninstall app clear cache and reinstall, after doing that I lost practically 3 weeks worth of workouts. It had not save my workouts for the past 3 weeks. I am so disappointed with that."
"I loved this app until the new update. The calorie tracker was removed. It was a quick easy way to see how much more exercise I needed compared to what I had consumed. I also had a glitch today where when I went for a bike ride it did not record my distance or speed just the time I was active, I might as well have been sitting on a stationary bike, very disappointed."
Really nice app! I like using it to track my steps and my activity when I go skiing. It is very accurate! I don't always enter data when I workout so I don't really like using the food/calorie intake recommendations because of my level of physical activity and high metabolism
"For mindfulness, please add the option of playing one track without repeat, and the option of specifying the number of repeats. Also, where is the option for activating the blood oxygen sensor on the back of the S9 by flipping the phone."
Ever since your last update my phone does hardly count steps anymore. I can walk all over the area and the step count is 0! Not satisfying at all - used to be very accurate. I've installed an additional step counter to make sure it's not the phone sensor creating the problem - that app is counting all my steps. But just to amuse myself I'm going to test the sensor.
"There are lots of bugs in the new update! I'm removing it! After the last update, there is a bug in the nutrient intake summery and it shows the required dairy amount of protein, fiber, iron and so on are zero! I could not any more use this app to observe my intake nutritions. Moreover, it had problem with counting my steps!"
I liked the last platform better. when I set a weight goal it calculated how many calories I could have In order to maintain 500 calories less than I burned. i can no longer do that. I might have to look in to other apps which sucks because I have a Samsung watch. everything else I love!
"Very disappointing app. Vendor locked to this because I made the mistake to buy Galaxy Watch. List of sports is absolutely 90's so anyone interested in calisthenics/crossfit and tracking the sport properly is just out of luck (no dips, muscle ups, levers, ...). Measuring anything non-time-based has zero precision (1 squad in real life translates to 0.01 squads measured and I've never seen stairs counter working) and calories intake is really only useful if you live in the US and purchase stuff in standard stores/chains. Only useful thing I found so far is no activity reminders, but talking me into doing 6 squads if you can't count them properly is pointless and plain annoying."
"I use to really like this app because of the ease of use and the immediate ability to measure heartrate, oxygen level stress among other things. Now this updated version has removed that option. I assume its because some people have smart watches and sync them with this app. What about those of us who have zero desire to get a smart watch or Fitbit? Now we dont have that immediate availability to measure important vital statistics related to our health. That's not fair!! Please return that optio"
"Great App, Tracks step count and syncs perfectly with my Gear Fit. Strangely though the app doesn't count my step randomly on my OP7, and App needs to be opened again to start the counting. Tried tricks like disabling battery optimisation, but still doesnt work. Dear Samsung developer pls address this issue."
"I tried to update this app but now it won't work at all. I get an error message saying that ""unauthorized changes"" were made to my phone and to contact customer service. My phone is not rooted (I checked) and all of my apps have been downloaded from the Google Play store. Please fix this right away! Ugh!!!"
"One of the downsides of having a Samsung phone is the lack of commitment by the manufacturer. They suddenly decided to remove SpO2 feature from their app without rolling out the new version first. Stress Management, that includes SpO2 measurement, is going to replace the old SpO2 measure, however, it's only rolled out within US. Why? Maybe because Samsung doesn't care about rest of the world!"
"I have used this app for years, but now they require the permission of telephone for you to connect with people which is something I don't require and there is no way to bypass it. It's our privacy and choice whether we want the connect with other users or not. Uninstalling till the time they don't make it optional or remove it."
"I have used this app for a long time and loved it. Recently, an error has been occurring and the app gives me an error message saying that my phone is rooted. I have tried some simple troubleshooting suggested online to no avail. my phone is not rooted, just an S8+ in great condition."
"Used for ages. Now Samsung wants to demand ridiculous and invasive permissions. Access ALL files and phone, ummm no. Plus, my watch is now pretty much useless. Why do you need to spy on your customers? It's creepy. Your explanation is absurd. If it was in any way sufficient, there would not have been additional complaints. You don't need access to our phone or files to track meals, weight or exercise. This is overreach."
I like using this app but I swear every update makes it harder to delete sleep records. My Galaxy Fit gets my evening routine confused with sleep a lot so I go back at some point and clean up the records but the delete option is pushed into more menus every time. Only downside I've noticed from casual use so keep up the good work
Up untill this latest update the app was pretty good with some very useful functions namely the ability to look at averages over a week & month this is very useful when tracking weight & % body fat as it takes into account daily fluctuations however this update does away with that. My advise is don't update until it's brought back in. Very disappointed Samsung
"This is a great app, very premium features. the only thing I would suggest is an integrated barcode scanner for adding food in the calorie intake function. no critique, this is very well designed app. I also wanted to add I just got the galaxy watch which also has Samsung Health and the two work great together! Having the watch really takes the fitness game up a few notches. I have a Note8 and Galaxy Watch. Just for users information."
I loved this app UNTIL the update. I strongly agree with others that the Weight Management section was the most useful in managing weight loss. No other app I looked at had this feature. It was essential to altering calorie intake based on calories burned. Now I have no idea what intake and burned should be to facilitate weight loss!
"I generally like the app but the weight function no longer updates as of September 23, 2021. I really want to keep using this to track activity, food, water, and weight but if weight doesn't work there's no point to anymore then I'll have to find another app to track my health."
"Simple and easy to use app, but the new update is a worse interface. My reminders have also randomly been pushed back 30 minutes with the new update and I can no longer find the section to change them back to their original time."
"Great app, enjoying all the features paired with my galaxy watch. I really wish they fixed some of the cheating on the step count. There's no way to humanly achieve the steps some people get per day and it takes away from the fun of the monthly contest."
"You ruined it!! I've been using this everyday for years to track my calories and now not only is the new interface ugly, but going back to previous dates is a chore and you can't select individual dates without scrolling all the way back to them. Uninstalled and I'll start using Cronometer now!"
When I hear music using Samsung music while running using Samsung health I face a problem that songs didn't complete till the end and suddenly another song starst shortly then stop and a new one comes next.... Jumping from one song to another without completing any one till the end.. I need an explanation for that with consideration that I save music in the internal memory. My phone is galaxy A71.
"Fails to auto record walks about 80% of the time. When it does, it has at least a 10 min delay on start and sometimes stops recording somewhere along the way. It's about the only thing I use it for and it has the accuracy of a potato..."
Loved this app have had it for years. Recently the widget I had on my wall disappeared and just says updating. Tried Uninstaller and reinstalling th app. but will not go on my wall continues to say updating. Very discouraged going to look for another that the widget will appear on my screen more convenient to keep track. Please fix loved it before. Thank you
"Loved and used this app to track my walking and hiking for years. However, since the recent update, I cannot get pass the ""Agree to privacy policy"". You want too much access to my data, such as phone and contacts. I'll uninstall this app as soon I can find another one that is not so invasive. UPDATE:Just uninstalled it. 2021/06/10."
I am obliged to use this cause it's connected with Galaxy Watch Active I was expecting to have a good sleep analysis..but it's disappointing. If i have 3 sleeps per night it's not showing the total..it's showing only for the specific time. Please improve ! Update: this is the only application where you need to call for improvement! Really??!! Is anyone calling international??
I liked it before. Now it is useless. Bring back WEIGHT MANAGEMENT.... it was very helpful. Without the weight management the Samsung watches and the Samsung Health application are worthless ...Not worth buying. The last update has made the application very intrusive and took away TOGETHER INFORMATION (Challenges). YOU Now HAVE TO MAKE YOUR INFORMATION etc discoverable to participate and see how you are doing on the Challenges. Their advice is get another aplication for WEIGHT MANAGEMET
"Not impressed. I used to sync the app to my watch data and enjoyed the trend view and the challenges. But this version -I will never give an app permission to make calls. There are plenty of other apps out there that don't need this to make their apps work. So your stock answer to other complaints ""making the app features work"" is rubbish. What features need access to make phone calls? Be transparent and honest and stop fobbing people off with a reply that doesn't actually say anything."
"Entering meals (calories) is difficult, because you can't choose what unit of measurement, and options are not good at times, so i prefer to use the Lose it app for calorie counting. You cannot scan bar codes to input your calories, but you can with Lose it."
"Have just started using this with my Samsung watch - loads of really great features. To improve user experience further, I would like the weight measurement units to include lbs and stones please. Could this be added in the next release of functionality and then it would work really well with UK scales and the units we use at Slimming World. It just makes it quicker to see, track and understand progress. Finally, is it possible to also measure blood pressure as well as heart rate? Thanks üòä"
"The app is amazing. Just 2 changes are required for the betterment: 1) Allow the user to record the sleep time in the any odd numbers, rather than recording the time only in the multiples of 10. 2) There was a feature previously, in which the App itself used to create Team under the Challenges section, please bring back that feature again."
"I do love the app so much, I use all day everyday...but I am not sure what happened with the last update! My watch will record my workouts but once I end my workout it says I haven't workout!! BUT then my watch does send the info to my phone! I do wish someone would fix my issue!! üòî I so love my Samsung Health when it works!! And that's when I uninstall and reinstall every other day! üôè please fix! I want make my rating 5 again!!"
"Functional Changes to Samsung Health makes this app less than desirable and not as useful. Yes. It is nice to use the Galaxy Watch, but it was a great advantage to have the ability to use both. My Galaxy Watch sensor is not working so I loved how my Galaxy Note would capture my pulse, measure stress, and Auto detect a workout [my favorite] are all gone from the Galaxy Note. This is why I don't like to get use to using Samsung related apps because I understand you move Development Teams off."
"I've been using it since 2015. But, the new update is horrible. *I have to edit my review again for the 2nd time. They changed the food tracker yet again and it is way worse. Now, when you select a food item it doesn't show foods that are frequently added with that food. Why change something that was so useful? And you cant track ounces to decimals anymore. Every time they update the app they make the most pointless changes. So glad I got the generic response from the devs /s"
"Just number of steps don't mean any thing. Distance of a stride and the SPEED with which the steps are taken, all have to enter in the calculation for the distance walked and the speed at which the distance was covered as well as uphill downhill etc has to enter into the calculation for calories spent. Option for distance to be in miles as well as kilometers will be helpful as we have on treadmill and exercise machines."
"App functionality is very nice, but connection with strava is hardly working. I need to remove and add the connection with Strava in S Health after every workout to sync the workour from S Health to Strava. Edit: feedback helped, thanks. Still some other (minor) issues though. Not sure whether it's my Active2 or the app."
"Had to uninstall and reinstall this latest version. It was very unstable and perpetually restarting. It is running ok since the reinstall. Update : it's slow, and as it's monitoring my sleep and walking patterns tells me to ""try and take a walk"" at 4:30 am in the morning. How clueless is that? Sleep and exercise in contraposition to each other. Stupid AI. Update: Stupid AI now tells me at midnight every day (I read the alert on in the mornings) that I should ""take a walk""... Watch sees asleep."
"All of a sudden, the wants to make calls from my phone, following a change in the privacy policy and unless I grant the permission, the app won't allow me any access üòí Therefore, it's uninstalled. I tried contacting you on the number you provided. It's not recognised. Quite like the comments of the dissatisfied customers of this application. I see that there is a new build for this application. However, I will not install it, until you remove the permissions to access my calls and make calls."
"Bad update in mid Jan 2021. Also, after the recent update in mid April 2021, as the two-step verification setting cannot be successfully done, it did not even allow me to enter the app, saying that my samsung session is already expired. I am thinking to switch another app."
"great app! i paired my gear fit to it and i tracks everything for me. I like how if my watch dies, it still tracks my steps and adds them all together. I like how it shows me my trends on things and I can save the data by syncing it onto my drive. lol all in all I love it, even if I happen to have an LG its still better."
"Features disappear with app updates. I used to test oxygen level and no longer can. UPDATE features continue to disappear. What happened to the ability to see trends? I recorded my weight in this app for years and found it helpful to see my weekly and monthly averages, the trends. Now it's gone and I had to create a spreadsheet to see my trends."
"Used to love the app, especially the Step tracking, sleep tracking, tracking of certain sports, heart rate and oxygen monitoring and the breathing exercises. I can't access the app anymore, it wants unnecessary permissions to continue and apparently from other reviews my most used features like the stress tracker have been removed. I can only use the step tracking currently and it is always lower than the Google Health tracker. I will not give this app any permissions and not use it anymore."
The app is not syncing with my Galaxy Watch 4 classic's steps. My watch has more steps registered then the app. I have put to display all and it still not showing the correct number. I have update the app and the watch and still doesn't work. The app is sync to the watch. I really not happy since I bought this watch and the app is making it worst.
"pretty good app, accurate step counter on the note 9, lots of features. I dont use to most of them so I am unsure how useful/accurate they are. But there is one feature that is missing that I miss from the huawei health app. The Huawei health app had a ""item"" that told you how many days out of 30 days you've reached your goal and a percent of ""days goal reached"". it was helpful in pushing me to reach my daily steps goal ."
"This app is broken. When I try to sign in it forces me to set up 2 step verification. Once I sign in for that, it's a blank white screen, if you try to back out it just forces you through the same exact endless loop. This needs to be fixed. App is non functional"
"Great health app, does all the usual (steps, activities, sleep tracking, etc etc) quite well, and works well with my galaxy watch 4. However, it would be nice if there was an option to follow a gpx route file, this feature seems like it would be really easy to add, and it can't take much battery since it works on old garmin watches just fine. If anyone from samsung sees this, please could you add this feature, with it this app would definitely be 5 stars."
"I'm having the same issue as several people. The app is recording steps for the day, but the trends are gone, so I can't look back to the prior days to see how many steps I've taken. It wipes out the prior day when I open today. Very frustrating. Ready to dump it and look for another app. It was working well for me until now."
"horrible update! Daily meals have been reduced from 6 (breakfast, snack, lunch, snack, dinner, snack) to only 4 (Breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack). Please bring back multiple meals, or option to add more meals. I keep odd hours because of work, and my between-meal snacks (and timings) are as important as my main meals."
"A huge backward step, very disappointed in the new design. Cannot track any other sports other thank walking, it is not easy any more where are the swimming or dancing items???? I agree with the recent users im not satisfied with the app anymore please redesign the same way of the old one"
"Used to be good, the app was how I lose over 45 pounds and then they went and removed the weight management part of the app and has rendered it useless. I was going to buy their Watch 3 and now will go back to Fitbit. Bring it back please! I will put it back to 5 stars once the feature returns! I really need this to come back! It was so confident and I just bought a watch 3 for this reason and now it's gone from there too :'( still no update pleaseeee"
"The food diary does not track or even mention sugars in food consumption, so its pretty much useless. It shows every other nutrient though. Fitness videos are good but the yoga moves so fast it's impossible to keep up. It is a really well planned app but actual user experience needs work."
"This app is not compatible with other Android devices. It was amazing when I had a Samsung, but it is horrible with my Huawei. It's not accurately tracking my steps and stops abruptly when doing exercises. No compatibility means I'm losing out on tracking and thus losing on discovery points."
"In fact I can't get this stupid app to work. For the last two days I've been getting an ""unknown error "" message. I've reloaded it many, many times only to get same message again. This means that my expensive Galaxy watch is good for nothing except to tell time. I could have used my ordinary watch for that."
"Earlier it was good, but now day accuracy level is very poor, sometimes it's captured less distance some double distance than actual. Today (28th Sep21) i walked 7km and app also showing 7 km while walking, but after finishing the walk it was showing 3.67 km only and also captured further date of 2 October 21. Very bad experience Not expected from Samsung"
"Not sure what the heck has been happening with sleep recording lately, but it has been way off. Please let people update it and still get their data. It shouldn't be so hard to get accurate data."
"Update made Samsung Health even worse! I didn't think Samsung Health could actually be more frustrating to use than it already was but they accomplished it. I eat six times a day. Now it lumps all of my ""snacks"" together. The food choices were never good and that hasn't changed. I wind up having to enter 90% of the calories, fat, carbs , etc. manually. #SMH Gone are the weekly averages that were replaced with seven day running totals. Probably time to go back to a Fitbit."
"No way to provide bug reports about the app easily. I have a screenshot of an issue where you can't edit already recorded sleep data even though the option to manually record it is there. ""Sleep data already recorded for this time period"". So I have no way to revise bad sleep data. This app also told me to give it a permission it already had for notification access. Had to toggle it on and off to get the notification to go away. This app is like okay but needs polish."
Doesn't allow you to connect with others. Perhaps look at fitbit app and see how u can build friends and always keep in contact with them for motivation and for step challenges. Also dont like the step challenges they are short time frame and u can't really tell ur opponent more than a few words.
"Really inflexible workout data input, can't adjust amount of water in a ""glass"", the 50 character limit on workout notes is ridiculous and FAR too many ads for Samsung products given that I'm already using one. I'm relieved the next gen of Samsung watches is switching to WearOS because it means I can switch back to Google Fit!"
"I have to be honest, I personally think this was and is one of the best fitness apps out there but recent updates have really disappointed me. Before I could see steps from my galaxy watch separately from the ""all steps"" option in the steps part of the app but they have now removed this and merged watches with all steps. This is frustrating because all steps is not accurate and includes inflated figures from your phone along with your total. I will be returning my watch because of this."
The heart rate and stress measurements are totally hit or miss. It rarely works properly. Often says my finger isn't properly on the sensor when it is. Totally useless in its current iteration. In the past it was marginally better.
"This is useless and buggy. Stops syncing sleep data with watch, there's a huge ad in hungarian about buying the same watch I already have. For a feature not available in Hungary (blood pressure). Which need yet another phone app, which is galaxy store only. Come on, I bought an expensive watch, installed 3 apps, and still cannot see how I slept. The watch only show the last night sleep interval and that's it, telling that cannot get the records from phone. Also I miss the spO2 drops during sleep"
"I like the nutrient intake summary! I find it very useful, but I would like to be able see cholesterol and trans fat in the summary as well. These are items I have to track and it would save me time if it was already included in the summary."
"With the last update the app got worst hence only 2 starts from me. The one that really bothers me is that now you can't track anymore the progress of your weight, blood pressure etc over months/weeks you can only do it at day level. I can see here loads of people have a problem with this and have rated the app with one star. Whoever came up with this update obviously didn't do any UX research with their customer base, not sure why Samsung went ahead with this, maybe to annoy the app users ü§îüôÇ"
"I'm so annoyed with the latest update. Who in the right mind would remove weight management that was the highlight of the app, me being diabetic help me alot, even though my calories were right but the weight management would encourage me to burn calories to meet my target. Now its gone I'm forever figuring it out, why would u do that ,colours, digital useless, giving it 1 star for tht reason . It was simple all u needed to do is add and it would workout all for u . Plz bring it back ASAP."
I came from a fitbit and the app is leaps and bound more useful than this one. Nothing aboit this is layed out well or easy to use. You cant easily see past days calories burned but that doesnt matter because your activity isnt factored in anyways. It is a joke that they can put an active name on a watch and it not have anything to do with tracking activities. Complete trash
This app was great but they ruined it. It used to tell you how many steps were at a good pace. Now even a slow stroll counts the same as a vigorous walk. Also I used to try to keep my monthly average up. They don't count it anymore. Those 2 items used to motivate me. Now no motivation.
"The app is lacking a lot of important features. For example, if you forgot to end your workout on your watch, there's no way to fix it on your watch or in the app. There's also no menstrual tracker which is pretty disappointing."
"Ever since my phone upgraded to Pie the step counter doesn't update regularly from my Gear Fit2 watch. It'll say something like 187 steps in the late afternoon when the watch says something like 1500. (reply to Samsung. The fix doesn't make sense. There's nothing called Pedometer. I can go into the Step Counter but there's no More button and I don't see ""pause counting steps"" anywhere)"
"Newest update keep losiing features. Just dropped the latest as the primary reason I used it is weight management which just got dropped. Becoming a worthless bloatware app at this rate Update, following others, samsung has continued too destroy features. With a mindless bot responding to every review. You can side install the older versions to have the original functionality. Just make sure not to have it auto update."
"Was working really well until recent update. Most functions still ok but the stress measuring component causes the app / phone (S9) to freeze as soon as the finger is placed over the hrm. Strangely though, the hrm still works on its own if just measuring heart rate? Here's hoping that Samsung come up with a fix soon."
"Latest update removed all voice integration with my Samsung phone including making all my Bixby quick commands useless. This was the only thing I used it for so there's no reason for it to be on my phone now. Uninstalling. Edit: Hi Samsung rep, I'm pretty sure calling won't get your team to put back the voice features they deliberately removed, but thanks for the reply I guess. I hope you pass these along to management."
I find this app useful overall. I wonder why there is no feature of racquet sports like badminton on the Samsung gear watch but there is such feature on the Samsung health app. The reading don't tally at all. Hope this can be something to look at. As I am looking forward to a wearable that sync my racquet sports to track my activities. Thank you
"Used to be great but recently its not been counting my steps all the time. I have to go onto the app for it to start counting my steps again, but a minute or so later it will stop. I have to keep deleting the app then getting it back for it to work properly again. But even that doesn't help for a long time, just 2 days ago i deleted it and got it back again and now its stopped counting my steps. Please fix this ASAP"
"Love this app. It's fun to use and track steps all day. It's most effective when you log every part of your daily activities. Ie, steps, food, water, sleep and workouts. I didn't give it 5 stars because it's not very efficient with the workout tracking. If you do a hiit cardio, you won't be able to track that routine separately."
"It's a great app but I had to uninstall because it kept updating everytime I go to the bathroom at night. At different times of the night, like 7 to 10 ""updates"" each night within 3 minutes. It was weird. Before you people start asking yes I was on WiFi and I did force stop it but it came back up in 5 seconds to update.."
"The notifications system could improved. I sometimes find it hard to compare previous day data easily. The global challenge is interesting. Adding food is clunky, it would be so much better if I could scan barcodes in."
"After latest update the app no longer computes heart rate based on age. It just assumes everyone is 20 ... and I'm not anywhere close to 20. The watch is fine the app sucks at this. The watch will accurately say I was aerobic but the app will say fat burn. App just not good right now. Edited: I contacted, they focused on resetting the watch. The watch is NOT the problem, the App is. The app has a bug that needs fixed."
"*EDIT TO RESPOND* HOW DOES IT IMPROVE SERVICES??? I call BS. Provide CLEAR EXPLANATIONS, not vague double speak. *Original* I have used this app for many years, and although I sometimes wish it had more user friendly functionality, it has been fine. UNTIL the most recent update. Now they ask for access to MAKE AND MANAGE PHONE CALLS?? Absolutely not. There is no conceivable reason a fitness tracking app should EVER need to make or manage calls, or require it as a condition for using the app."
"I don't know why I am giving this app even a 2 star, thats may be because previously I used to love this app for the accuracy of its step count and walking location records. But now it is totally ruined after the update. I walk 6km everyday and I turn on the walk tracker but at the end of it shows only 0.67km or something like that everytime. Pls fix this one quickly!!! Its bugged!!"
"I was really enjoying this apl, until the latest up updat(August 7?). The sleep cycle is now split and no longer linked with my scheduled sleep time. It is now showing/starting at midnight, vs the actual sleep start time of 8pm. When checking tends, it is now recording 2 separate scores; 1before midnight on 1 day, then 1 after due to the sleep starting and running into ""2"" days. WHY ON EARTH WOULD YOU CHANGE THIS?? This makes no sense, and is difficult to understand/read. Please change back!!!!!"
I used to love the app. In 2019 I lost over 80lbs using the apps calorie management tool. But after the recent update which removed it. The app is useless and in turn so is my samsung smart watch. Balancing calories was literally the only point of tracking my food and exercise. Also I cant compare my steps with the world anymore which sucks
"When you set and complete a distance target (i.e. running), the time doesn't automatically stop. You have to manually end the workout. This throws off the actual time it took to finish the workout. There needs to be an update to fix this"
Very poor at keeping distance. Developers need to bring the app back to the beginning. (5 or 7 years ago?). App thinks a 1 mile run is .25... and no it has nothing to do with being behind on updates. I am up to date. The app does have wonderful features and has come a long way.
"Great app... but serious flaws Why does this app. Need access to my phone & messages ? Why is there no print options... Why is there no export data so that Doctors can view ? Love the step counting, heart beat options. The latest revision does not include sleep patterns/times on weekly updates.. (was a really great feature on older versions) New versions moved, made harder to view, your weekly/daily averages. Contact to Samsung developer harder to find... could only publish this web review."
"This new version has a terrible new feature in which it sabotages your notifications and lock screen with a permanent notification message tracking your step count: ""Your target for today is 10000, let's get going!"" I have tried to remove that ""new feature"", but the only way I can see to do that is by turning off all notifications from Samsung Health which I don't want to do. What the heck Samsung developers?!"
"With the latest update for the beginning of May 2021, I would need to give permission to access my contacts, my camera, my SD card, etc. to use Samsung Health. That is not happening. With the ever increasing lack of privacy from smartphone app developers, I will recommend buying another product that does not require you to give up your privacy to use it. Update: I have deleted the app after I got a reply from the app developer. There is no reason the app needs to access your contacts, ever!"
"samsung health is good, however, it does not provide a baseline physical model for the individual. the app only asks for the individuals weight. weight is not the only aspect measured in personal physical fitness. the app should also take into account height, current fitness level and diet. To include muscle mass the individual already has. Mass has a major effect on the weight of the person which will alter the what the app records and recommends to the individual."
I've been using Samsung health app for years and decided to update it so that it can link to my other apps. The update straight up sucks! It does NOT have the wait maintenance section in the app anymore. It's very limited and the information that is linked to the other app does not come through correctly. I wish I didn't update. Two thumbs DOWN!!!
Loved this app until I let it update over the weekend. Now nothing works. Used to give all the nutritional info simply by tapping on the the item. Now it just gives me a blank chart and won't give me a total calorie count as the day progresses. Why fix something if it isn't broken?
Newest update on galaxy watch 4 has essentially made tracking workouts useless. It randomly pauses workouts even with auto-pause off and if you don't notice right away your whole workout could potentially not be tracked. I went for a run and 1 hour in I went to complete my session and it had manually paused me 10 minutes in meaning all 50 minutes after were not tracked. Garbage update made the app on watch worse than ever.
"Samsung Health App is amazing in a few features. But in some features like meditation, fitness and others for these we should have to pay for the basic learning also. Where as the consultation and premium is ok. And also, I request to add more features regarding health issues and to analyze it everyday. Reminder is also not good. Now a days, the app is not getting updated. Where the mb is also getting waste for updating."
"The app was pretty well till a short time ago. Today the app registers the running period and the walking period during the workout, but if you want to check it later, it'll be all accumulated under the active time. I find that really frustrating."
"App does nothing but spins little squares and says updating. It's been updating for the past 3 weeks. Something really wrong here. I've used it for a long time. Past 3 weeks, not at all. Guess I'll get a Fitbit since Samsung has so many problems."
"I loved the app and used it as a central hub for all of my physical activity and kept eating journals, managing my weight goals and reaching them was easy... now they have taken away one of the two main features that this app is used for... without the weight management I see no reason to stick with Samsung health over myfitnesspal and mapmywalk..."
Email them 2 times with a error .I cant get into my samung health app on my galaxy s8 just started happening .still no reply. Cant continue my weight loss goal if I can't get in yet seem like no one Is at the other end to help.. Thank you Samsung health for fixing it .. I updated my phone and it fixed the issue . Koodo did a update and restarted and it work ... thank u for fixing it . Penny
"Was liking the app then I unfortunately I updated now it wants to have access to my contacts, be able to make phone calls, camera, mic etc OR IT WON'T WORK. My trust in Samsung doing the right thing with my data is the same as my rating. RESPONSE - then make it my decision to allow it or not, dont deny access to it."
"No longer synch properly with Samsung Fit watch. Loses chunks of steps during the day. Says it has synced but step count completely different (e.g. had 19k on the watch and just 4k on the app). Also no longer records all exercise - again the watch automatically detects but doesn't get saved to the app. Makes stats meaningless. Tried clearing cache, restarting watch, reinstall app etc. But persistently doesn't synch. Very disappointing as very good previously- may uninstall."
"Yesterday I have bought galaxy fit 2. But I can't access it's full functionality because I can't sign into Samsung Health app. Once I input my log in data, it just shows never ending loading screen. Very disappointed. Especially because the first impression for a newly bought device has been ruined. I expected a higher quality app support from Samsung, and hence chose to buy galaxy fit over mi band 5."
I use this app to sync my Samsung Gear Fit to my Galaxy S8 Edge. Since the watch last updated it no longer syncs my sleep info to the app. It only goes off of when the phone thought I was asleep but I know the sleep was recorded correctly on the watch because it shows my sleep hours and motionless sleep percentage on the watch.
"Since the December 28th update exercise tracking has gone crazy! I use automatic recognition when I play tennis (because Samsung Watch Active can't recognise tennis, I have to edit afterwards from 'generic workout' to 'tennis'). As tennis is a stop-start game, I usually end up with four or five recorded 'generic workouts' in each session. Today, one of these 'workouts' lasted just 10 mins 52 secs. Samsung Health credited me with 644 calories for this!! I've never seen such a ridiculous result."
"So far so good, I am only new to this app so still navigating my way through. To make it next level a bar code so you can add your own foods to the app would be awesome. With the weight training it would great to be able track how many sets and reps plus rest time you are doing instead of pressing start and only having a timer."
"The app was great until the last update just kills my battery. When I open the battery stats menu it says I've used the app actively in the foreground for hours and hours, which obviously isn't true since i haven't opened the app for days. I've also tried clearing the cache and all the stored user data. Re-installed the app and I'm still experiencing the same issue. I might have to uninstall and then try it out again after a few updates. Using my Gear Sport with OnePlus 7 Pro."
Was great before the latest update. They decided to make the sleep tracking a high contrast night mode white on black. I can hardly read it now! Do they seriously think someone is going to look at their sleep tracking at night while your supposed to be sleeping? At least provide the option to go back to black on white. Also not a fan of the corny slide down screen. Why do developers constantly mess with things that are already working?
I got iconx buds for Christmas and attempted to hook everything up to my personal phone (pixel 3xl) and it is not updating. I checked if it would work on my Samsung work phone and it connects and works perfectly. I have spent 2 days checking everything and I am left with the conclusion that it is your app for the Android that is the issue. There is no reason why my information from the same account shouldn sync up and I can't get my iconx to download workouts on the pixel shealth app.
Why can't you provide an option to sync data with Google fit. I use wear OS watch and band sometimes. Difficult for me to track all activities in one place. Every 3 days the watch hangs while receiving notifications. It needs reboot. Please fix as it is a major issue.
"This app keeps cheating me of my steps and even though I keep it running in the background, where it will drain my battery consistently, it still can't track my steps. I don't mind if the app is battery intensive but the least it can do is properly track my steps. I can't be losing 5000 steps a day, especially when I am taking part in the national step challenge. I really regret downloading this app and whoever that hopes to download this, I hope you look at this review and reconsider."
"Cannot be linked to MyFitnessPal (MFP) for food intake. Despite the fact that is able to try and connect, it is Samsung Health that blocks all permissions. EDIT IN REPLY TO SAMSUNG COMMENT: I have tried clearing Cache and Data. I have uninstalled and reinstalled the app... and now I have just purchased a new Galaxy S22 Ultra and the same issue has carried forward to the new phone. The issue clearly has something to do with my Samsung Health account."
Used to love this because I could easily link my Samsung watch with my virgin pulse app for work. That is no longer the case I keep getting an error that I need to give step permissions to the other app but when all permissions is clicked the problem is still there. Not sure how the issue was resolved but everything is syncing fine currently.
"It was 5 stars until the lastest update. Removing the ability to see the rolling averages (week, month, year), especially for weight and blood pressure, make this app far less useful for me. My doctor is not interested in single day blood pressure readings but is very interested in the weekly and monthly averages. Why we're these eliminated?"
"Why do I have to sign into the app with an ID and password forgotten years ago when upgrading. Should pick up data from existing install how do I go back to the previous version. Feel conned Edited Should have looked at all the negative feedback dealing with the need for a Samsung account, not highlighted in the upgrade info. Yes a con, stick with the previous version or go elsewhere"
"It's good if you want to keep track of heart rate, steps, and your weight. The food tracker is pointless on this and doesn't have many foods nutrition information. The challenges for walking 200,000 steps in a month is fun, but you have to deal with cheaters every month.. I don't understand how someone can do over 600,000 steps on day 1 of the challenge. It doesn't track steps correctly and counts if you are driving slow or riding on a lawn mower."
"I've been using Samsung Health since 2016 and I have always used it and raved about it. Since the last update, it is very glitchy and on a number of days it has failed to record the majority of my steps, which is really disappointing. Tonight I downloaded a new app for step counting and I think I will be relying on that from now on. Very disappointed."
"Recently, I discovered that the app is unable to plot the graph (awake, REM, light, deep sleep) if you have multiple sleep in a night. It works if you sleep through, if you got up for a while and resume sleeping, no graph will be shown. It used to work beautifully even recording naps during the day. Is it a bug? Thanks to Samsung for the prompt email response. A new update of the app has solved the issue. Case closed."
"Nice overall, but bad for tracking nutrients. The website that Samsung uses to log food has many listings that are completely inaccurate: No vitamin C in some listings of orange juice, no potassium in some listings of vegetables, no calcium in listings of some milks, the list goes on. You can add info in manually, but it would be easier to use a different service or scan the label somehow."
"The removal of the weight management function on the app makes this utterly useless. So many people (just read the reviews) used this to help better their lives with the weight management feature, and now they've taken that away. I searched for an older version APK file and refuse to download the update because I have lost 40lbs so far using the app."
"I upgraded to the Note 10+. I knew the HP jack was gone, which almost prevented me from upgrading, but I saw it as an inevitability and, being a Galaxy phone owner since S3, went for it. But man, I didn't properly research, cause there's no heart rate sensor, either. I used the HR sensor frequently, dating back to its debut with the S5, IIRC. If Samsung keeps this up, removing features (HP jack, HR sensor, IR remote, etc.), they're going to lose my business. Smh... Already eyeing Pixel phones."
Okay so now I tested it myself. Seems this app stops or stalls counting when changing directions. It is literally only counting 1/10th of my steps. I just walked back and forth for 3 hours in a 12ft area at working moving stuff around and it only counted 234 steps. THREE HOURS AND ONLY 234 STEPS. I was having fun challenging my family with this but I can't when it is completely inaccurate.
"was working great and tonight when I tried to open the app, I got an error message that said ""cannot open app. unauthorized changes made to your phone. contact customer service for more information"" with a long error number. I tried updating and then deleting and reinstalling the app with no luck. please advise."
"No longer supports syncing with other apps, so it will not track steps from my fossil smartwatch (which is not a supported device, nor can I download the samsung watch app on my watch). Used to love this, but I've switched to myfitnesspal which is a shame because this app is so much prettier and easier to use."
Love this app for sleep and fitness training. Definitely motivates me to work out. My only suggestion is to add the ability to record multiple sleep sessions manually per day. Would be good to know when your sleep is interrupted. And maybe add ability to add notes to the sleep portion.
"Additional review of new update... In addition to taking away weight management, the walking map is broken. I walked a 1.7 mile loop yesterday, and the map has a straight line from my house down 2 houses. It registers the write mileage, but the map is garbage. Test your updates before ruining our experience."
"Much better now you can see break down if macronutrients. The app gives loads if details about a lot of different aspects like sleep, which is great. Especially after workouts. Loads of stats. Can I ask though.. why is there no bar code scanner? This would make logging food a lot easier. Also.. is there anyway we can see more information about the food we eat? Like sugar intake for example? And more information about vitamins and minerals? On the whole a great free app. Really do enjoy it."
"What's happened to this app? It used to be great. Now an awful heart shape with lines has appeared instead of a graph of minutes exercised, the weekly summary has disappeared, and I can't record my weight etc. Also I tried to record my swimming minutes but it wouldn't take the end time. Why has someone changed this for the worse?"
I keep losing steps on my brand new Galaxy watch. I keep rebooting it and sometimes that helps. UT sometimes not. Trying the turn off elliptical and rowing exercise detection and seeing if that will help. Very disappointing. 90% of the reason for the app and watch...
"The step tracker will not pick up my Galaxy Watch data, though it does reflect my sleep data. It shows syncing with the watch but continues to show my old Gear Fit (which I don't have anymore) as step source. I do like the recent interface improvements."
"Don't know why but since the last update, Samsung Health & Samsung Health monitor don't appear to be speaking to each other! I now have to manually input my BP readings to Samsung Health or nothing is recorded! Was a good app prior to the last update! Follow up! The issue was created within the Health Monitor App. Data permission had been reset during last update. Allowing access fixed the issue & now I get my bp readings automatically."
The app will not allow me to manually put in my sleep hours. It allows me to adjust yet when I save it says it's already been recorded. Tried repeatedly with same results. This is disappointing since the data is incorrect most nights. Thanks
"Sign in experience has been bad so far. I cannot paste my password because the app doesn't allow me to. Then if the email address is wrong, the password gets deleted and I have to try again. Update: next problem is that the app won't sign me in and gives me an infinite loading screen."
"Stop saying these changes ""will enhance the experience"" it obviously doesn't you've stuffed up admit it and allow the app to work the way the punters want. Anyway it's a pointless exercise as the Samsung 20+ will not allow you to record pulse and Sats which was the main reason I've used it for over 3 yrs."
"Ad header at the top of the app takes up way too much space. More distracting than a typical ""free"" app would have. Considering this is a stock app on Samsung it's even worse that something like that is even included. *Edit after response* Trying to pass off advertisements as a feature is an insult to your customers. If you want to make it ""Feature-Rich"" as possible include a feature to turn the header off."
"Crashes After the last Google maps update in mid April the app began crashing every time I start to track an activity that displays a map. The error is arrayIndexOutofBounds for the Android maps package Samsung is trying to access. Reinstall fix but now the app is slow to respond to I put, switching to another app."
I just updated the app on my phone and I really do not care for the new sleep graph. Would love to have the old one back. I am also having more problems with the sleep app not recording the entire night. Those two things aside I use the app all the time.
"Ever since the last update, the app's ability to record sleep has been completely broken. Update: I appreciate the phone number but I'm well aware of how to troubleshoot an application and don't really need someone to walk me through it. I've already tried to troubleshoot the application and it has not fixed the issue."
4/12/21: a new version update now requires settings changes allowing the app to make calls. I will not allow this thus I can no longer use the app. I recommend not updating the app as it seems that updates are buggy and change good features. Very frustrating. 2/1/21: update- New version lets me now get into the app. However it will not sync with gear app which is connected. Back to where I started when app 1st updated.
"I like this app and used the small step tracker widget, but it's updated and now doesn't have the previous widget option for steps with a transparent background, and is a large 4√ó1 bar instead of different available size selections. I prefer 1x1. I want the old widget size/background selections available again please. Why change a good thing?! This app just keeps getting worse."
"Good for step counts. Would be better if all functions were available for all phones as there is functions that I can't use. Also, it would be good if it showed you where you have walked on a map, then you could choose to share or not."
"Over time , this app has become a monster that keep gulping your private data . I purchased my Samsung phone paying a hefty price tag and this app is pre - installed. Under the circumstances it is not expected from a company of Samsung stature to snooze on my data like cheap apps that are available for free. Latest update requires access to my phone calls, contacts etc .. otherwise it doesn't function. WE DON'T NEED YOUR SO CALLED 'BETTER OVERALL SERVICE EXPERIENCE' AT THE COST OF OUR PRIVACY."
"Users have been very vocal about not wanting to be forced to share contacts or phone permissions to use the Samsung Health app. I am not interested in the ""optimal experience"" of a ""together feature"". Users who opt in to use this feature can grant permission to their contacts and phone, but those permissions should not be a default requirement of the app. I am stunned and very disappointed that Samsung is completely dismissing their users views. This was a 5-star app I now do not use. üò†"
Can you please add the function of going back days? Like on fitbit app you can see a total review of the day before on 1 window. I really miss this function. Now its so annoying to open up every function and look up everything seperate.. Might go back to fitbit if the samung health app does not improve.
"Used to love this app, but most of the features I liked are gone and the ones that remain do not work. The oxygen meter was actually a selling point over my past couple cellphones, but I've found it only works when it wants. Which, makes my phone a giant paperweight lol. I'll get a J7 next time and save myself $900."
"Glad you guys can make a folding phone for $2000. How much to make the health app work again? It has been almost a half a year and still no fix to the bug many of us are having. The November 2018 update killed my Samsung Health. It gives me a message saying it cannot open on a rooted phone. I didnt root my phone. Thanks, Samsung for ruining one of my most used apps/services and also thanks for the imcompetent service people that don't know what is going."
"I am not a fan of the new format of the food tracker; Gone are multiple snack times ad instead you are forced to record all snacks at one time. The food search itself could also be a bit more user friendly. When searching four ""chicken pasta"" or ""pasta with chicken"", I get a whole host of pasta salads but cannot find any form of chicken pasta."
"I hate the most recent update to this app. After years of being able to track averages month by month and week by week which I used to enourage myself to be consistent in my activity across weeks and months, the data is no longer set up that way. Ill be looking for a different pedometer app going forward. As the main function of this one (comparing data over time) is now non existent. You can no longer check the indivdual averages by month or week."
I am very disappointed in Samsung Health on my Note 10 plus. No longer does it have stress and O2 levels UNLESS I GO BUY A NEW FREAKING WATCH!!! (O2 is important to me because I have Alpha-1) and I absolutely HATE the way they display sleep. So much more difficult to see the sleep pattern without the solid bar graph. Ugh. HATE this now!
No way to clear notifications from notification bar. Only way is to block notifications completely. So intrusive and annoying. Why can't I receive notifications that are clearable? Why is it all or nothing? Why can't Samsung make apps useful without being this way? That's why virtually every single person on the planet despises Bixby.
"I like this app so much, it's very informative and keeps a good track of your cycles when you have a galaxy watch... However it interferes with my Freestyle Libre sensor, I have no idea why Samsung Health uses NFC but it would be good if you could fix this bug as I know I'm not the only diabetic with this issue."
"Awful This app is awful and what bugs me the most is that I bought the Galaxy Watch 3 to take advantage of the health features offered by the watch, which is pointless given how bad the app is. As noted by several other users of the app, removal of the weight management is a huge issue. To offset this, I synched my steps etc. with my fitness pal, but that stopped working. Based on the canned responses, samsung has no intention improving the app."
I used to like this app alot but then they started removing features. I was fine with most of them then they decided that it would be a great idea to remove the constant heart rate graph. What's the point of me having on constant heart rate on my watch if I can't view the graph? This is completely and utterly bad design to remove it. I would give it 0 stars if I could because of this.
"Since the last update, the app no longer provides the option to track floors/stairs. Because the Samsung Gear watch measures stairs climbed, the ability to view floors climbed should be included as a core feature in your software. Am I missing something or did you actually remove a core feature ??"
"I used the app for many years. I needed just a step counter and some statistics. Not so much. After the upgrade, the app stopped working. It requires weird permissions like access to Contacts or Phone. Really? Do you need my Contacts to count steps? I am very disappointed. Now I have to look for a replacement."
"Consistent irritating issues with this App, this week it's not recording my exercise history, last week it was?? Reinstalled the App numerous times & this hasn't worked this time. This App is very inconsistent, had to go to the Samsung store last time to get it to work & they were very helpful but took half an hour. Can't compare to other Health Apps but no other App I use has these problems."
"Over all is good, but the sleep traking details dont sinc sometimes, I can see them in my watch, but not on the phone recorded. Can't personalize my step length for treadmill running, so my run distance is always 30% less than it should be. And the calorie burn is calculated by distance when you run.... So it's also 30% less than it should be. Pliz fix this and the app will be a solid 4... The app receives very little updates.... Just as the watch. This I don't like from Samsung."
"I like the app and i used it a lot especially for tracking my run. It has a lot of feature that very useful to me. The split for the duration and pace was just very"" useful, and i would love if there's the split for the heart rate every km or laps"
"not a bad app for tracking everything. the only downside is for the step count to work I have to keep the app open at all times which kills my battery life, the app doesn't just run in the background counting steps, its also.annoying that it only has uk brands on it when I live in.south Africa and I cant find a way to get sa brands added other than doing each item.manually. sorry cant call international numbers as they are way.to expensive"
"Second review. This app blows, no overall weight lifting option. You have to keep changing exercises, and it dont have all the ones I do. Calorie count is off. Even more so if I try using a third party tracking app. Might be the samsung watch but I'm seriously considering going back to fitbit or Garmin."
"From 1 star to 5! What an incredible improvement! Thank you so much Samsung for removing the trashy adds in this app! No more ugly and distasteful banner adds! And as tracking metrics this app has become so powerful and useful I have stoped using Fit, Sleep, and am about to drop Cardiogram too. Just don't need them anymore. Proper dark mode too for all the Ultra's out there rocking a super AMOLED display. KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK SAMSUNG"
"So far the app is great. It helps me keep track of my calorie intake and how to balance it with exercise. My only complaint is that is doesnt show how much sugar and carbs I've eaten in a day. It will record protein, Vitamins, and others, but not the two most important aspects to losing weight. I know they can do that because if they know the calories and other information in something like a cliff bar or Honey Bun, then surely they can tell me how much of that unhealthy stuff I've had."
"There is a problem with steps counter, sometimes it's stop tracking my steps for a while( 3 hours or more) i keep refreshed the app and open it many times but nothing changes.It's just stops counting, And oxygen saturation taking so long to measure.. when I was infected with COVID-19 i kept measure my oxygen saturation 3 times daily and it wasn't take that long as now! This happened just when I update the app to the last version. Please fix it"
"I have a notification for my steps that I can't swipe away. I don't want to pause my steps being recorded, but I don't want this notification in my phone all day. I'm not even walking, I'm watching tv and it keep popping up. The only way to make it stop is to disable the notifications for this app completely. If it isn't fixed soon, I'll be deleting the app and finding one that's more friendly when I'm not using it."
Clearing the cache did not help. It is still crashing when searching for food. App is crashing when I try to search for biscuits and gravy on adding a meal. Latest update in January of 2021 took away the ability to see history for weight tracking. WHY? Took 3 stars from my rating in return.... And don't leave a comment telling me to contact your customer service. What will some person on the phone do to bring back the weight history tracking?
"They removed the weight control feature that used to calculate your calorie surplus or deficiet for the day. This removed the the most useful feature of the app. The reply below is a canned response and means nothing. Also I would like an explanation as to why you recomend keeping the app updated for the ""updated features"" when your updates remove useful features and add no new features or content. One star."
"I got a Samsung Active watch for Christmas and I haven't been able to use most of the features because of this app. Every time I try to sign up, I get a message that says the app isn't working and to try again later. It's been like this for weeks. It makes the watch pretty useless. I contacted Samsung customer service after trying to fix the problem and was told to go through online customer service. Bot refused to connect me to a person and told me I need to send my phone in. Waste of money."
"Recent update removed ability to import data for my exercise activities. This is shortsighted, and done on purpose. Many Galaxy owners have competing sports watches, and will never get a Samsung one. We've all now been locked out of the main health app on our phone. I've used S Health for years. No longer, & not by my choice."
Since I use a Galaxy watch I use this app. For the most part it is pretty robust. My main issue is often syncing with other app such as Strava that was once easy and the most frustrating part is the tracking when withing out on machines such as the elliptical/treadmill. When using the elliptical or treadmill I use the stationary handles and the app just stops tracking altogether without asking me if I stopped working out. I wish Samsung would put in a prompt so that my activity is more accurate.
"I went from a Fitbit and Loseit to all Samsung, and I'm impressed - I highly recommend it."
Unable to log in. Asking for two step verification tried it multiple times and doesn't work. Cleared cache and data and still doesn't work. When I cleared data it reset app permissions. Why do I need to give samsung healthnpermissopm to use my number to make calls? Anyway app wouldn't go further if I declined so accepted and falls down at the two step verification. Have updated App.as well and still same issue.
"Before I've left my house it says I've done 563 steps it's never accurate then it's always stopping and I update it and afew days later it freezes again. But when the step counter isn't accurate it effects my mental achievements,I've used Samsung health for years but it's not working properly.id always give 5 stars b8t not unless it's fixed,the s8 I'm on has a heart rate monitor which is always inaccurate."
"Stress measurement wrong after update -Edit to reply: Actually it's pretty simple, used to work, now doesn't. Sample: If I'm just about 15min awake I get a way down green stress result (logical). After about half an hour it is over half the bar on a relaxed day off. About 1hr after waking up it's maxed out red (on a relaxed day off or busy day at the job), worked just great 2 versions ago, normally levels differ during the day but not all or nothing, it's is no longer giving the right results after v6.1.1.001 as many others mentioned too. 5 to 4* after the previous update -- Edit2: After latest update, the (stress) miscalculations + all 0 (zeros) in recommended food intake values (also since previous update) are still not fixed.. Also, unfriendly notify voice since 2 updates. Back to 2*. -- Edit3: Went back to v6.1.1.001 now due to excessive battery usage (on sensor calls) (S6 Nougat). Works flawlessly now (as it should with updates too). No need to contact because above says it all. I won't update the app anymore. Too bad, really liked it, just like this old version works now, therefor still 2*"
"A) it would nice to be able to name your workouts. For example, there is no option to log a crossfit workout so I use the generic workout for it. Thats fine but especially for the generic workout we should be able to rename it to whatever we want. B) For some reason generic workout will transfer to MFP but my walking won't. I don't understand why since they are logged the same exact way. It's just not the most useful app."
"With the latest Aug 05 2020 update you have taken off the calorie balancer plus caffeine tracker. Now for January 2021 you removed additional tracking features from meals plus the ability to see average weights. Why is this? Keep this up and eventually I'll have to switch to something else. Are you planning on discontinuing this app say it in advance, there are plenty fitness apps in the store. And no, I'm not updating, I rolled back to the older version that still has it."
"Used the app mostly for tracking bike rides. Up until the update, it would have a detailed map of the route, including weather, wind, and other info. After the update, it recorded that I rode for an hour and 20 minutes, but the route showed .14 miles. Not a big fan of the update Samsung."
"It was 5*, then you removed the weight management feature, which was an idiotic move that made your app useless. I've been a Samsung person since the Galaxy S3. I cannot believe you guys would make such a terrible, anti-user, moronic choice. STOP removing features and work on improving/adding features. O2, BP, etc are all things my watch CAN do, but you aren't doing anything about. I'll gladly re-rate if you guys get it together and reverse course."
This my favorite fitness app and I actually think the new redesign looks nice. However after updating it lost the ability to connect to other trackers like fitbit and misfit. Unless I am missing the option somewhere I am really disappointed I can't track my sleep using my misfit anymore :(
"Great until the last update required my contacts and ability to make calls. WTH? I've stopped using it & will delete unless they drop those requirements. Their response to other users who feel as I do is that those permissions are needed to install the update & for optimal ""user experience "". If Samsung needs access to -- or the ability to call -- my kids in order to update software, what they really need is better coders."
Missing so much! Your app isn't compatible with alot of other apps such as Cronometer which is disappointing. I also have mentioned before that a barcode scanner for food and drink its vital! Your the only app that I have used that STILL doesn't . On the plus side I Thank you soooo much for added the period tracker for women!!
"This app is ok but a lot of the foods and/or nutritional facts can't be found. You basically have to enter everything manually. I believe that a barcode scanner which automatically uploads the foods nutritional values would be of such great help. Any plans of adding that function to this app soon? This would be very helpful & make this app 10 times better, faster & easier to use. Hey if the MyFitnessPal app has it, why can't Samsung Health??"
"I liked FITBIT app better. Take a look at their app and try to work in some if their screen displays, methods of capturing data to make Samsung Health better. Also, on MyFitness Pal, steps are not syncronizing like fitbit would, ie ability to account more callories a mb d nutrients for steps taken. Please update your app."
"I've been using this App for years and even with the updated version it's NEVER disappointed me! I track my steps, water consumption, and sleep habits with no problem! I like the fact that I can challenge my coworker to drink more water and be more active! Looking forward to linking it up to a smart watch soon! I also got a few of my students to use the app also and they ask me everyday how many steps I've taken, which encourages ME to do more walking! AWESOME app overall!"
Problems with compulsory 2way verification. Promising blood pressure monitoring and other features already long time but still not available for non samsung phones. There is definitely much better options than samsung products available. It is like apple trying to make you buy same products. If you have samsung watch and non Samsung phone some features are not available. And probably will not in the future. Aviid it. Samsung confirms it will be not available for non samsung phones
"I have some queries which i am facing while using this app and they should be resolved: 1.    While using and measuring my heart rate, Spo2 and stress level the sensor of my note 8 is remained on and every time it blinks either any thing else touch the sensor. 2.    While measuring stress level and spo2 the app shutdowns automatically. 3.    The sensor is not working properly and didn't sense the walking and running activity, while the other apps like google fit app."
"Takes a while to figure it out and adjust it to your weight and activity for your goal but once you do it's pretty good. The weight management is confusing at first but again it takes time to figure it out. The only thing that never worked on this app was adding Breakfast, Lunch or Dinner from your galaxy watch. You can add food but it will show up the NEXT day not your current day....for me it's frustrating but overall 4/5."
I was enjoying it but they're slowly eliminating functionality. I switched to use it exclusively once I got a galaxy watch but them eliminating weight management makes it much less useful. I'll probably switch back to the MapMy apps because they're a better experience now that S Health removed weight management.
":( I love walking, and I love that this app records how much you walk without you needing to start a timer BUT it will randomly delete your steps at midnight if you dont update manually, AND it doesn't mention if it needs to be updated. I'm very unimpressed with this. At least if you could manually correct the error then fine, some mistakes can be made but you can't so now everytime I open the app it just sits there mocking me and my deleted progress."
"Why does samsung health need a SIM card in my phone?! Could not install it as I do not use a SIM card in principle in smart phones. Edit: It's okay, I took a friend's SIM for 5 min.. Sigh, I do use only wifi as a way of interacting with the app's database. One or even 1.5 stars off due to the app having big problems connecting to mi fit/Google fit/lifesum, without them it feels disconnected from my data too much. (And lifesum has a better food nutrition support for food products from Russia.)"
You can't create custom interval training (neither running nor swimming). Even 10 years old Tomtom watches with no longer supported app can do that. There is no way how to connect SH with the apps able to create custom workouts like Adidas Runtastic or so. Running programs are only up to 10k (half marathon or marathon would be great addition). Speaking of sport tracker it is nowhere near as good as Garmin's Connect app.
"App no longer works or is of use to me. It was by far the best app for monitoring your weight, calorie intake, setting your goals and monitoring where you were at with them. Since the last update, it's been terrible, doesn't do what it used to do."
"What's the point of the app without the weight management feature??? I switched from a Fitbit to a Samsung watch, without realizing the main feature I wanted was removed from the app earlier this year. I love my watch but I'm now regretting my decision because of this horrible app. Bring back the weight management feature ASAP and add a barcode scanner..."
"Overall ok, could use some improvements. I recently switched from a Fitbit Versa to a Galaxy Watch 4. I also switched from using MyfitnessPal to Samsung Health. The food logging part of the app could use a phone feature to scan UPC barcodes. This would make logging foods much easier. Also it requires very specific strings when enter food. For example, it might not find ""Chocolate Chip Clif Bar"", but will find ""Clif Bar Chocolate Chip"". I also turned off the workout auto detect false d..."
"Was a great app. Now 1/3 of the screen is covered with ads. The phone was $900 and now I have to be bombarded with ads in native apps? No way to disable them even though there are toggles which don't work. A real scam considering that the Samsung watch works exclusively with this app too. In spite of their response below, I'm literally looking at a continuous scroll of nine Samsung ads. The app also says, ""contains ads"" soooo. Solution? Install Google fit and Health Sync. Hey no more ads."
The app will not let me add food to track calories without putting it in manually. I used to use the function constantly but now it's too hard to track and research how much everything on my own. I used it because it was accessible and easy and now it's disappointing
"I used to like this app but after the update it's demoted itself to be just a steps tracker. I can't record any other informations, nothing saves. First: sleep recording, then everything else. Only steps tracking and, what funnier, the coffee control. Sadly, it seems like I have to use a few different apps to maintain everything that this app was enough for before the update."
I'll find a different app that doesn't want access to manage my phone calls. In other comments you say for a better experience.. what a load of garbage. If I wanted my apps to have access to everything I'd get an iphone. Going to be looking into a plus one for my next phone if the Samsung apps start getting more intrusive.
"This app WAS absolutely perfect before it updated. I like the new update because it combines both lifestyle balance and weight management, when they used to be separate which frustrated me. HOWEVER, I gave only 1 star because of one MASSIVE problem! it crashes for no particular reason at all! 1: I keep checking to see if it needs another update, but there isn't any. 2: I try making sure it's the ONLY app running at the time I need it. 3: I try taking my phone out of the protector to let it cool down in case it's overheating and I just don't know it. 4: I've cleared the cache! APPARENTLY IT'S NONE OF THAT! It WAS working just fine until it started crashing shortly before the update; the moment I installed their partner app, Quealth, to be exact. I HAVE TO keep using this app, because my doctors WANT me to, so SOMEBODY PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE FIX IT!!!"
I really want to like this app but it keeps pausing while doing workouts. Then I have to stop my workouts to resume. I followed Samsung's advice on how to fix the app and within a few days it pauses my workout session and I have to stop workout to hit resume botton. Finally uninstalled the app and found another app that works.
"This app used to be awesome. Having so many sync issues, I've had this app for over a year and have never had these issues. I tried the chat on Samsung support and get that that is not available. I don't have the time to wait on the phone for someone to help me troubleshoot."
"I just use this as a step counter on my phone. I dont like the tone of language of the new update. When i picked up my phone at 3 this morning i was greeted with 'why not go for a walk', my phone was more likely to be thrown down the stairs. Words of encouragement are fine but need to be timed more appropriately. I liked the old wording much better. Please spring into action and fix it. Thanks"
"Why did it stop synchronising with my Samsung Watch 3? It was working till 19.04 and now it says it is synchronising but it doesn't get any info from the watch. I did 19000 steps yesterday according to my watch, but after a synchronisation Samsung Health shows only 2000 (considering that I had also my phone with me, I don't understand why the phone didn't count steps, but that's another problem). Anyway, what happened in the last update that is stopped synchronising? It doesn't copy anything!"
"A fantastic app that has really helped me with losing weight and attaining health goals. Lots of great features however, the food log could use some refining to make calorie counting better. All in all tho, really nice app, easy to use and customize to whats important for your goals."
It's stopped working. Possibly it isn't compatible with my latest android update
App is broken with latest update. Can't set up the 2 factor authentication and can't get around it without the app crashing. Edited to say that the verify button to enter the code I receive to my mobile is not clickable. The app is completely unusable in its current version.
"What happened to the weight management calorie tracker?! I've used this app to help guide me to loosing 70 pounds last year and to keep it off. Just got my mom and brother into using it to get them on a healthy track. Now the main part of the health app is gone. We want the weight management calorie tracker back, PLEASE! Also while we're here, add an option where you can add if you're walking/ running with weights."
"12Mar22. Picked the Galaxy watch 4 with BT. Did not think the LTE version makes sense given the battery life. Compared to other devices like fitbut the battery life is very poor. Hardly 2 days , thus developing range anxiety like in Electric vehicles. Also there is no prompt or reminders. Only reason I bought it was its Samsung. OLDER update„ÄãGood app, when paired with Samsung watch. Keeps me motivated to keep on. Love it. Only downside is watch battery life is only a day and half."
I bought a Galaxy Fit e earlier this year for the sake of tracking and syncing seamlessly with Samsung Health but the battery became faulty after a few months. The app is basically useless unless you have your phone attached to you most of the time or you own a samsung tracker. Hoping that 3rd party trackers will be allowed again sometime soon.
"I used to LOVE the app. Used it daily but since the new policy update, it won't open past the ""continue"" screen. I don't want to reload the app or clear data as I have years worth of weight, steps, heart rate, etc that I would lose! Hope they get this fixed soon or I will be looking for another app!"
"I use the app for challenges, it motivates me to challenge people all over the world, but since the update it hasn't been working right, numerous times I have reached the target FIRST and the challenge doesn't stop it keeps going until someone else reached it, very frustrating!!"
"having the same problems as others... says cannot open on rooted phone. didnt have any problems two weeks ago. very upsetting since I loved using it before and didnt have problems connecting with my smart watch. followed all the steps to ""fix"" problem with no results."
I hadn't had any problems with the app prior to today. I cannot get past the two step verification screen so I can't even use the app. Tried uninstalling and redownloading....nothing. When will this be fixed?? Thanks for the reply person from Samsung but i have tried to do all of what you listed and nothing is working. Please help!
"It's a great app. I've been using it with my galaxies for a long time. The problem now is my current device has stopped counting steps. Other apps work fine but I've done everything to try and fix it with no solution. I've contacted samsung with no help, erased cach√©, wiped partition, Uninstall and reinstalled, factory reset the phone twice, created a new samsung account. Still nothing . It works on other devices. But not this one that's still working fine. I'm looking for alternatives now, 2bad"
Not the same as it once was. Having the note 10 + it isn't the same experience with the stress and heart rate. Much prefer apple products for this feature. Having a gear active with the phone still doesn't give understandable hourly readings.
"Update 25 Jan 2022-phone updated to UI4 yesterday. Phone no longer recognizes or connects to the watch or health app. All data from the app has been lost. I am beyond furious. Since the 1/12 update I can't see history. This is unacceptable. Also, this app does not count stairs climbed. If it can't detect this why does it pretend it can? The worst is not being able to access history."
"Love this app, mostly to share my walking stats and route with my best friend, but since I bought a new Samsung phone the GPS does not accurately track my movements like the app on my last Samsung phone did, that is disappointing. I have all the proper permissions on, would like to have this fixed. I have been a Samsung user and fan for years, this is disappointing."
"Nice app but when used in combination with samsung watch, it overcounts steps by up to 15% as checked with external pedometer. I really wish you would give us an advanced setting where we can calibrate the stepcount by a factor of our choice. You could even integrate the calibration mode in samsung health app, as it basically is an external pedometer in its own right. Just test over a 3 day period and enter a correction factor for the watch count."
"Rated 2 star for this particular concern. Previous version had a quick reference gauge for calories intake versus calories burned... Can't understand why this feature would even be considered to be removed... Suggestion Bring it back as a dashboard option. Update. To Samsung I didn't rate you 4 stars. Factly I keep knocking you down. Lost the calorie intake vs calorie burned Guage. And now your app consistently stop tracking while I'm running. I'm looking for another, better app."
"I would really like samsung health to up their game now. Would like to see insights on 1. Stationary time, what's my average stationary time 2. Good sleep tracking. Sleeping heart rate. 3. There is trends on heartrate but there is no consolidated data points on my entire history. My galaxy watch S3 has the ability to track all of it but software is a let down"
New update changed the colors on the food nutrition..... so why did you make them look soo similar. The carb and fat color are both green and the protein color is like a tan. Who thought this was a good idea. It's especially bad on dark mode!! Match apple's capabilities - Add hearing loss detection - if the phone detects that youre in a loud area for a long time you should get a notification. Add a health card
Don't buy Samsung. Samsung support does nothing to help you. One part of the UI is in russian and another part is in english. The app doesn't find food when you search it in russian language. And it doesn't synchronize with featured app for calories counting. The support is still quiet. And it gets me irritated. I really regret that I have bought so many Samsung devices.
"I like the app quite a lot. my only issue is with the monthly challenges. The first day of the month people are getting 200,000 to 400,000 steps in which is around a 100 to 200 miles. In one day. Its impossible. If you could somehow curb the obvious cheaters, I think it would give people more insensitive to join the challenges."
"Until yesterday this app was great. I used it to track my blood sugars to show my doctor at my check up's, but they've changed the way you access your information, and you can no longer see a drop down list of all the blood draws you've take for the month you can only see they day by day. So, a little frustrating."
I wish this offered more widgets that were customizable. There are so many features in the app and the only widget option is the step counter and it doesn't even let you change the size. Other than that this app is great for all your health tracking needs.
Been using this app for a few years now. As other users pointed out that features were reduced such as not being able to see the week or monthly view of weight change I could put up with this. The final straw was locking me out of the app without giving phone permissions. I've uninstalled the app and looking for other options now. I hate that all these apps try to take over and invade every aspect of our devices.
"Been using this app for a long time now and loved the daily insights, especially my daily step rating comparison, which have been great motivators giving me real time progress but since the last update I don't get any daily insights. I track sleep, steps, activity, weight, etc. What has changed? Otherwise it has been a great app for tracking my exercise and diet and motivating me since my heart attack. Also provides great data for my health professionals."
"Good features, odd navigation. There are many features built in this app, so I don't have to use alternative apps for them as I have been this whole time. However I've found it very awkward to navigate and find the things I'm looking for."
"Some features are good and correct. Very difficult to verify the stress level, but totally rubbish the ""Sleep"" function. How on earth can they deploy that function at that inaccurate level. That should be the easiest one. Gave 4 , hopping they will improve."
"Really annoyed that the continuous heart rate graph was removed. I need to see this graph for a health condition I'm monitoring. Now they took it away? Incredibly annoying. I either need to find a new app now, or keep downloading an older version of the app."
"Hi, can you please add more features to the women's health tracker? I have been using it while trying to get pregnant and it has been very helpful but now it it is stuck on showing ""period missed by x days"" as I have now become pregnant and there is no option to input this.(changing my review to 2 stars because they still have not updated this feature 2 months after mentioning it)"
"I really liked the app so far, but I just got the notice, that the weight and calorie tracking features will be remove in the next update. I have recently used those features to help me keep on track with losing those ""Corona""-pounds and it worked great for me. Why will it be removed? It can't be that expensive to keep that feature. It makes me feel like this is another case of ""baiting the people and when we hooked them we will remove features bit-by-bit because we have the power to do so and there is nothing you can do about it and if you want it back you will have to buy something else now"". I have experienced this so often in the past. What will you remove next? Samsung, I thought better of you!"
"This App is utter genius. For general health & exercise, you cant do better, its all in one you dont really need any the other plug in app, the fitness & mindfulness additions are just getting better... Only gripe i have is that the inline skating app wrongly records (too little!) calories -( its better to use the cycling app!) & on the WATCH 2 theres no inline skating workout ! Otherwise fantastically brilliant piece of work"
"Update took away trends for weight management and other categories which were previously excellent. Totally useless now. Without trends is impossible to make progress. Am astonishment that developers of this app don't understand this. Also, it now shows a GIANT ad across the top of app homescreen which is just nonsense."
"Where the heck are my workouts! For the 3rd day in a row I've completely lost workouts due to the watch monitor stopping on its own. I'm soooo frustrated! I've done a rowing machine for 110 minutes...stopped clocking at 30 minutes and logged all of that as steps, even though rowing machine was selected. Next, my daily 1 hour HIIT training, has to be logged as circuit or other... neither of which truly reflect the workout stopped logging at 10 minutes. The latest upgrade is HORRIBLE!"
"Until i switched from a Samsung S8 to a OnePlus 8, everything was really good. Now i cant sign into my account on my new phone so that my watch can pair properly and i can track my workouts and overall health. Im stuck at a loading screen. And its said that this app is usable on all devices, not just samsung devices.... Reply: I live in the UK and cant call long distance."
"App randomly ""updates"" while I'm using my phone causing all other apps to restart. It informs me I'm exercising when I'm driving my truck but doesn't record till halfway through an actual walk. The women's health is very confusing and will tell me my period is late all month even though I recorded my period when it happened. The only thing that sort of works is the sleep record with my watch."
"After update the App, it no longer allowed sync with third party apps such as AIA Vitality. There is an option to allow to sync with S health, but no other options such as step counts etc. Once you de-link the third party app, you no longer able to link it back. There is an error message that permission is not granted."
"Calorie counter broke unable to keep track of progress anymore. Tried resetting and clearing cache but nothing has worked to ammend the new incorrect counter, because it's synced to my other apps it's reflecting poorly on them too. How can I fix this?"
Weight Management Tile is gone! What a unproductive decision? Made a perfect app a brain dead donkey version. Don't like the new interface not showing calorie total in a circular gage. Now no indication of calorie deficit or excess summary shown. Why did you remove it? Also colours used for carb fat and protein its to greenish and hard to distinguish.
This app was great but now it doesnt even count my steps! Prefer the old screen where it showed the daily and weekly data. Cant change the settings to have it on all the time instead it is 'only when app in use'. Revert it back until all the problems are fixed!
"Doesn't have many of the foods I eat but only allows 100 foods to be added to database; many foods listed are missing nutrients; does not total nutrients correctly; removed O2 saturation feature I used; disappointing/not recommended... UPDATE: This app just crashed my S7 when I tried to enter my dinner. Phone would not shut down, just hung on logo screen. Had to Google a fix. Have now uninstalled Samsung Health."
"App was great until this last update. Kept receiving an error pop-up (saying it wont run on a rooted phone despite the fact that this phone isnt rooted, nor has it ever been) even after I force stopped the app and put it to sleep. Uninstalled. Hopefully this will resolve itself. I have a Samsung watch and it would be a shame if it didnt."
"lacks many features. one very basic i have been trying to get info is about total distance covered. i can get for a day or last seven days...but for a month or between daya...nope. all i get is total steps but, no distance for a month. works only when keep phone with you at all times. does not accepts data from fitness trackers."
"App won't work unless your sign in. You can't access many of the health features of your $400 watch unless you create an account. Well that doesn't work. For me it would not sign in. Just presents a little spinning circle endlessly. I've tried resetting the password, creating a new account, still won't work. Also the developer contact email is ""noreply"" so apparently they don't even want you contacting them to request help. Useless app and no way to contact developer. Considering returning watch. ***EDIT: Developer responded. Tried their fix. Cleared app data and storage and reset phone. Still just get the blue spinny circle. Fix your dang app! Also don't make us sign in since that seems to be the problem. We wouldn't be using the stupid app if we didn't already have your watch, what's the point of forcing a login? The Galaxy Wearable app works fine without a login. ***EDIT 2: Again tried to get the app working. Cleared data and uninstalled. Restarted both phone and watch. Installed again and signed in. Still just get the spinning circle. I can login to my Samsung account fine (just did to download another app). But this one refuses to do anything."
"Need ""pickle ball"" as a trackable exercise. It is huge in America right now. Certainly bigger than ""yahting"""
"I feel this needs more options, like health food suggestions and to track vitamin supplements. When I track my food intake I notice it says I'm missing some vitamins, but I am getting them my supplements, so to be able to put that down would be helpful. Also it tracks our calories intake and activities, so if our activities could subtract our calories intake would be really cool. Another thing I forgot to mention. When I put my meals down the info is not always correct."
"Terrible update. Terrible decision. There is no need for Samsung to require these permissions for a feature no one is going to use. I understand Samsung's response that the Phone permissions are needed for Together to work, but if all these people are uninstalling because of privacy concerns, who will be left to be ""Together"" with? Bad form, Samsung. I used to be a loyal customer. No longer."
i really like this app and most of the recent updates. i absolutely love you partnered with lympo. but my biggest issue however is most of the time for homecooked meals im not entirely sure of the calorie count + nutrition facts so i end up having to make a recipe on another app but then i have to switch between two apps to input information. please just add a feature that intergrates that. i wouldnt mind making the recipe if i didnt have to also redo all the info again onto this app.
"The app was great until the recent update removed the user's right to choose. Privacy is a huge concern and the developers of this app don't seem to care being that they have rubber-stamped the same response to each customer that share this concern. As I navigated the app to set it up after I completed the recent update, the app stated that the permissions were ""optional"" but then it stopped functioning because I refused the phone permission. Seems pretty mandatory to me..false expectations"
The latest update removed the weight management section which was one of the best features. I would have given the app 5 stars with it but only 2 w/o it. I used that feature multiple times during the day to check my calorie consumption vs expenditure. Please bring that key feature back.
"Since 11/2/20 the app has deleted my steps history. The data is recorded, the user can monitor daily steps, but at midnight all data is deleted. Although frustrating, even more frustrating is that I have called Samsung twice. The 1st time I was informed other complaints were received, a fix was imminent - not to worry. When 2 more days of data was deleted, I called again, but was told that there was no glitch, no other complaints registered. Used it for years, but looking for a new app."
"This app doesnt work at all on my Samsung a70 it just says the service is unavailable and to try again later ...I've uninstalled it and reinstalled it and it still doesnt work any ideasü§î (update 07/14) Called this number and they said they couldn't help. He told me I had to fill some online inquiry, the audio was so bad on the other end I couldn't hear anything he was saying."
"Doesn't sync with My Wellness App/ Technogym, it should. A Christmas present now left in the drawer as it does not sync with My Wellness App. I wished I bought a Garmin instead of this. I feel let down as I did my research and it used to sync. Even Press Releases show that it should. Don't waste your money if you're looking for a decent watch. If any Comments are left, please don't leave a US phone number, as I'm in the UK."
"I've used this app on my phone for 2 years. Love(d) it for all the features but mostly tracking my walks. Not sure what happened in the last 3 months but instead announcing my pace after each mile, I'm now told how many calories I've burned. Knowing my pace helps motivate to pick up speed. Yes, I could stop and look at my phone but I don't want to stop."
"Since the update I find the app a bit confusing. I liked the home page layout a lot better before with calorie meter at the top, in plain site. Also, not every food or meal I eat is in there when I search. When I tried to add to ""My Foods"" like I've done plenty of times in the past, I can't! How do I add a food and all of its health details?"
"Data inaccurate when coming from phone + watch. Samsung watch (never been off my wrist since bought two days ago) says 8000 steps. Huawei phone having been in my pocket most of the day says 12000 steps. The app is set to take data from both phone and watch, says 8100 steps. Not understanding the 4000 difference and why the app is pulling random numbers. No solution on line, this seems to be a common issue. Also had login issues, I had to resort to downloading an old version of the app to fix."
"I have use this app for many years and have loved it, until I bought a New S10 it never shows the stress O2 properly, I have a work S8 and another S6 those 2 match 99-100% this new S10 only shows 92-94, doctors office shows 100% When I got this phone I got in touch with T Mobile they blamed it on the app, I believe there is something wrong with the scanner/hardware but provided no solution, thus this is the last time I will purchase a Samsung phone!"
"why is the ""auto-detect workout"" option locked? this is the most annoying f*ing thing. i don't need my watch to alert and say ""great workout!"" when i'm sweeping the floor or just emphatically telling a story. i'm sure there are folks for whom that's helpful, but shouldn't that be a decision the user gets to make, not samsung? jeez, guys. also worth noting that the app persists despite samsung health being blocked from generating notifications. screenshots available on request."
"I would like to be able to use just one app. Right now I have two. This one to keep track of my sleep, water, and exercise all with my band I have. The other is to keep track of my food. See i like to keep track of my calories, carbs, and proteins. Also the other app has a scanner that allows me to scan food instead of having to type it all in. I am in the process of trying to find one app that dose all this but I can't seem to find one. It be awesome if it was this app as I do like this app."
"The recent update made it impossible to open, even if you accepted the terms and conditions, and accepted permissions. Even if it worked, it has been watered down and made barely usable before the most recent update. Why did Samsung effectively kill this service, making my Samsung watch little more than a paperweight?"
"When my old phone died (black screen), I lost all my data. Years of info lost. Update: I did call twice. First time was no help. The second time, when I called back, the woman I spoke with was incredibly helpful. She had me install Samsung Tutor so she could access my phone and help me. At the end of the call, we didn't think we'd been successful. But upon looking into my app a bit, I realized I'd indeed gotten my data back. I hope she can be tracked down to let her know. I'm very thankful!"
It's brilliant but please can we have a Web interface. So hard to see all the stats just using phone. Really miss fitbit as they do. If not at least make it available on a tablet. Come on Samsung you can do better than fitbit.
Everytime there's an update this app gets more useless. Recent update makes it way harder to track macros. First weight management is gone and now they screwed up the food tracking. Can't track macros properly. Can't track calories in/out efficiently. This app is about to get uninstalled.
"Tried to install this app twice and all it does is ask for a login ( and this login account works fine on the Samsung website) and then the app just sits there trying to load. I let it run for 36 hours and and tried the troubles steps with no progress. This is on a new phone with no problems. Your watches and phones are awesome but your app needs considerable improvement as many of your users have expressed. --- Update: I cleared the cache and did reinstall , but it did not fix the problem."
"Best health monitor, really good at telling you your sleep schedule. If you want to track your nutrition, you can do so by scanning the Barre codes on the products you eat and entering the quantity. Very easy to use. Also good to track your pulse and show to your doctor the regular heart pulse that you usually have every day. Also good to keep track of the water amounts you drank per day and can also motivate you to drink more each day!"
"I use this app to manage my weight. I have lost over 40 lb thanks to the weight management function and now its removed?? I specifically bought the Active 2 watch to work with this app. I sync MFP, Google Fit, water hidration etc. Everything flows into SHealth to manage weight and now this important feature was removed without so much as an explanation. If the feature isn't restored I will be removing the app and selling my watch and possibly my S10+ to look for better options. Thanks Samsung."
"Awful update! Put it back the way it was. After the last update, I couldn't login to the app. I've NEVER had to login to the app for as long as I have had my phone. BEFORE the awful recent update, I used it daily. I used the pulse and oxygen levels monitoring multiple times a day because I have a medical condition that requires that. I am deeply disappointed and deleted the app."
"I really like this app. It has a lot of things that are useful to my health situation. The only gripe that I have is I wish it was more compatible with other app such as Wyze, so that I may link it to my scale. One last thing the items that they took away like stairs was disappointing. Other than that we good."
"Overall very good. Sleep monitor inaccurate & not useful in current form as cannot correct sleep start/finish times. Removed it from selection. HR, O2 etc. are great. Could add more features for people with health issues eg blood results (vit D, iron etc.) to help with monitoring long term illnesses"
"I installed this app on my Android phone after recently acquring a Samsung Gear S3 watch. My goal in installing this app was to have a more usable interface for checking on the health statistics monitored by my watch's sensors.  As soon as I installed it, my phone's battery life was noticeably shortened. Checking my power settings, this app was at the top of the battery consumption list. I went into S-Health settings to turn off all the activity monitoring settings, in the hope that this would reduce battery consumption.Unfortunately this app will not allow you to turn off steps counting - the switch is disabled. Samsung please change this -  I don't need both my phone and my watch counting my steps. Anyway, even after turning off all the other activity monitring settings except step counting, this app was still my biggests battery consumer.  Also, the installed size of this app was a whopping 170MB (or maybe 190MB, can't remember exactly). Serious bloatware. I uninstalled this app, and my phone's battery life was noticeably lengthened."
"I haven't managed to get the app' to work yet. I've just bought myself a Samsung Active Watch, which I am happy with so far, but haven't yet been able to get the app' to work on my Moto phone (it meets all the specifications required) so I'm finding this quite frustrating. I've read the other reviews/advice and tried clearing the cache but all I get is a swirling blue and green circle on a white background, no pop up messages, no further progress. Eventually I close it down and try again. Any suggestions for what I need to do to make the app' work welcomed as one of the reasons for buying this watch was to be able to track my fitness using the app'. Thanks."
"It's ok, in theory. For someone who has a disability and who needs to use a walking device it doesn't count steps properly half time. Even if I have it in my pocket. Never counts step if in a bag or purse on my person. Food intake is very specific most of the time where I can't find the food choices where I can't enter food for correct caloric intake. If I have a good day amd can work out, it's great. But for a disabled person, would not recommend."
"have used it for years. this last updated really smells like they are writing out old phones,like my s8. my phone is not rooted. have tried everything I have found to resolve it I think I am done. update: to fix the rooted error they had me clear me phones cache under settings. it started working. well a month later and it is giving me the same error. come on samsung..no calls. fix your app. period."
"Doesnt work on new LG Stylo 6. Uninstalled twice. Cleared cache, cleared daya. No bueno. Update: called number, waste of time if you don't have Samsung phone. I have an LG. Operating system is Android. Shouldn't matter what brand phone. Update. It works! Not exactly sure why. I disconnected bluetooth and miraculously, the app finally opened."
"I have tried using this app to help monitor my activity, especially the distance I walk. I also have a Fitbit which I find very useful. I have found 3 irritating factors with Samsung Health: Unless you are carrying your phone with you it cannot measure your steps and distance covered. Not everyone has their phone glued to them constantly. I would like it to link to my Fitbit, thereby getting a more accurate step Count. It pauses my walking exercise count unless I carry it in my backpocket."
"Very inaccurate. It thinks me shaking my phone in my hand standing still are 'steps'. It might give you a rough idea of how many steps you take, but my guess is unless you don't touch your phone whatsoever while you're walking for however long you're walking it won't be accurate."
"Permissions and privacy agreement are insanely invasive. I have used it for a while and it is a good app, but after reading the user agreement and reviewing the permissions, I believe this could be considered spyware. I have never had to change permissions to agree to EULAs."
"Removed ability to edit sleep times, making this feature of the watch and app essentially useless. Sleep tracking was 95% of my reason for getting the Samsung watch, but since it logs reading and watching TV as sleep, it's grossly inaccurate, and I can't edit it to reflect when I did sleep. Very disappointed."
"The update is ok... but the measurements using the sensor on my phone won't take at all. It looks like it's working, the heart beat lines come up, but I sat for a good 5 mins and all it would say is ""measuring,...measuring,...measuring"" I like the app this one thing needs to be corrected. Everything worked fine before the update."
"I love the app! It does exactly what it's supposed to do. It keeps track of my steps,heart and syncs perfectly. Been using it for 3 yrs and I still love it. The menstruation feature is a little wonky but I just keep track on my calendar no big deal. ‚ù£Ô∏èü•∞"
"It is not the best app around. I think Samsung is stuck with Google on representing trends on exercise, weight, sleep, etc like a trend lines. Look at Apple and way they represent data to inspire and give insights on its watch. Having those ugly hearts is not helping a lot. There is a need for make over with Samsung Health app. Look at Fitbit way to inspire the way they present challenges. Include bar code reading to add food to nutrition. This app is useful but needs sophistication."
"UPDATE: Still having so many connections issues with this app! Makes me want to go back to Fitbit as I had NO issues with their application. Please fix! Still issues with connection to other apps (MyFitnessPal, Renpho nor Asana Rebel apps). And please update the platform as well, can do with a more user-friendly look & feel to it. Thank you"
"I have been using this app for some time now, however, the app has recently ask to gain permission to access make my contact list. I don't think so and I won't agree to it. If Samsung doesn't reverse this permission, they will loose a lot of customers as a result. There are plenty of other apps that can do what Samsung app does, if not better."
Draining too much battery by running in the background always and not able to stop it. It autoruns one way or other and drains too much battery. More than screen time at times. Seems like app is not optimised for Android 10 and have not been updated in a while. Device is Pocof1 with Android 10. Kindly fix this asap.
"Not a fan of the new update. Terrible font, more scrolling and awake progress bar. Will be looking at new health apps if not possible to revert to old design... If this is the future of Samsung Ill be looking for a new phone too üò´ Update: Its still terrible with the new UI. Scrolling for days. Was debating getting the galaxy watch but if this is the UI trend samsung is heading in ill pass."
"When I set up my watch it told me I only needed 1462 cal/day, which I felt was a bit low considering I'm nursing an infant. I feel like they assumed I wanted to loose weight but they have no way to adjust for women who are nursing. The menstruation tab only wanted the date of my last period, which was over a year ago. I'm not working out but I am burning extra calories and require more nutrients. I feel like they care more about weight loss then health and nutrition."
"This app could be so much better with a barcode scanner to add your foods. Also when you request a food item to be added, there is nowhere to write the brand. The excersize part of the app is pretty bad too actually. Good app for tracking nutrition, sleep and for counting steps."
"Since the last update it doesn't sync with my watch (even though I have Galaxy watch 5). The steps counter does work except for half an hour in the morning and after that it doesn't sync or work anymore. Tried the clear cache thing it still useless. So glad i spent so much money on the watch only to be unable to make full use of it with their own app. I think it's time to return the watch and get a Huawei one, at least I know that one works with its own app."
"An app I use solely for heart rate monitoring should not need access to my phone, contacts, and location. Can't even use it without giving it full permissions to everything, so I recommend finding a less invasive health app. In response to Samsung's comment, if I don't use that feature of the app, you shouldn't need access to the permissions. Same reason I don't allow a calculator app to use my camera. It's not necessary."
"Once you are familiarised with its use, the app is accurate and informative record of your day including sleep tracker, balanced diet tracker (split between carbs, fat, and protein), steps, calories burned, calories taken in. The best feature is that it takes all the activity data from the Samsung Health app on my Galaxy S3 frontier. I know exactly how many calories I can eat at any time of the day. Love it The ONLY update I would ask for, would be a barcode scanner for packaged food."
"the app used to be great, loved it, but so many changes and no longer as good as it used to be. way more options were available and now I almost like the fitbit app better. please go back, so many more options were available and were good options"
This app has a lot but can be even better. Would like to see a barcode scanner to add food items. Also would be nice if the sleep allowed you to see the actual times that you were awake as well as the times you were in the different sleep patterns.
I wish it would connect to Fitbit to give accurate step results. I don't always carry my phone with me especially around the house when I am doing chores. so it only records approximately half the steps I actually do. Also had tried to log my food into it but unable to log accurately as can only put in a whole or half portion and whilst I don't mind with some items things like butter you can't log at all as you have to input 100g or 50g
"It works great with GPS. We may get the weekly summary for times and calories but not for distance. Also I need the montly summary which is not availabe in the app although these are very simple feature to add. I think, these issues will be fixed soon."
"I am not enjoying the update. Since the update, simply picking up my phone counts as a step. I like knowing my steps for the day as I move around all day but it is no longer accurate. And also, now I cannot find any foods in the search area. Before, almost every food item I wanted to include, was found in search. Now when I want to log my meals, it does not find something as simple as Blackcat peanut butter or Pronutro. I also prefer the previous display. Loved the app before, now not so much."
A recent update makes the app crash more than ever. It's very buggy. I've used this app for years with no problems. But now it's slow to launch my fav foods and crashes when I click Done. I hope they fix this soon or I'll be Done with the app.
"i used to use this app daily and loved it. i won't use it now or in the future, as the updates to it, in my opinion have ruined it. it's difficult to use now and the food category has to be totally rebuilt.... i lost all of my data info that i built over the past two years when i upgraded to new version. you had an excellent product before.... leave good enough alone."
"I've used the app for years. New update requires access to mic and the apps ability to make phone calls. That's a deal breaker for me. FYI, if you own a galaxy watch. It is heavily tied to Samsung health. Eta, what you are basically saying is ""trust us, we are spying on you for your own good"""
i have enjoyed the app up until i found out i was pregnant... there isnt a pregnancy mode and its really frustrating since i want to be healthier now more than ever!! It would also be nice to change the type of diet program your on. before i became pregnant i fasted twice a week and this app just kept telling me i was doing it wrong!
"Overall, a good app. Works best with smartwatches, of course. If you don't carry your phone every step you take during the day, all day, you have to guess your exercise. You can manually enter almost any info, but the menu of food items by brand is extensive. It includes some medicines & vitamins by brand name, also. Suggestions for future updates: Food info charts for brands are only displayed with nutritional info. NEED SERVING SIZE and servings per container on these images! I had to go to product packages to find out how many servings I ate/drank of several products. The images only showed grams, the packages said how many cups and/or how many servings per container. The latter info is vital. Allow solid food to be entered by ""cup"", not just ""grams."" Most of us don't own a food scale, and many food item nutritional info charts use cups instead of grams. Add ability to have more than one timeslot per day of sleep. Ability to enter daytime naps & times spent awake during the night (for those of us with sleep issues) would be helpful in monitoring our situations. Currently, the program only allows for one long stretch of sleep. Sleep problems are common for mature people. It would also be good to be able to enter blood sugar numbers, or interface with blood sugar monitors. My Type II diabetic husband would find this app to be far less useful than others. On the plus side, today I saw that its calculation for time slept during the Daylight Savings time change DOES take into account the extra/lesser hour. So even though I officially fell asleep at 1:40am (2:40am, old time), it correctly said I got four hours of sleep when I woke at 4:40am. Also, a ""took daily medications/vitamins"" would be nice to have, also not having to enter each item individually every day. It could either be entered in its own category or with ""food"" section, on the same level as ""Lunch"", ""Dinner"" etc. As it is now, I have to enter each med and supplement separately, and can only save them separately to my ""Favs"". Maybe have option to set up one ""SET"" of items we are supposed to take every day, then we can simply choose that set from our ""Favs."" My college-age daughter uses it more effectively than I do. It has encouraged her to exercise more, eat better. So I DO recommend it for people with few health issues besides needing some weight loss, and who always have their phone/smartwatch on their person."
"I love this app, it's definitely one of the best all around & easiest to use. I would give it 5 stars but for the past couple of months I noticed it has a problem correctly tracking certain micronutrients. One example is calcium. This morning I had 3 servings of a supplement that would put me at 1750mg of calcium for the morning but it shows that I have only consumed 167mg. Can you please fix??"
"Doesn't tell you if your finger is centered or not on the pulse check. Just says to center your finger but does not bother to tell you the best spot it's actually picking up your pulse. It would help if It showed a signal that got stronger or weaker based on your fingers position so you know the best place, or pressure to apply.."
"""various bug fixes and improvements"" was a lie. The application won't open now without internet connection: ""can't set up app. Server error occurred, try again later"". I could use it offline before the update without issues. Feels like extortion of my data."
SP02 sensor function was removed. This presents a problem for me as it's something that I need to track! This function was one of the reasons I bought an S8. Samsung has arbitrarily removed something I have paid for. Contacting support is totally useless with no results or answers at all. I have used Galaxy phones since S2. The S8 is the last one. As much as I dislike Apple that's what my next phone will be coming May
"I uninstalled it today. Permission for phone call? Really?!!! Can't you guys make the app useful without needing permission for phonecall and camera? Even if you have best intentions, it only takes someone hacking into your systems to make all those who gave the permissions vulnerable. FB, Google, etc were hacked. What gives you the assurance that you can't be? Bye bye. It was nice being with you"
"Latest update demands access to all phone contacts. If declined, none of the funcionality (that was previously available) works. I connected with friends on Together prior to this update without having to give Samsung all my phone contacts. Oh, and I need to give my phone number and it's not even optional. Why?! EDIT: Appreciate Samsung reply but I'm not wasting any more of my life talking to clueless Samsung call centres. How about you, as a company, start RESPECTING PRIVACY?"
"I have a Samsung watch 3 and have just upgraded to the Samsung S22 ultra from the S20 ultra, since then my watch and phone have stopped syncing Stepps workouts etc. It is very disappointing as I use my phone to keep track of my training and step count. The app was brilliant and really helped my with keeping fit and active but now I am left disappointing. I have spoken to Samsung on the chat but left feeling even worse as I knew more about it than they did. I am sorry I upgraded my phone now."
This app was great when i firat started using it a couple of years ago. Now after the last update cant keep it on. Click the icon and the start screen appears then closes. Cant keep it open. The widget counts my steps but cant open the app. Tried numerous times to unistall and reinstall with no luck. Wish i could find another app to use between my watch and phone as this app does not work
"After the last update, I'm not able to sign in. It keeps loading forever, nothing happens, no errors or warnings shown. Please fix this. I've just bought an Active2 to track my exercises. I've tried reinstalling the app, clean cache, force stop, but nothing works."
"App permissions now REQUIRE you to allow the app full access to phone and contacts or you can't use it, no thanks!!! I will find a health tracking app with less invasive permissions. The Bot reply that states they will only use this info for managing the app... Right, which is why the Ads are now everywhere, while functionality is being removed, if the feature is OPTIONAL then the permission should be too!"
"I like the fact that my phone automatically registers with Samsung Health. I just wish it would sync with my Fitbit, so i can get rid of the inefficient Fitbit app. The app tasks the number of steps, calories and utter health related biometrics. It works best out of the other health apps I have."
"Missing Heart Rate Measurement! It isn't that the feature isn't available on the newer version phones, like the S20+. It is available, just no longer through this app. Use Google Fit if you want the HR monitor. It stinks because Samsung isn't incentivizing me to buy a smartwatch, they are only annoying me and I use the Google Fit app instead. Please update the darn app and give the heart rate sensor back. Because it isn't a limitation on the phone. It is an app limitation! Disappointing!"
"Keeps spinning the wheel after entering account details to login. Tried 5 times, doesn't get past this. Shockingly amateur!! . . Edit to respond to developer: No, that does NOT help. This issue has been around for months, still persists. The only way is to skip the initial login screen, get into the app and then login from within settings."
"I only do dance workouts with some core after, and there is no workout option for dance. So unfortunately I cannot track my workouts correctly. Don't understand why this is not an option as dance workouts are becoming more and more widely used. Would expect Samsung to be on top of this."
"It was ok when I could just use the app. Then you guys decided to force me to give you my email by making app inaccessible without logging in. Not very good, but, well, okay, here you go. Now you want a bunch of permissions to access my phone. Whaaat the hell? It's just an app to track health data. Definitely not cool. And it's not necessary to block the whole app if user denied to give some permissions: there's an ""if"" operators in every programming language."
"I'm a kitesurfer and bought new Samsung Galaxy watch with idea of having the same sport tracking activities as S Health has. But in reality it is limited and activities cannot be transferred or exchanged between s health and watch! Why i need kitesurfing tracking on the phone ? Nobody carries phones while kiting! It needs to be updated!   I had to reduce feedback based on general feedback of support ""call 1-800-..."""
"Gutted to see the weight management option removed. It was awesome and the main reason I used the app.... helped me lose 10kg with daily targets that included exercise calories and food calories combined... Any chance of getting it back?? Or if not, any suggestions of an alternative app that does what weight management used to?"
"I cannot open this app after latest update. Even after allowing all the permission its still not working. I have been using this app for past 4 years it is really disoppointing how easy it was to use this app in the past. I want to use the spo2 meter, which i am not able to use and check my oxygen level. I live in a area where covid cases are very high."
"Awful update. Weight management has disappeared. This part of the app is so important to me and my husband. It has allowed me us to loose weight, and then maintain. We need it back!! Also missing the caffeine tally. ******Edited - Samsung Electronics co., Ltd Thanks for the reply. What is that? A telephone number? I'm not calling you and incuring charges! It almost seems like a scam. If it's genuine, seriously unhelpful response. Just give us the facilities back that were taken away! üò°"
"I liked this app for mapping my runs and rough times/speeds. Then they wanted email addresses to log on, and now want two step verification... I would have liked a lite version as I don't use their net features or do social stuff, but now will have to find an alternative."
"What the heck happened? I've been using a Samsung phone and watch for years through numerous variations. Suddenly the stress function doesn't work, the sleep now only shows hours in bed instead of the breakdown of light, REM, deep, so it's useless now, and the blood oxygen function also doesn't work now. I paid good $$ for these functions on my phone and watch, so I expect them to work, not be disabled by an update! You've disabled functions I paid to have on my devices. Unacceptable."
"Overall, I love all the features of this app. In 6 weeks, I've lost nearly 10 pounds using this app. If I could request one change, I would ask for a product barcode scanner when adding foods. The food search has been pretty tedious."
"Helping me to help myself. Just started using it. User friendly. For food...love they have restaurant items. Suggestion: for water, would be helpful to be able to input ounces manually instead or in addition to the 8 oz. increments. I drink out of a brand name bottle that is 33.8 ounces. It would be nice to count every drop."
"I loved this app. Aug 2020 update made me drop from 5 stars to 3. This update (Jan 2021) has made me drop it to 1 star. It's lost its functionality. It's lost tracking the 6 individual meals (now it just has BLD and ""snacks"" lumped together). The fitness part has gotten worse--no longer workout vs just movement."
"2021 Update ruins app. Been using this app for about 2 years, everytime they carry out a major update, all my saved data and info within the app is erased. With the 2021 update you cant even start the app, without enabling 2 step verification! Why? To protect my private data)) The data they delete everytime I update the app lol. No thanks, plenty of heart rate apps, on the store that work much better."
"It's ok, certainly room for improvement. The food diary is not the smoothest to use. The global monthly walking challenges aren't very motivating and allowing the top 10 players to have hit 1 million steps in a matter of days is not realistic. Give us some real data."
"Yes. This is an amazing app, it works perfectly on a Samsung device. It has a lot of activities, also adding routine routes and saving them is fantastic and easy. It works even better if you have a fitness wearable from Samsung."
"Was loving this app and constantly compared my night's sleep etc using this app and my Samsung watch. However since the 14th I haven't been able to get my information to sync to the app. It says it's all connected and my accounts are all fine. I've reset the watch, app and phone and it still doesn't work. Sad really as it makes me want to sell the last of my Samsung tech"
"No Longer User-Friendly: This app has always needed more user-friendly settings, but with every update, they take away more and more of the usefulness. Example: Now you can no longer see weekly or monthly weight views, only daily. Why was this downgraded!?! People use this app for various reasons during different phases of their life. We need MORE tailorable options, not LESS!"
"In latest phones step count is entirely inaccurate to a tune of a few hundred. When pairing a galaxy wearable fitness tracker, the step count is somehow off by a few thousand. Its a shame because I've been using this app for years but now it just... doesn't report accurately at all."
"I've been using this app for years, first on an S6 then a S9. Just got a S20 and the functionality is less than it was before. No heart rate monitor, no stress monitor. I would expect things to improve over time! Shame as it was a definite 5 stars before, now I'm being generous with 2, as I doubt I'll really use it."
"Again, new changes, and again, some things are woser then it used to be: Obviouvous decline in the graphics (e.g. design, history of excercises is now way too complicated, simplified comarison with age groups as still less info on weekly targets (no averidge step count and trends, among others) And it is a pity, because it was perfect 2 years ago! And no, I will not call the number who knows where, spending time and probably lot of money!"
I hate the new version . It was a very good app for me . I been using it for 3 years . I don't like the the new food listing . I don't like the fact that they removed one meal and the fact that the vitamins/minerals are on an other page . I'll be looking for a new app for now unless they go back to the old version which I doubt since it would be like admitting that they were wrong . Frustrating . No daily macros tracking in grams . THIS IS A DOWNGRADE !!!
"I love this app and will give 5 stars as soon as Samsung adds two features. First, add ketone tracker. Secondly, add a screen to view multiple data graphs at once. Being able to view how sleep, exercise, nutrition, ketones, blood sugar, and heart rate INTERACT would be very helpful."
"Used to love it. Changes in last year or so have made it harder to manage data, and made it easier to lose data permanently without realizing it. Case in point - ECG data from Health Monitor app is NOT synced as it appears, and the user only finds out about this after resetting or changing devices and finding out that their ECG history has been lost forever. Major gap! Why is it so hard to sync this data, OR tell the user they have to sync it manually and tell them how to do that? Edit - Samsung support told me that ECG data cannot be synced or transferred manually, even though the app says 'sync data'."
"If I could give a lower rating I would. After spending hundreds of dollars on Samsung products, I now discover that at some point in the past Samsung removed the ability to link third party services to Samsung Health. Now Strava is the only option. It's an option I've tried before and did not like, I preferred other options that used to work with Samsung Health. I didn't buy Samsung products to get locked into their inferior apps. Definitely replacing my Galaxy Watch with a Wear OS on asap."
"The new version has ads at the top that can't be removed. They are advertising things I already have, its so annoying. Also weekly and monthly step data is no longer accessible, it only does the past 7 or 31 days. This app use to be so good"
"Easy and fun to use. Helps you be more aware of your health and activity. I really like the monthly global challenges it offers you. One comment though relating to the challenges: You can do ""personal"" challenges as well, however you need ""Samsung friends"" in order to do these challenges. And I dont have friends with this app. So I can't do those challenges. Only the Global monthly challenges. Besides that, great app!"
It's good on only Samsung device. No doubt it's useful for me. But I think it should work on other phones too. Why don't you make it hardware independent so that it can run on other smartphones also? Dt. 24sep19 I had again installed it on Redmi Note 6 Pro. But it is not showing any step count. On other hand Samsung On5 Pro calculates 0.5 km accurately as both devices are with me.
"First, I am a man/male. The app seems to be geared towards women. When I go to the fitness section the first thing under ""Programs picked for you"" is about pregnancy stretching. This and other women's issues really don't pertain to what I am trying to achieve. This app should be tailorable. And yes, I discussed this with customer support who indicated nothing could be done but she would pass along our discussion."
Lost a years worth of health data but Samsung Support won't help get it back. The app also requires permissions that seem unnecessary like access to my phone calls. Going to give a different brand of health tracking smartwatch a try. Actually ended up deleting it all together as it was destroying my battery life. Just use the Galaxy Watch for notifications now.
"This app was good up until the latest update. I used to be able to see my macros summed up nice and easy on the display, now all I can see is the weird percentages that just don't make sense to me. I mean you could keep the percentages, but why did you remove the actual numbers? What if a person isn't following your macro breakdown and just want to know what their total macros were? For tracking workouts and activity, this app is fine. But for food, y'all took away the second best feature."
"App was great, but now when I go running it'll randomly stop tracking and pause and if it doesn't pause, it doesn't track the distance correctly at all. It used to track really well, no issues, but something odd has happened recently."
"Can't uninstall this, so if you don't need much from a ""fitness"" app, you can use this without looking for one that actually works. Steps is a required measurement, and distance isn't even available. For those of us who run, this is almost pointless.  TLDR; uses steps, not distance. Almost completely useless."
"Not able to indicate that I'm pregnant. I started using this app to track my health and fitness during my pregnancy (weight, blood pressure, blood glucose, etc). Unfortunately, there are no options for selecting pregnancy. So based on my BMI I am just obese.. I'm hoping it will be less discouraging once the baby is born and I'm losing the weight."
Food tracking is frustrating. It's hard too decide what the serving size is. For example it just told me that the serving size for hotdogd was 57 grams. But no info on how much that is. One hotdog? 2 hotdogs? Most items are like this and your only recording options are grams or calories. I want to put in I ate two hotdogs and have the program figure out the rest. Also I wish that my most recently used foods would come up first and also my most frequently used. There should be those buttons.
"Please allow integration with"" Health Sync"". I have not updated my SHealth App in over 2 month Because of this latest issue. Please stop removing our INTEGRATIONS!! Pretty Please. . Not too crazy about the new design. And what happened to the Fitbit and Misfit Integrations. Under connected Services there is one item and it is Strava. I'm a loyal Samsung customer and have been a big fan of all of your products and apps, but I I am slightly disappointed."
"Just found out where to enable the inactivity alerts. Everything looks good on the app. Have few issues which are minor, 1) If I don't open this app for a long time, I have to go to samsung wear to connect the band and then come to health app to view the updated info. 2) In sleep tracking, there are many ""awake"" lines which don't seem to make sense since I won't be awake so many times during the night."
"Could never get this app to load. Bought an Active 2 watch, can view details for the app on the watch, but app never launches on the phone. Looking for a quick fix here, or will need to return the watch. Update... So called Samsung technical support, and they referred me to a mobile repair centre to have them look into fixing my phone... Too much!"
"Would be great if the monthly challenge could sync with the gear so that if you join the challeng late, then your steps at the beginning of the month would still be still counted. Other than that. Love this app, the challenges and the ""together"" function."
"Further edit, if I could give this 0 stars I would. The latest watch active 2 update is supposed to offer ecg and blood pressure monitoring. Quite simply, the function is not there. Anywhere. I have downloaded and installed the correct software on the phone and watch, it's now available and approved for UK use. It does not work. I'm off to Apple, you can keep your Samsung stuff."
This app has gone backwards since I started using it 4 years ago. The stress monitor has become useless about 8 months ago with an update and it doesn't pick-up half of the physical exercises it did previously. if the Health app is useless it makes the use of the Smartwatch superflous to my needs.
"Use to like this app, but now they did an update and requires access to things on my phone it doesnt need. This app does not need access to my phone to ""make or view calls."" The app also should not need my contact list to function properly. If I want to add it, that's one thing, but requiring it is ridiculous-I do not wish to contact to others through this app. Super disappointed that this app decided to move in this direction."
"I used to use this app daily, to track my pulse and blood 02. But with this update, for some unknown reason, they have removed the blood 02 functionality. Now the only way to even see it, is to use the tedious ""stress"" reading option, but even so, there is no way to track blood oxygen trends. I haven't updated to One UI for the very reason that I don't want Samsung making my phone less functional, but it seems like I've made a big mistake updating the health app. Please fix this, IMMEDIATELY."
"I loved this app, however with the latest update I've noticed that my recorded work out calories burned has decreased by at least 300, and my heart rate is not recording correctly. My heart rate was well above 140 bpm and this showed that it was 92.. These bugs need to be fixed asap!"
The latest update has ruined the app. No longer can adjust the weight tracking graph to view in months or weeks. It's just a daily long line you have to scroll giving you no useful information. With all the other issues I've had lately and the feature reduction each generation in Samsung phones I'm now looking at getting an Apple iPhone.
"Completely inaccurate! I put my phone in my pocket right by my thigh(cargo style pants, basically attached to my thigh)and wore it through a 12 hour shift which, due to the nature of my job, I walk the whole time! The app estimated that I only walked approximately 90 minutes. Subtracting time for my brief breaks and standing time(still moving around performing various task), the app fell short 8 to 8 1/2 HOURS of walking time and all of the steps included in that time. Extremely disappointing!"
"I'm pretty sure this app would be great if it didnt keep telling me to place my finger properly over the sensor eventhough its completely over the sensor, i didnt move or make any noise and theres a steady wave showing Happens ALL the time. Tried several fingers, removed case, cleaned the sensor. Keeps happening then suddenly it works. I try again a few minutes later and it dont work. Then when it finally works my blood pressure is high cuz I'm frustrated by the damn thing randomly working! Ugh!"
"I love how detailed the food intake, weight, sleep etc. data is and the resulted calculations are from it. It has scheduled workouts and training. Also competitive live events you can compete with your friends. ALSO there is a place to post pics and blogs to share ur thoughts. This app has it all, EXCEPT a much needed widget for ease and quickness of food entry or excersizes....think about it maybe."
Very helpful in tracking steps throughout the day. Been a source of encouragement to try better food selections and track. I'm experiencing more energy and better fitness. Would like more food selection or ability to enter your own brand choices in the meals section.
I was having trouble using this app on my new A7 phone. I've since found out (by myself ..no help from Samsung) that this app was one that had power saving turned on ..have now switched this off for Samsung Health and app counting steps and miles correctly. I only found this out by downloading another step counting app which on set up took me to somewhere in my phone that had a list of all apps on power save..where this is on my phone ..I have no idea as I can only access it via this other app !
It used record the steps so accurately and send the active time notification very accurately until monday!I updated the app and boom all the accuracy is gone.The step counting is getting stuck and the active time is recorded wrongly.It is very exhausting that the app is not recording the steps properly.This app used to motivate me walk more but now it makes me sad that I walk the same but the app isn't recording the steps. Still I believe in this app and will wait until next update.Love this app
"Been using this app for years and I'm about to delete it. In the weight management screen on the bottom of the screen has ""related content"" since when is pornographic pictures related to weight management? These sleezy women are wearing next to nothing with all the frills. Disgusting. That is not related to weight loss. It's your sick way of promoting sex. I will wait to see if you do anything about it, but it's being ditched very soon if you don't ."
This app has helped me become a lot more healthy. I love that it's not just locked to android and all of the features seem to have a healthy amount of content. Some of the articles are bias and out there but as far as a health app it's the full meal deal.
"Please fix the bugs that are occuring with this app in my new s22 ultra! I need my steps to sync with my watch. I wish my phone still counted steps. Uuggg! Old review: Love having an all in 1 app! The only thing I wish it did have, that doesn't have yet, is a bar code scanner for easy food searches"
"The app was 5 star until the last update. The weight management section is gone which was one of the reasons I started using the app. I've also noticed that when I'm running and I get a call or text, it says data lost for that time. It never did that before the update."
"Decent. But the widgets could be better. All they have is the step counter, but having the little heart with my steps, etc. would be very helpful. Or the widget to add a glass of water. I don't have the watch, but if it does it on a watch then I should be able to get the same widgets on my actual phone. Right?"
"this is a good app for anyone who wants to get a free step tracker app without buying a watch. Its a good app but sometines it can be quite falty and not count steps properly, for example me and my 2 friends went for a walk and both of their counters were the same but mine was lower so please fix that and i will give you 5 stars."
"Liked this app, but then it wanted access to messaging and phone calls. Seems like a lot to count steps and heart beeps. Uninstalled the updates, blocked the app. The rhetoric from the developer in response to my post is pure dribble. Not wanting any new feature, I am unable to access my data without the encroachment into my privacy. I shouldn't have to tell a developer like Samsung that I should have the option to use the new feature or not, only allowing the permissions if I choose to use it."
Encouraging app but it's disappointing that people can cheat. I go head-to-head against mates for walking challenges and use it to track my exercise etc. I started joining the global month long challenges but disappoints me that the challenge winners in a day or 2 are over a million steps. Good app though and can do lots with it
"I use this app daily and it really does a great job. It is free and has been better than any other similar apps i have tried. Leaving the review only to voice the opinion of the new update and interface. Not a fan like so many others. Some slight changes would be ok. This new is less, practically and visually. Still 4 stars for such a helpful app."
"This has been a really useful app for the few years I have used it. However the update this month, August 2020, removed a weight management widget. Samsung replied to my enquiry about the reason for deleting this widget by saying they are constantly looking to make improvements and to make the app more relevant. In my opinion it makes the app worse and I am now actively looking to change to something which will give me the weight management functionality that Samsung say the public no longer want or need. Such a shame."
"Used to be great and my favorite for nutrition tracking but the most recent update requires to many permissions. Phone, contacts, etc. No info provided as to why other than ""it provides a better experience"" All permissions have to be granted in order to use the app which seems unnecessary and invasive."
"I really do like this app. I like the functionality it has and offers a lot of different tracking type things. I do with though that there was a way to scan my foods bar code rather than type everything in. I use a different all for that instead now. Personally, not having that one function makes me explore other app opportunities out there. If there is a way and I'm missing it, please explain and I'll give this a 5 start rating. :)"
"Loved the older version, for some reason when I go horseriding, waking, running it doesn't want to count the distance. Its not my phone because I downloaded a different step count app and it recorded the distance correctly. Also the food list gets stuck sometimes or just goes blank."
"This app is not accurate for counting calories burned during a workout. So what's the point? In my opinion, that is one of the most important features in the app, and it doesn't work properly. I have a pulse device connected to it, so the calories burned should be more accurate than what it shows. I guess I will keep using the pulse app. Sad this issue hasn't been fixed yet...."
"I love this free app. Setting my weight target and adjusting my calorie intake. If I go over it tells me how much I need to burn. No ""flex"" which I feel sets you up for failure. I just ordered a Samsung fit watch to sync more accurately. Also love the global challenges and brings out that drive to do better"
"Every time you guys update this app, which is quite often, it resets the data permissions making me have to go and turn them back on so I can sync with myfitnesspal. I then tried to contact you with the email listed here and you tell me that email isn't used for contact, poor customer service and poor performing apps. Think of the users when you make these things... (4/8/19)another inactive response from Samsung, not going to spend hours on the phone explaining this to someone who has no idea"
"This used to be my preferred fitness app. Now many features seem to require a wearable of one kind or another. I don't have one because they are too expensive. Also, I used to use it to track my stress and heart rate multiple times a day. That feature was removed. I also used it to track my steps, but the info it gives for that is now so minimal as to be useless. Step tracking information should be pretty fundamental at this point, but it's not."
"I just recently updated this app on my phone and every 10 seconds or so the app would open with an error message about being unable to open on a rooted phone. this phone has never been rooted, and this error never happened before this update. I actually had to uninstall the app just so that I could post this."
Update has rendered this application useless. It wants to force me to set up two factor authentication Well just fine I put my password in I get my code but on a Pixel 3 XL there is no way to actually press enter on the code The verified button is greyed out and no attempt to try to make it work. So basically I can't use the app anymore Thanks a lot for nothing.. I also find the need to agree to having my contacts and my phone permissions always available to your application ridiculous.
"I loved this app until the recent update where it removed the weight management features. I just got rid of my fitbit and bought the Samsung watch and got the app for this feature. Now I regret making the switch. Pointless and useless now, its much harder to use and I lost all my data for this week."
"I only use this to record weight. An update removed the ability for a macro view of progress. Instead now you are only able to swipe from day to day to see progress, instead of week to week, or another time lapse unit."
"So, I've been using this app for some time. I love that I was able to target my steps daily. I'm not sure what has happened. But for several months now, the app has been failing. Apparently, while I sleep, it counts ghost steps. Sometimes, I wake up to over 1000 steps."
"Taking away the Weight Management category is why I only gave 1 star. That was the worst thing to take away, it really helped me see where I was each day with my caloric intake vs. expenditures. Please bring that back. Don't want to have to try and find another app that will work with my Samsung gear watch. Don't want to have to give up on Samsung, you were the best. Now, not sure."
"Awful registration experience, 10 emails received to change my password, but does not work with the default Android password manager, does not want to work with my Google account only. Horrible experience, I quit. I bought Samsung Watch, hoping for a smooth and pleasant workflow, but it seems impossibly complicated to get in if you don't want to give your phone number."
Never had issue with exercise tracker until recently. When using in bicycle mode the app stops tracking my data so I get a really really abbreviated report! Frustrated. Update: I called spoker to a rep he had me try a few things and the App works no better. It only tracks for short distance then stops. Where I ride has very limited trees so should not be issue with GPS. 1 star now!
This app is the most easy to use health tracker I've seen. The fact that it's free is tremendous. You can literally show it to your doctor/nutritionist for goal numbers and track them all through this app. And the ability to share your numbers in an easy to read format is invaluable. I recommend this app for those who are totally healthy as well as those who have health concerns. Well done!
"I'm satisfied with this app after using it for 6 months now, but I'm not able to use the together feature in the app. When I try and add my friends for challenges, the app shuts automatically and crashes all the time when I press Add button. Is there any fix for this? I'm using the latest version of this application."
"I like this app a lot, but am disappointed that the pulse oximeter has now been completely removed from the app. And during a pandemic when people have a strong interest in knowing their blood oxygen levels, even if they're not as accurate on a smart phone as on a medical device. Please bring that feature back."
"This WAS my favorite health app, until it decided to lock the entire app unless I grant permission to make and manage phone calls. If that permission is only needed for the ""together"" feature, as mentioned in a developer reply, then just disable that one feature! Don't lock the entire app when I withhold that permission. I'll return my rating to 5 stars once that issue is fixed. Until then, the app is literally unusable."
I love this app even more than I have in the past 4 years. I love the improvements adding the weight management lets me know when I need to get moving because I over indulged on the food side. I just wish they would add a scanner to the food input side. Great app though!
"I love using the app. Now I can gauge what I eat to pick the best option. However, I would like if you could add some west African dishes to the food options available or improve the ""my food"" option so I can adjust any mistake I make while imputing a meal. Thanks so much"
"Nice app, I enjoy the simplicity and how my watch data automatically records. The one thing I would really like to see is to be able to scan the nutritional information of my food items rather than having to use a third party app, search it or manually enter it."
Updated 7/20: I'm happy they fixed the weelky summaries and added back in the average daily steps along with comparisons - so I'm adding two stars back. I would love get better reports on weekly and monthly running mileage. I really like that I can get step counts and cadence analysis on my runs without having to buy another device. This is the only feature that's keeping me from switching completely over to Strava right now.
"Doesn't work. Been over a week and still can't log in. I called and was told to be patient and it's a known issue. You would thing with how much money samsung makes, the developers would have experience to fix the issue in a timely manner. I wish I could get my money back for this expensive worthless watch since the app can't be used and is needed for the features of the watch."
A health app that needs to make phone calls? Why? Fishy. Reply from developer is not helpful. The phone permission is required to move forward with using the app even if you don't use the together feature. It should be optional. Stop forcing permissions. Make them optional for additional features. 1 star
"App is good, but I would like to be able to enter manually the calories, cause in my country there most of the food choices are not available, and it takes a lot of time to choose the right food a d amount of calories. Is it also possible to add xiaomi smart scale 2 body composition?"
The latest update on android has messed with your app. The steps are now totally wrong. I've gone from running 1k in 5 mins 40 seconds just yesterday to 4 mins 15 seconds today after the update thats way wrong. when I click to add water it has to save each press before i can add another.. why! please fix this now. Thanks
"At one point in time I used this app, specifically the weight management part, to lose about 50 pounds. I had started using it again to get myself back on track, but it updated today and now weight management is just gone. I see no point in keeping an app that has taken away the one feature that was most valuable to me, so I will be uninstalling it. I have already asked my friends for recommendations of a different health/fitness app."
"I use this app all the time for the last year. The latest update broke the audio guide while running. The average pace it says is nowhere near my actual average pace, sometimes double what it should be or what workout summary days at the end."
"Used to be one of my favorite apps, used it almost daily, but the new policy update has locked me out of using it unless I agree to let the program 'make and manage phone calls.' Why does a fitness tracker need to make phone calls or 'manage' (i.e. listen to) them? Guess I'll be uninstalling and looking for a different fitness app. And,Guess they'll have to rely on one of their other multiude of apps to 'manage' my phone calls."
"I don't understand why the weight management tab was removed from the latest update. This is quite frustrating, I used it on a daily and weekly basis. It would be great if that feature could be brought back because apart from that it ticks all my health app needs."
"I'd really like to see some changes made in the food tracking area....Would be nice if we could scan a barcode from a paticular food and have it populate for us, or at the very least the abIlity to manually input a foods info (serving size,cal,cabs,sugar etc). when selecting the serving size allow it to be entered in oz. for example a ""serving size"" is 4.0 oz but I'm only eating 3.8oz the nutrients in the log should automatically adjust to show for that 3.8oz figure."
"Worked great, now frustrating. Using with Galaxy Watch (0A7A) and Omron monitor BP7000, both via a Samsung Galaxy S10+ cell phone. At first it worked great with the BP7000, automatically entering new readings. However, now that is not happening. I have tried rebooting the phone, didn't help. I unpaired and paired the unit again, but to no avail. Any suggestions? (It was a 5-‚òÜ prior to this problem.)"
The stress tracker with oxygen measurement is not available for the Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G. Why? Why can't you just respond here! I am not the only person asking that you bring this back for measurement from the phone. Basically your product just abandoned your customers during a point in history where you could have made a difference. Not only that but reinstalling the app and connecting to a watch didn't bring back the capability. It just dropped it all togegher.
"App now requires access to phone calls and contacts, even if you don't want to use together features. I've used the app for years, but my privacy is more important. Make together and its permissions optional. Developer reply to my review is utterly tone deaf and ignores the situation. They just want your data, period."
Can you please bring back weight management? It's literally the most important feature on the app. Why would you remove it? I've used this app every day for years. Weight management helps me regulate my calories in and out. The app is almost useless to me now without it. I'm also annoyed because my buying a Samsung watch was a complete waste of $350 because I only got it to properly track my calories burned with the calories I'm eating!
"i quite love it, heart rate reading on my phone is quite accurate, and so it the sleep time. both can be quite useful! also my steps. dont use water intake much, forget to put how much i drank and food calories is a pain. Theres always amazing free programmes for weight loss, stretches, endurance, muscle build etc."
"It's okay, but there is an option on the watch for weight management, but no way to access it on the app. This is a big feature to be missing. The sleep tracking is not always accurate, and I can't edit it without deleting the while record."
"Ads. Yes there are ads I see a Netflix ad on the top banner of the home page of the app. This isn't going to make Samsung look very good when all their phones have ads built into the default apps. Also to the dev who responded to me have a look at the app on the store. It says ""Contains ads"" oops. :P"
"On my Samsung S20FE, Health can't track my location in the background. On Android 11, I can't grant background location access permission ('Allow all the time') to the app not even manually. I suspect developers failed to include a request for ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION. Therefore, 'Auto detect workouts' feature in the background unable to map my workouts. Please fix it! UPDATE: It's a shame that developer didn't even read my problem and gave an automated answer not related to my question. Pathetic customer handling. üëé ‚òπ"
"This app changed, and not for the better. It's asking now to log in, forcing to create an account ... and I am an occasional user. Then it's asking for verification by texting a code ... my phone number is not part of it. You are forcing people to submit their personal info, to collect personal data. Not cool!!! From being an enjoyable app, it's now useless."
"Frustrated beyond belief now! I have used this app for a few years to track what I eat, help me maintain & monitor my sugar & carbs. Loved it & had until the past 2 weeks. Not working most of the time, keeps crashing, not saving info and keeps logging me out! NEED TO FIX THIS PROBLEM!"
"The app was working fine, and I would have rated it higher, however since doing a software update this morning if I try to view a map from an exercise with GPS enabled the app crashes. I've tried clearing the cache, rebooting my phone and even my samsung watch, all to no avail.."
"Pretty versatile app! My only (tiny) issue is the food tracking portion. There's not a super easy way to sort through menu items, but also not all food items are on there. I had an almond milk iced latte from coffee bean and couldn't locate that on the app so I choose something sorta similar and hoped the calories were within the same ball park. Overall satisfied though!"
"Latest update is the worst. There's no way to see the list view of blood pressure or weight or sleep. You have to scroll to each day to see if you have anything recorded. The trend line is daily, so if you're only measuring once a month it's pretty useless."
"Updated and new privacy policy. I fail to understand why a health app needs access to my contacts among other items, and won't work without it. Sorry Samsung, am sick of the privacy intrusion and after reading your privacy policy (I encourage users to do so and think about it) and how you will use mine and my contacts, I can use other less intrusive apps, or (wow!) a piece of paper, pencil and calculator. A shame, the app is so easy to use, but isn't a necessity for life."
"One year I am using this app...but the challenge is the same ...every month I need to finish 200k steps and the rest in the sea....a bit bored... The same pattern every time... I hope Samsung app can improve the challenge....like get or collect points, star, rewards and actraction in the middle of the challenge... Examp like Apple Fitness app.."
"Terrible since the update. Can't sort weight or blood sugar by month or week anymore, so theres no way to view progress over time. 2/28/21- Are you ever going to fix this? It is so aggravating not to be able to see trends over time. It makes the app pretty much useless. It's a real shame you took a really good app and essentially ruined it"
Great fun and a good motivator to keep moving. Only issue is you really need a smart watch to properly record all your steps. My Fitbit app is always way ahead on step count. Pity Samsung don't offer a basic wrist or leg band to provide more accurate data.
That app is annoying because it wont let you edit data from any day previous or even the same day if you enter it in wrong or forget. This wouldn't be an issue but the whole point of the app is to give you reliable data feed back and trends so it defeats the whole purpose. One mistake and then the app just keeps sending you incorrect information all day long. Fix it
"My watch thinks I'm sleeping when I'm actually up and sitting on the sofa. This happens daily. There is an option to manually change the time you went to bed and got up but this option doesn't work. Once you make the changes and hit save, nothing. Please fix this. Otherwise the sleep function is useless and grossly incompetent."
"Found this app after being diagnosed with Afib last month. Heart rate monitor matches to hospital machines. Food diary has been a huge help tracking calories, though I'm not sure of the accuracy of the nutrient levels (i.e. on sodium). Can't find some brands, but still a great app and very helpful!"
"Love this app. I use it every day and it is better than a fitbit. I get all my numbers from one place and it is very accurate. Since this app is easy to understand and follow, i cannot help but try to reach my daily goals. I also love the monthly challenges and the chance to race against my friends and other Samsung users."
"Subpar . This app needs severe updates. Steps stop tracking an hour before the cut off. Calories items are all off and in need of up updating. Walking doesn't track GPS correctly. Auto exercising doesn't track exercising correctly. Calorie tracking bad. Favorites tracking bag. I was a Samsung guy but they got too big and forgot top make quality product. I will not buy Samsung again. No more phones, no more watches, no more 3D TVs, no more anything. They just don't care anymore. =["
"Wish there was a ""pregnancy mode""! I love that it has the period tracker, but it would be amazing to be able to flip a switch and have my stats account for pregnancy. Otherwise, I've no complaints about the app."
This app really really really needs a bar code scanner for food like fitbit has. This is a great watch but in busy lives no one has time to input the food when we know it can be scanned as fitbit does this. So the Samsung health app totally drains the battery. How do you fix the battery drain.
"All you have done is send a link to go to.menu . Send an email directly to converse re problems. It still does not work ie shows ""start walking"" still a minus 1 star app. You can't use &ustomer service menu. Can't turn on start walking after 2 days. Won't record steps. Only just downloaded. First few days worked. Now won't. Needs some sort of fix to record how many steps. Stopped working past 2 days after 3 days working. Settings won't work. Uninstall re installed still won't work"
The biggest change I'd make is the activity log. Why isn't there stairs for one of the activities? I work in a hospital and stairs are the most convenient form of exercise when I have a minute. But the app just tracks it as steps. I'd like up be able to go in and add stairs and house many flights I climbed.
The main reason that I ever used this app was for the quick measure feature. After a recent update I no longer have the options for Heart Rate and Stress Measurements at all on my Note 10+. According to the Notices in the app the quick measure feature was removed but you are supposed to still be able to measure Heart Rate and Stress within the specific modules for those and again they no longer exist in the app at all. I have uninstalled the application. Please bring features back for more stars
"Since the very beggining when i bought my phone, the app simply refuses to work. I try to reinstall , with update, with patience :) but it doesn't work. Just infinite loading of the contents and after a whille the phone freeze and it need either several home button tries or restart."
"Love this app but there seems to be an issue with the Women's health period tracker. If you input the start date, the next day it will say '1 day late' instead of day 2 of period. I thought it would adjust after I end the cycle but there isnt anywhere to input this info, so it keeps adding more late days. Would really like this part of the app to work properly"
Bring back the SP02 (pulse ox) ! Ok. I know the new galaxy phones have the pulse ox removed. But the pulse ox sensor has been a staple on the S phones since the S5. I liked using the SP02 sensor for doing intense workouts and checking my oxygenation and used that feature a lot. I wish Samsung would stop removing features. This is similar to removing the option to customize the background in messages. Gives me less and less of a reason to get another samsung phone.
"Recent update requiring access to my phone, contacts, storage is a deal breaker. I deleted the app. I'll find another one. I'm not sure which is worse, the mandated change to force access to information not needed for the app or the lame canned response to this issue."
"Uninstalled as soon as the new update asked for phone and contact permissions. I hope everyone does the same. No reason a health app needs phone and contact info ,don't belive their optimal experience excuse. I have had samsung since the galaxy so and I have seen them make great apps horrible with their updates too many times won't be getting a Samsung when it's time to upgrade again."
"Doesn't work anymore. Was updated ""3 days ago"". After opening the app I had to tap on a green ""Continue"" button. It seems to synchronise something, but never gets there. Shall try installing and reinstalling. Am only interested in the step counter. Device: Galaxy A50, Android 11, loads of free storage space. Edit 14 Apr 21: after doing above it worked. Have revised rating from 1 to 4 stars for now. BTW, I installed another popular app; pleased that number of steps differed only by 3 over 1000."
"I really hate this app, for months now I have had this problem where it doesn't sync with my watch and completely ignores all my steps sleep & workouts for the day. These functions are the only reason I bought a Samsung watch. As soon as I can I'm moving somewhere else. I am very disappointed."
"Great App but after last release NOT anymore. I loved the fact that you could have daily, weekly and monthly recap of your walks and in particular of your weight input. Now you can see only the weight data view on a daily timerange, and cannot see your weekly or monthly trens as before. Please implement this back and i give you 5 stars."
"Until I opted in for pie beta on my G 9+, I would have rated it 5 * But now, the step count is substantially understated. I finished the OCT challenge in the top 3%, but FAILED to meet the minimum target for November (bottom 8%). What's even stranger, I've just completed a round of ""walking"" exercise by MANUALLY starting and stopping it: 5.81 km, 40:32, 7514 steps. The home screen, however, just shows 1754 steps for the whole day! Obviously, this again puts me behind in the Dec. challenge. On the same phone (using the same hardware), GoogleFit shows 4,677 steps.  What gives?"
"For some reason, they've changwditso that once you start recording a route, it no longer tells you how far you've gone unless you stop the recording. It tells you all sorts of other stuff like max speed, elevation, etc, but not the most useful thing."
"This update causes my watch to quit counting steps properly. My Gear Sport works only after rebooting the watch with all connections to the phone disabled. Needless to aay, I very frustrated. 02/07 - still having watch lockup issues. Tech support was curtious and helpful but my issues are still unresolved. Help!"
"Always running on the background and my phone warning me this app is draining my battery. There should be a sync buttom on the app to sync your smartwatch with the app when needed instead of having it running nonstop in the background. Now I feel in order to preserve my battery life on my phone, I have no choice but to uninstall this app."
"Was a great app thats helping me lose weight. But in the most recent update they took away the feature that let me see how many calories I burned vs how many I consumed. I'm not sure why they would take this out as it seems to be a pretty basic function of a health app, and is something everyone likes."
"Liked and used this app often until the revision to the permissions and privacy agreements said that my data (not anonymous) was being shared / sold to 3rd parties with forced agreement to continue using it. Not OK!!! I declined and uninstalled it. Using another app, with no such infringements. Update 14, Apr 2021. After the previous response, and needing an O2 sensor, I had reinstalled the app and it worked well. The latest change forcing me allow it to make calls is ridiculous! Uninstalled!"
"I used the app solely as a step counter. All of a sudden I started getting notifications randomly asking if I was asleep between certain hours...a feature I never asked for to be turned on. Well, that f#@%ing annoying notification woke my son up as I was putting him down for a nap, so I'm uninstalling out of sheer frustration."
"I'm trying to use this app every day, but I can't make the current step notification go away. So annoying that it's always there! It was better when it only told me I reached the target steps and then I could swipe the notification away. If I turn off the step notification to make this go away, it doesn't even tell me that I reached the target. I think I'll just find another health app if they don't change this stupid setting..."
"bring back the single SpO2 monitor setting. I absolutely do not understand why you would shove that into a ""stress"" monitor setting. All the readings I had saved for my doctor are gone. This wasnt well thought out. Whats the point of being able to manage items if you removed the ability to do a singular O2 reading. makes zero sense Samsung."
I used this app on my Samsung S7 and it was amazing and worked perfectly. no issues. but I have now upgraded my phone to an Samsung S9 and the app won't even let me accept the terms and conditions so I can't use it. Can someone help me please as I really like this app. also I have tried to uninstall and reinstall
"Last update totally broke Strava importing. Before it was half broken and you could deactivate and reactivate Strava in your profile and it would at least pull in the info. Now nothing at all. Since I use a Wahoo heartrate monitor, cycling computer and a cadence sensor ( all Wahoo and not supported ) it's time to move on from this app even though I have the Active2. Not upset my devices are not supported, but saying stuff is and it doesn't even work is a deal breaker. Do devs even use it?"
The only reason i didnt give all stars is because the heart rate reader is ANNOYING!!! I swear i always have to do it like 4 times because when i finish working out it never seems to read it. Its says to stay still and quite!!! Ugh sorry but after running its really hard to keep my finger on that little read light for that long and by the time its actually an read it my heart rate has gone down so its not accurate!!! Thats all rant over please just fix the heart rate reader. Thanks!!!
"I really like this app. I did not give it five stars because, downloading your personal data is pretty useless. I have been tracking my meals that I eat on a daily basis. When I downloaded my personal data and open it in Microsoft Excel, it does not give you a list of the dates and the foods you ate on those dates, along with the nutrition info. The information is pretty garbled. Samsung should really fix this."
"Was great up until this week. Some activities I do have to be tracked via Strava (due to Strava intergrated connection on certain fitness equipment), and I need Strava to sync to Samsung health. Workouts from Strava were posting/syncing to Samsung health fine (albeit a few hours late sometimes) but it seems a recent update or something has broken this functionality. Strava activities no longer seem to post to Samsung Health. This needs to be fixed, it's one of the only reasons I chose a Samsung Galaxy Watch Active 2 of a Garmin device, and I'm still within my return period for the device. Please fix."
"This app hasn't worked for me since February with the same issue of ""Rooted"" phohe. I called customer service as adviced, and even though the person was awesome and tried his best, he couldn't resolve my issue. This was about a month ago and I still haven't received an answer. This is quite frustrating knowing for sure that I haven't done anything wrong and that this is the best app I could have for health."
The app was working fine until the new update where I've been experiencing an error everytime I open the app saying that the app cannot perform on a rooted phone. My phone isn't rooted. Hoping Samsung takes a look into this so it doesn't happen to others who use it constantly like I do.
"Agree with recent reviews. The requirement to access all call and contacts permissions is ridiculous. The answer given is to allow unique user data for the together feature, which I do not use. So why can I not opt out and continue to use the app Full contact data so I can check my heart rate? I've always preferred Samsung to apple as they haven't forced my hand, now the new permissions are doing exactly that"
"The app used to prompt me every morning to confirm my sleep times, but doesn't do that any more. As such, I rarely remember to enter the info. I can't find a setting to make that work again. Otherwise it's good for tracking walks, bike rides, or other exercise activities."
Love the app! Some of my fave features are the options for workouts. It had the majority of the machines I use at the gym. I would like to see more fitness challenges throughout the app but other than that.....LOVE IT!!!
"If it works don't fix it. Used to love this app. Bring back weight management and the original color scheme. As others have said the greens are much too similar. Also, not pleased that they changed the sleep tracking from a detailed breakdown that includes Awake time, REM sleep, Light sleep, and Deep sleep to the new bland and basic data of restless, light, and motionless. It's like they're taking the good features about this app and trimming them down. Bring it all back & easy 5 stars."
"I love this app. It really helps me to keep motivated and reminds me to workout everyday. The only reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 is because the preview only ""shows"" you what is expected of the exercise, it would be more helpful to explain in the preview how to do the exercise correctly, what to keep in mind and what not to do. I would also like to see a search option so I can search for stretching, HIIT or body weight exercises. Thanks for your motivating app üôÇ üíì"
"While I use this Samsung Health quite regularly to accompany me in my cycling or jogging exercise..it lack 1 very essential feature, it should has a Heart Rate Programmable Alarm as it core feature. As far as I know..none of the phone base exercise apps has this feature. Even better if the app can inform the user if the HR changes from one heart rate zones to the other. I hope Samsung Health will have this simple to apply feature in the next updates."
"All of a sudden you are requiring me to give the app permission to manage and make phone calls, I agree with others, NOT HAPPENING! Enough is enough, I won't be using this app any longer! Your scripted response means nothing, that permission was NOT necessary during the initial installation, if it had been, it would NOT have been necessary to force it's approval through this update! Apps are continuously forcing those that use them to permit more and more invasive permissions."
"This was by far my favourite app, that is until they removed the one feature that tied everything together: the calorie counter. What is the point? Your app had THE one feature that made it better than all others and you removed it. And to think that I was just about to upgrade and get the watch..."
"I have had 2 other Samsung Phones with this app...and I have loved it! However, I got the new Samsung 10+ and have had nothing but trouble with this app. When I set it for a Run/Walk or Cycling it keeps pausing even though I'm still moving! I have taken the app off my phone waited a day and re-installed it...but alas it continues to malfunction! Can you help me with this?"
"App no longer syncs with my phone although it says it has synced. I removed the app and reinstalled it, now it tries to get me to setup 2FA but when it asked for my password I get the error ‚ÄúERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED‚Äù I then tried to reset my password but it won't let me include any password saying ""Can't include more than 3 repeated or consecutive character in your password."" even though the password doesnt include any repeating characters. So, I give up!"
"The app is helpful, but the profile section should have more selections for gender. I personally find it difficult which one of the two options to select due to hormone replacent therapy changing my chemical complex. I think that there should be an option to have a Transgender option to accommodate for health changes that are undergone during transitioning."
Im disappointed that i cannot track my steps counted from my watch anymore. I can only see mobile phone or all. And its complete bs that the stress tracker function isnt available in Canada. Im pretty sure the watch wasnt any cheaper than in America yet i get fewer features. Disappointing
"The latest update broke the Sleep record capability. I enter the times, but the app just igmores me and makes up its own. I also don't know why the app needs access to make phone calls, and you can't deny or the app won't open. And please give the ability to dismiss challenges that I doubt want to participate in, rather than making me scroll by it every single time. New features seem driven by Samsung and sponsors rather than users."
"Love it so far after switching from fitbit after 4 years. One issue is the myfitnesspal integration isn't great and duplicate foods/exercises happen occasionally, I also have to accept all permissions for anything to work and I didn't want to enable every permission for the integration."
"Samsung Health is a good app to track fitness activities. I use it for Step count, Weight tracking, Sleep timing and Heart rate. One suggestion for developers that in Sleep Timing, there should be options of recording sleep timing more than once a day. It means if a person has to take sleep in parts (due to any reason), he should still be able to record his hours of sleep during the day. It will benefit a lot of people who have this experience."
"I have been using the app with my GearS3. After the latest update, the fitness programs are no longer available on the app. Without the great range of workout programs which used to be there, the app now is bland and uninteresting. In place of the program I see videos. If I wanted to watch videos I would go to youtube directly rather than you show me youtube videos"
I bought the galaxy watch 3 expecting to see SP02 and ECG/BP functionality to be added to the app when I did and nothing. No mention of either of those features on the watch or in the app. Searched high and low for a solution but nothing - no clue as to why there are none of these functions on here - all web articles say the updates have already rolled out and the watch and app are up-to-date.
"I love this app. It is not perfect but suits me well. I wish it were possible to edit or delete custom foods added to My Foods. I also wish it were possible to designate a time for a food eaten outside of the default 3 meals and 3 snacks. Edited 4/28/2021: The food section has changed. Now there is only one section for snack, which would be okay if a time could be entered for each snack instead of for the whole section. ARGH!"
"I bought a weight scale just because it was on the compatible accessories list in S Health. It's a A&D scale UC-352BLE and it will not connect to Samsung Health. There a plenty more affordable scales, but since is was ""compatible"" with SH I paid the $20 more. Which now seems like a waste. Then I was chatting with Samsung Support yesterday & they told me to reset my phone settings. This caused my phone to restart. I provided my email incase we get disconnected, but of course they left me hanging."
"Right now the apps useless. Before last night this had a great layout with large options for each meal and now it doesn't even tell you how many grams you've taken in each day it shows a useless bar with no values in it for each sub section, protein, sodium, vitamin intake etc. Is there no option to change this back to how it was? If not I'm jumping to another app. Really sad you changed what was great about this app and ruined it. Don't fix what doesn't need fixing!!"
"I literally see this app falling apart in front of my face. Looking for a whole new app now. Nothing works, they take stupid things out like caffeine tracking (important to a lot of people), but now during a pandemic, we cannot log our oxygen levels, stress test gone, no more heart beat, what's left? There is only exercise and food. OK. Great. But a lot want to track their health too and have a history to look at, especially now. Whats the deal! Signed, about to leave Samsung products now too."
"So with the latest update my sleep data is no longer tracked. It is expected I enter what time I fall asleep & wake up. This is ridiculous. Sure, I can buy the newest version of this watch, but why should I? Mine is 2 years old & works fine. Why on earth would you update an app that takes away features from a product that isn't that old? I cannot & will not recommend this watch any longer. The app offers less than many other health trackers-and I have had many since their inception."
"I have to agree with other reviews. The so called ""upgrades"" have made the app less user friendly and the removal of features such as the SP02 monitor makes it less useful. The original features and interface were much better."
"So I like this app alot, my only thing i wish it did is track my sugar and and vitamins dor the day. And maybe have the option to have reminder notifications to drink more water. Or to limit salt because I've eaten a lot already. Stuff like that would make it more helpful. Also if it could scan the bar codes of food that would make life so much easier. Nevertheless I'm thankful for it! It really helps."
"So far I just started using this app and am not encouraged to keep using it. The main issue is the notification clutter. Why can I not clear notifications? I do NOT want to disable them, before you offer that advice. Just clear them. The ""deliver quietly"" option just turns off the sound but I want to be able to swipe then away if I'm not using the app at that time, like literally every other app that exists."
"I have never been more motivated to do something I love doing anyways (walking) while using an app, as I have with this one. The UI is incredibly friendly AND simply enjoy seeing others from around the world doing the same. I've never recommended an app as I have this one. Kudos developers, well done. üëç"
Just been using it for 3 days. It's a good to use app and really like the options provided for tracking various activities. However I have been facing issues in syncing the step counts from my watch to the app. The app doesn't count all the steps recorded by the watch
"Best ""health"" app out there. Is easy to use and a lot of fun taking part in competitions, challenge your friends still needs improvement on using the watch. But as a phone app absolutely AMAZING (at least on a Samsung phone, mine is Samsung galaxy S8+) I hope u will get to read it, Apple is going so much into the Health sector, maybe Samsung should have a look and don't fall behind. This step competition can be made based on a Samsung Health coin base program, have a look on Facebook Libra coin."
"- Why on earth does the app now need access to my phone calls? - I can't log in anymore. The two-step verification sends me in circles, even when I put in the verification code. - I hate all the changes from the last couple updates. The app was better as it was. Can't wait to switch away from Samsung."
"A handy app with many helpful features, however it has recently developed a troublesome hitch when I'm running. Specifically it keeps pausing my workout every few hundred metres. This is most annoying, causing me to lose time as I fiddle with my arm strap to get at my phone so I can 'resume' workout."
"I really enjoyed the app before but with the latest UPDATE, the weight control option has gone. I used this option for more than 2 years now and have managed to keep track of my weight control plan. This is a real disappointment. Now I 'll have to switch to other apps :("
"Since the last update, the O2 saturation measurement (which has been dumped into the stress measurement) no longer functions. Every time I try it, the app crashes completely. But, I guess it shouldn't surprise me from a company who refuses to provide system updates past two years on flagship phones ($700-1200). Get it together Samsung, as you've turned a huge fan into someone who will never buy another phone from you."
"Disappointing changes and direction. This app used to be ""the best"" all around fitness/health tracking app I knew of. So often now Samsung is heading in the wrong direction, removing features for no apparent reason (caffeine tracking, weight management) and making you use the Samsung Version instead of having a choice (can't use google assistant on Samsung watch). I used to always buy Samsung and Health was a big part of that, now I am considering a different company for my next device."
"The App so far works as advertised on my Galaxy 21+, except for one glaring omission. I gave it 3 stars because the app does not keep track of distances using miles or kilometers for more than a day (anything but steps please). The feature scarce LG health app does this, and Google fit does it. Seems strange that the #1 health app can't track total distance per exercise type for a week, a month or a year. So, LG Health sticks around, using valuable memory, for one important feature."
Used this app daily. Until update. Your two step verification is broke. Reinstalled twice. Every time give permissions. Get code in text. Type it in. But you can't verify it. The option is grayed out. Go back and say no to two step. It bombs and throws an error. Looks like uninstalling for good. Shoulda known when my S9 died at a year that Samsung was going downhill.
"Its a great app seriously, but there's 1 workout that most of the people's need including me is the jump rope workout, almost all of us need this workout in the galaxy watch or active, we can't use it in the phone all the time, please just consider to put it in the smartwatch. Thanks,"
"I got it just to track steps for Step Bets at first. But it's proven to be so much more! Tracks calories, stress levels, heart rate, water and coffee intake... if your looking to lose weight this isn't for you. But if you're looking to maintain, it's PERFECT!"
"Do not update to the latest version! Awful design, everything is oversized. I didn't use much of its features, but as someone said since last update, it has sign in, and then forever waiting. Their answer is as usual ""clear cashe, blah, blah"" Why do I need to mess up with the app? Samsung ruined all their apps. First on the list was Smart things (all devices on my list can't be connected after udate) about a year ago, and after that one, all Samsung updated apps are worth 0"
"The great app helps me to stay in shape and challenges me. It used to be much better when everything used to work, the GPS tracker is now toast since some software changes were made. Only workable if you can get into the programming portion of the app you might restore functionality."
"very bad, I tried to sign in in my account ,but it shows the wrong email and after uninstall the app and erase the history on Google and install Samsung's health again still same email ,and not give me the option to choose the right one.. very disappointed. i had an samsung account, but the app doesn't allow me to change the email entered for log in."
"Good app that does what it says on the tin... but no longer works! according to android debug bridge... error is 'illegal argument exception: unknown colour', relating to the class shealth.home.banner.dispatchOnBannerChanged (Banner.java:576). on a Samsung phone, I would expect their own app to work, but apparently it wasn't tested! UPDATE: After Device Health Services (Android System Service) updated, the issue is now resolved. This app works normally again."
"This app is great. It's kept me motivated...FOR YEARS! Don't listen to the worrywarts in the reviews about the permissions. The app lets you track your runs/rides and has step challenges with friends who it lets you invite via text- which is why it asks for GPS and phone permissions.. Plus- the app is owned by Samsung, so chances are they already have access to that data anyways if you have a samsung phone lmao. Not sure what these people are worried about. The app is great. It just told me today that I've logged a total of 400 running miles in the app- which was so cool to see! My only wish is that they implemented some sort of Spotify Wrapped kind of thing that would give cool analytics at the end of each year to show me all I've accomplished."
"I used to use this app all the time on my s9, but since my upgrade to the s20 plus the app no longer has the oxygen and heart rate monitor. At a time during the pandemic this is a most useful feature to have. Many people are asking for it online, please add it back. I'd like to give it more than 5 stars, but how can I when it's missing the features we want. Thanks."
"On my other Samsung Galaxy phone, Samsung S6 had the heart rate monitor which I can keep a track of my heart rate when I am out or indoors but on the Samsung A5 doesn't have that feature ever since the Samsung Health update their app. I wish Samsung Health can add this feature onto their app, so I can use it again for the future. I still cannot add the heart rate at all especially when I just updated the app again to see if they had added it yet but no they have not done that. Please add this"
"So today April 18,2021 , I was trying to access the app but it didn't allow me until I give them access to phone contacts. I did not want to do that but there was no option to skip that. When I finally opened the app, I wanted to access my personal info (not challenges). Again it didn't allow me to do that until I sync all my contacts to add as friends to challenges. MY CONTACTS ARE NOT MY ACTUAL FRIENDS AND I DO NOT WANT TO CHALLENGE THEM . This is a complete breach of privacy. üò°"
"This is great so far. Feature Request: Please make it possible to allow viewing of different running stats as graphs where we can compare the historic trend. Similar to how we can see for heart rate, daily steps, distance, etc etc. Basically I was trying to see the historic trend of my VO2Max but realise there is no way.this should be fairly easy to implement I believe."
Latest update ruins the experience for me. I've been using the app since 2015 with no issue and now many of the features have been removed since the latest update. If only you could revert to the previous update to get previous features back. I would love to speak to the lead developers to find out why they have removed these features. It feels like I've also lost my whole history stored on Samsung health and the progress I have made. Is there a way to revert?
"Hello Team, I am using Oppo Reno 5G pro and I have samsung Active2 Smart watch. I am unable to open Samsung Health Application in oppo Reno 5G pro when I click on sign in and asking for mobile number i have entered my mobile number and click on continue again it's asking me for sign in this happen last one week that I am facing the problem. I oppo Reno5G pro the OS version is 12.1 colorOS Request you to assist please ans rectifying this issu asap."
"I used to love this app, but I was very disappointed to learn that the O2 measurement has disappeared from it!!! ....it used to be available as a standalone feature, and then was bundled into ""stress measurement ""....and now even that stress measurement is gone!!! ...I have a S9+ and latest Android, so if there is a way to have that tool back, I will give it a better rating again....but now I'm very disappointed that it has dissapeared."
"Your update eliminating the pulse and O2 individual reading, and combining with stress test is disappointing. Used to be able to get those readings during a workout, now I can't. Stress Test is to delicate, touchy to get those readings. Also saving individual data. Should have asked more users before you changed it."
Used to be so great! Could separate each snack and record everything very easily. But now it's all muddled up and keeps getting less and less useful with each update. I never write reviews but this just disappointed me too much not to.
This was my favourite health and fitness app until the recent update. It was once super easy to use and displayed everything I wanted to see. It's so annoying having to hunt around just to find the macro numbers and vitamin & nutrient scores. Takes way longer to punch in my meals and only gives you 4 now.
"this was a great app until my phone updated, now only randomly records my walking distance, misses out complete days, totally inaccurate on distance and times (I walk the same 5 mile route every day so I know it's not 3.14 miles as the app tries to say and I know I didn't stop walking after 40 minutes as the app also tries to say!!) totally disappointing!! (tried rebooting my phone, still just as rubbish!) thanks for your reply but im hardly going to phone that number from the UK ü§î"
"I'm changing my review. I originally gave this app a 4 star review because it was working really well. Now all of a sudden, my Samsung Galaxy fit will have recorded my sleep and my stress levels during the day(stress) and night(sleep) but the Samsung Health app is not showing any of those recording since Monday night. I like to know how I slept because I know I have trouble sleeping and I would like to know my stress level during the day because I deal with anxiety."
"I'm using this with a S9/Galaxy Active Watch. These work great when recording steps or exercises when I have them in me. However when I want to add exercises manually, it doesn't convert to steps so, while I get the 'yay you exercised' message and the relevant active time, I don't get the benefit of reaching or exceeding ny step count. Am I doing something wrong?"
"The reason I gave this app one less star is that they took away the meter that tells you if you are below or, within, or above your daily calorie goal (blue, green and red respectively) . This really helped me lose weight so I was disappointed that the major update took it out."
"The app it self is great, and I love the diffrent combined functions and overal functionality, however.. I noticed that with my lately extra focus on exercise I was slowly losing weight. As soon as I start seeing my ribs I know it's time to ramp up the calories. My information is in the app. The app recommended me around 1400 calories, which would lead to severe weightloss. Its that I know this is too low for me, but this could be very dangerous. BMI is slightly underweight. Please change"
"it did help me manage myself with my excercises and was able to lose 10 pounds of fat. It is the only one that has the most integration, heart rate sensor usability, and linking with some healthcare. Overall its accuracy and truthfulness is what I like best"
"Don't get me wrong it's an excellent app. Just not what I needed. It tracks everything you would want it to truck, but I can be up on my feet moving around all day long and it says I've only been active for 6 minutes. WHAT? I am an elderly person with medical problems. I can't achieve the goals they set and there is no setting for an elderly person. I really wanted what's a parameter to keep track of how far I walk. But for younger people it would be a great great app to have."
"Earlier the app was amazing all the features made it one of the best fitness trackers available. But now, features like: 1. Weight Management 2. Calorie Counters To name a few are gone. They were honestly the best features of the app. Samsung please bring back these features. A lot of people will be happy."
"Needs generic weightlifting option! I like the app alright, especially since it works well with the galaxy watch, but it drives me crazy that there isn't an exercise for just ""weightlifting"". I have to either select each individual exersize or enter a workout as ""other""."
"Update has rolled it backwards. Come on Samsung, where is the weight management tab? Phone automatically updated to this version and now its gone! Bring it back. Up till now this was one of the most comprehensive apps I have seen to monitor and manage my health in one place... now? You are actually hindering me losing weight and getting healthy!"
"This app tells me it cannot run on my phone because my phone is rooted. However, my phone has NEVER been rooted, or had any unofficial software on it. Knox flag is untripped - it shows a value of 0. My device status is listed as Samsung Official, and Play Store shows my device is certified. None of my other apps have this issue. How does Samsung Health check my device for root? Whatever method, it is failing, because it has prevented me from using an app I should be able to. Very disappointed."
"The app will not display the steps from my Samsung Active watch only. All steps (mobile and watch) or mobile only are the two options I have in the app. I only want to see the steps from my watch in the app. I have called customer service twice and after lengthy troubleshooting by phone, no resolution. I was promised a call back which never happened"
"Used it for well over a year. This last update caused it to stop. Wants me to sign in with new two step verification. Enter phone # and it goes back to verification. Tried to uninstall knowing I would lose all my data. Still didn't work. Galaxy 8. Reentered phone # got code but still just sends be back to verification. Developer -. If you read above I say it sent me a code, I entered it and it just takes me back into the two step verification loop. Please pay attention before responding!"
Sleep not being sent from watch. Had to be from a recent update. The watch sometimes doesn't send the sleep recording to the app. It does show that it recorded it on the watch. This has happened a few times in the past 2 ish weeks. At least that is when I began to notice.
"Update: 5 Stars: With the return of trackable SpO2 levels, this app now meets all my daily/hourly tracking needs. Original: 1Star: I was quite happy until trackable Oxygen Saturation levels were removed. Even though it can be measured with the ""stress"" tracker, it can not be displayed as a historic graph. Please bring back Oxygen Saturation as a seperate, trackable item."
"Honestly, BEST health app I've tried. I struggle with weight loss and nutrition, and this app has been a needle in a haystack. Its FREE, it tracks your food intake, your water, your average sleep, your STRESS?!?! If you're on your path to lose weight, balance out your diet, do exercise, or even just flat out become healthier, this is the app for you. It has lots of helpful articles and references to relevant information, lots of intel on what you need to change to become healthy for FREE!"
LOVE the app and how it is paired with my Galaxy watch! I do wish some of the mindfulness features are free like a sleep music sound at least one for free. I was a Beta tester and I loved the app when I was testing it! Please add a little more free stuff though? edit: I just saw on 8/6/19 a lot more sleep music is available thank you!
"I've used this app since last year. I always have the step count in the notification bar so I don't have to keep going into the app just to see how many steps I've done. Now, the notification keeps saying that it's updating, which really pisses me off."
"The app is ok, but the fact that you can't add a workout after you are done with it is super annoying. I do weigh workouts followed by a boxing session, I don't like to have to keep pausing the workouts on my phone and then switching them."
"Edit: I received the same canned response as most other reviewers since this update. The response is not helpful or reassuring in any way. I do not care about what health thinks is optimal, I want the choice. Fix the forced permissions! You do not need contact access, phone access, camera access, or storage access to count my steps. You ruined a fine app by being greedy. Return to how things were. I hate needing third party apps, but your change is forcing me to use another non-samsung option."
Loved tracking steps throughout the day and simply clicking the walking figure to track distance and speed on a walk. Unfortunately they updated the privacy agreement and you can no longer agree without also agreeing to let the app make phone calls. Lost all my data for 3+ yrs totally pointless overreach.
"What the freak. I used this app in my other phone and it was nice. i counted water,steps and also did exercises using the health programmes. But when I changed my phone,I had no sim so when I opened this app,it is just not working. Well,atleast give an option to sign up without a sim card. I would have given 0 stars but that is not an option. In one word: Disappointed!!"
"Why does it need all of those permissions? I can't even use the app. It keeps telling me the app won't work without the permissions. I just want to count my steps. There's no reason for the phone, contacts, camera, location, etc permissions. The only permissions it needs are the physical and body sensors. Good job, you guys ruined the app. I remember when it wasn't like this."
"I would have given this at many more stars, except they recently had an update and they took weight management away. one of the best features. So now you can count your steps and monitor your training and exercise, but as far as weight management they've taken that away. what good is one without the other?"
"This new version no longer connects with ANT+ monitors (all the other apps on my Galaxy phone still connect without any problems). Samsung answered that one must report the issue from inside the app using my cell phone. Just finished doing as requested. As the problem is solely a Samsung Health problem on a Samsung Galaxy 20 cell phone, let's see if they're able to fix this problem."
"Sorry but this app sucks for recording meals. Food that is listed doesn't match the ingredients on the packages of the foods. And then when the grams match the percents are way different even though the app says it is based on a 2000 calorie diet same as the nutrition facts on the packages. Also the app only allows 4 different vitamins to be recorded. You cannot record or add them at all. For example It does not allow or record for vitamins D, E, any of the B's, no zinc, no magnesium, etc."
Pretty good for tracking my steps and my blood pressure which I didn't know existed! I've been recording my blood pressure manually! I also downloaded another app that syncs with Samsung health for water drink reminder which I wish Samsung had instead of downloading another phone app. I don't track what I eat using Samsung health but I use baritastic which I don't know if it can sync to Samsung health. I wish it did so I can see everything in one app hence the 4 star only.
"I keep getting this error every time I open the app. ""Cant set up the app This service is temporarily unavailable. Try again later. ( 0x700010) "" I havent even been able to set it up. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling, as well as erasing all its cache ..is this a problem on my A70 only ?"
Resting heart rate rarely shows and when it does it is EXTREMELY inaccurate!!
"Was an amazing app; I used it for years. When the recent updates came, it didn't track steps correctly..I would walk/jog etc for miles and it would only count a few steps. I tried multiple troubleshooting methods suggested but they didn't work."
"Unfortunately, the food diary has very incorrect and incomplete information. Otherwise, very easy to use and I like the charts it uses to give visuals on nutrient intake. Would be nice if the nutrients were accurate."
Draining battery. I have a samsung note 8 and just recently the phone keeps flagging this app for high battery usage and I can't make it through an 8 hour day without needing to charge my phone which was not an issue before the high battery usage. I already uninstalled and reinstalled the app but it didn't fix the problem. I really hate to completely uninstall the app but I hate having to charge my phone 2 to 3 times a day now. Anyone else having these issues?
Since my Samsung galaxy phone update this app won't work and crashes the wearable app. My Samsung watch won't pair. Had to delete both apps and add them back then had to delete all info on watch to get it to pair. Nothing like having to start every thing over. For the price you charge you would think you could figure out the updates so they don't break the other Samsung apps üôÑ
"I use this app every day and just recently bought a active 2 watch. The feature I really liked was removed with the new update. The weight management option so I could see my calorie expenditures vs calorie intake. Now its just a step counter, which I can use fitbit for. Very disappointed."
This app no longer monitors steps. Cleared the cache as advised. Did not help. Uninstaller and re-installed did not help. S3 synch my exercise routine perfecly just not my steps. If I activate walking on the S3 then it will synch. When trying to synch steps there is no longer an option for S3 only options are mobile or all! Please check you update for compatibility to Huwaie P20. Worked perfectly. Before update! Thanks guys - love the app
"Brilliant app, coupled with the smart watch means you keep track of all your movements. The only thing it lacks is a scan facility for logging your food intake, sometimes it takes longer to find the food products that it does to eat them."
"WHY DID THE UPDATE MAKE THE PRINT SO SMALL!!! Seriously, this is ridiculous. There are many people who have vision issues who need the option for larger text. ADD THAT BACK IN! FYI: SAMSUNG you need to read all these reviews since the last updates. Roll those updates back. Almost every review is negative. Lost functionality. Tiny print. Not user friendly. Obviously it is a very bad change."
"I am interested in downloading this app again, but w/ the new changes and the feedback I am learning from other users...not sure if it's the right time to download. Maybe when the issues of updates that were done in earlier 2021 are rectified and caffeine and other items are considered I might try. I really would like to and then buy galaxy watch. Side note, ads don't bother me so much because the company needs to make revenue. But third party advertiser tracking and selling my data does."
"I love using Samsung Health but recently the app is not working correctly. Can you direct me to finding some support? My issue is regardless of the exercise chosen that has pause, the app pauses. If I turn pause off, the app crashes. Thanks in advance for your reply."
"Unable to sign on to app. Tried force stop and cleared cache, as recommended. App developers what is going on? Update: called customer service as recommended. Followed the steps given to me. Was told to call back if the fix didn't work. App still does not load. Give me a break. How about fixing the app so users don't have to jump through hoops to get it to load? Help!"
"It was a breeze to use the apps until I updated it earlier today. Now my nickname in profile went missing & I don't seem to be able to update it. On top of that, I can't even check the latest steps for together challenge. Nothing seems to be happening even when I tapped on it."
"Great! This app has helped me stay on track with my weight loss, it has been awesome! The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because I wish there was a female health feature to help track menstruation. It would be a wonderful feature to add and would be beneficial to many users!"
"Would give 5, but when you enter manual walking, you can't enter steps, just distance. It needs to allow steps as an entry compute distance, or provide steps as part of the entry that as an option and compute the distance. Just does not make sense in my mind that entering steps is NOT part of the screen entry."
"Good app but the food tracker does not consider keto diets and warns me about fat levels being high. It also does not mention all the various vitamins and minerals and only focuses on a few so the information is incomplete. As part of my s10 plus flagship phone at the time of.purchase, I expect the Samsung apps to be perfected."
"Overall it's a good app, but you need to work on exercise section - a lot of options are missing (there's no ski touring; in the altitude graph the x axis MUST be distance, not time; it doesn't count ski runs in downhill skiing; gpx export isn't always available for some reason; you can't zoom in on the graphs to see details; etc.)"
"I must say that after upgrading from the S8 to S10 I was very disappointed to see that half the things from this app have been deleted. I was pleased to see the mindfulness part till seeing you had to pay for Calm. I use another app which is cheaper but just as good so will be sticking to that. Was also hoping to invest in a watch at some point. But after seeing someone else review that the watch has no benefits, with health app as it is. Happy to continue life without one"
"New update is terrible for tracking steps! If I take less than 30 steps it does not count them. Also, there is no more 'refresh' option to make sure it's manually synced. I wish they would bring it back as it was a very good app before."
Something very wrong with app. Especially when it says I walked 39 miles/85561 steps between 1200 am and 10am which is impossible because I was in bed sleeping. Never accurate. It also counts steps while charging. Definitely going to fins a different app to use. This one is just terrible
"Good to track steps, but I find the combo of phone & watch gives more steps than watch alone (even if phone has been with me the whole way). Good choice of workouts to log. Running app good with different choice of workouts & guides you to slow down/speed up. More treadmill workouts pls. Calorie counter v.difficult to use as geared for US market. I cook at home a lot but can't add my own recipes as I don't know how many cals they are. Few Malaysian foods so can't track when eat out."
"Great app, love that i can track all my stats and works really well with my gear 2. As far as features, is there any chance we can have body fat % added to the fitness stats we can track? Also maybe in some of the workouts listed, actually have an option to allow the app to tell you what you should do for that workout ie. Yoga poses and stretches. Update:18-3-21: There seems to have been an update and now i'm unable to input a workout manually, some workouts i need to take my watch off or the watch just doesn't pick it up, so how am i supposed to record a session it's missed now?"
"So frustrating. I have to hit 5 things to get it to record steps for example and then about 10% of the time, it records for 2 seconds and stops. So disappointing when you finish your walk and it didn't even start."
Did not keep accurate track. Off by 1000s of steps. Many many times.
"Disappointing update! Extremely disappointed in the latest update! The best features have been removed. Why have you taken away the calorie and floor information. I've been using the Samsung active watch for years now and am now looking at other fitness watches. The point of a fitness tracker is to track fitness, by removing these features it seems pointless!!"
"Just bought the samsung watch4 and I am very disappointed as the ecg and blood pressure dont work. The reason is 1st of all unavailability at my region (EU) but i think is bug of the apps The health app does not sync with samsung health monitor; i tried also to add apps with data permissions - this doesnt work at all on samsung health it just says no apps to add even if there was an app pending ""permission"". That is just frustrating and obviously a bug that has to be fixed."
"I thought this Samsung Health was cool and could help me out in counting my healthy activities. But it was only good as when my cellphone was newly issued. All auto readings were stopped after 3 months!!! And I received a ""stop usage"" message duh! Why have this feature when it won't work after long...well why have this phone anyway. Truly frustrating."
"I have been using Samsung Health for many years with no problems...was GREAT APP! LAST UPDATE (08302021) changed that. Can only use STEPS and NOTHING ELSE! I have been using my NOTE 9 running Android 9. for the last 3 years with no problem until last update. Please fix the last update so I can monitor heart rate, Sp02, exercise time, etc. Thanks"
"New permissions suck. The reason for unnecessary permissions are unclear. To use the app we must give access to phone calls, contacts, location, camera. SO MANY! What's strange is that once you've installed it, you can then turn these permissions off. Re-downloaded to check if Samsung had changed these permissions but NO...will be deleting again"
I like having data immediately. Only thing I don't like is while water lock is on not being able to use volumin up or down. I have owned a fitbit versa and the first year was sent back 4x and the charger 2x...and the older ones had black out screen issues too. The Samsung this far has been great üëç
I use the app to track my sleep. It gives a useful graph but the only problem I have is that I cannot manually change my sleep time. It gives the option but the save button doesn't work. Should be a simple fix but clearly a developer screwed up. Must be a coop...
"This app was perfect for calorie/nutrition tracking, exercise tracking, etc. Ive used this app for two years and then suddenly it won't allow me to use the app because it wants access to my phone calls. Basically a perfect app, if only I could continue to use it. Unfortunately it won't stop being in use due to it being a Samsung app that cannot be Uninstalled. However it still counts my steps. Unfortunately I cannot log anything anymore due to permissions being denied. Bummer."
"The app now requires 2 step verification, however, when I type the 6 digit code it sends into the app at the correct point it doesn't allow me to verify that code. The button to do that remains blank. This is the latest of many annoying issues with this app and make my Galaxy Watch next useless. Android mobile user (and yes I have deleted and reinstalled the app, and yes, my phone OS is up to date, as is my watch)."
Good tracker but latest update dropped O2 saturation and stored data. Had to uninstall app and find previous version (6.4.0.047) online to get it back. Also uncheck auto update in App store. Don't know why they would drop that seemingly useful service from the app while leaving less important ones.
"Inconsistent with the sleep tracker. It's horrible. Some days it doesn't show you the breakdown of your sleep and recordings are off, and adding your sleep manually doesn't really work right. During a workout it doesn't register you are working out until 10 minutes in."
"Useful app overall but the step tracker isn't working properly. I used a different app on another phone and know the average steps for certain regular walks, this shows about half of them. When walking with friends it's the same, their trackers show around double the steps I get with this so no use at all if that's what you need it for"
"This app is actually really nice, but recently I haven't been able to use it because it keeps showing me a error message that the app won't open in a rooted device. But you see, the thing is: my device has never been rooted!!! I have no idea how to fix this... (my phone is a Galaxy S9)"
"I feel like Samsung is shutting down this app soon. They have been removing functionality one by one for a while now, and have not added or bettered a single thing for years. It use to be good, not anymore. I was going to buy a Galaxy Watch because I prefer to keep it all together but will look for other options now. Disappointed because I even spent extra money on another important accessory only because it can be regiater to Samsung health app, after it registers thats it, it does nothing!"
"I enjoy tracking my steps and participating in the monthly challenges. Useful for tracking various things like heartbeat (useful for me in performance analysis), sleeping, steps, amongst other things. I also like how the tracking on my Galaxy watch integrates smoothly with the app."
"I use this app all the time...every morning I run about 2 miles on treadmill. I have my phone connected to my Samsung gear s4 using the Samsung health app.since update the step counter/ mile tracker is Way off. Example. It showed I took 2,600 steps but said I only went 0.49 miles. Which is wrong. It should be at least 1.6 miles(running). This is a major demotivator for me in the mornings. I have made sure system has updated for phone, watch and current version of app an watch is on snug."
"Samsung Health along with my Galaxy Active 2 watch has helped me be more mindful of my habits. I am encouraged to get up and walk more with the steps tracker and I am reminded when I should stretch or move more at work. The food journal option is great for tracking what you eat, how much you eat and when you eat to help you figure out healthy or nonhealthy trends. I would recommend this app to those who want to develop healthier habits."
I had the app on my previous phone for years. It was a great tool to help with staying active and tracking my health. I got a new phone and was looking to install app again. After reading these reviews I've decided to not install and instead wait and see if Samsung fixes all these update problems.
"I have used and loved this app for years. Since my run on 9/2/19, I have lost mileage. I run the same route and know where my half mile markers are. I haven't been feeling well so originally I thought I flat out missed a loop. I'm also somehow now running over 10:30 per mile. No way. I know I'm not feeling well, but c'mon. I read another review with the same exact issues around the same time. Maybe it's TMobile's update over Labor Day weekend and now the GPS is messed up or this app?"
"Its very useful app for tracking your health, everything is fine but I noticed one bug when its not showing proper steps taken sometimes. I have amazfit Smart watch. When I start my activity like jogging, smart watch showing fine but Samsung health app not showing proper count. For instance Smart watch showing 5000 steps but app showing just 1200. Please fix this."
I've always loved this app but it stopped counting my steps about a month ago. Gutted. Also I've had several issues with the phone overall. Virgin mobile technical are useless when I phoned them. This is comfortably the worst phone I've ever had!
"I just paid ¬£290 for a watch but almost every fitness programme is behind a paywall. Very greedy. If you want to charge for the service, subsidise the watch to ¬£100. I'm not paying for both. Also, why are there adverts for the watch that I have connected? And why can't I search for a program? Finally, the sleep monitor graph is hard to interpret. This app is truly terrible - awful usability and designed solely to leverage money from people who have already paid for Samsung hardware."
"It keeps crashing after the latest update, can't measure stress level. Really annoying. Please, fix it as I can't measure oxygen saturation. The response I got is absolutely useless as I'm based in UK and can't call US phone number, I guess there was an error in your new update, which you need to correct, especially now it is vital to check your oxygen saturation if you have covid 19. Or have you done it on purpose?"
"Great app. Ive been using this since I had a Samsung. I love how I link up different workout apps to it. Count calories, and all the other things. However, when i upgrade to a new device to a S10e . I could not take blood pressure. I cant record but not take it. Still enjoying the app."
"love it! makes walking and hiking more fun, like it's some sort of side quest. Just wish people would stop making the mistake of getting an iPhone so there were more people to compete and challenge! the galaxy watch records everything for this app too so no need to take my phone running!"
"I love this app!!!! Very useful for tracking things such as your fitness, sleep, water intake, stress levels, and much more!! The monthly step challenge part of the app motivates me to keep my walking and fitness levels up. The app also offers several free workout programs!!!!"
"Frustrating! Every time my phone (or this app) updates, all my data is lost. This makes no sense to me. I have to use an external tracking app to keep track of everything because I have lost so much info over and over. The first time I thought it was just a fluke, then it happened over and over again."
I loved this app before I updated it. I can no longer access it... it has me complete the 2 step verification- when it identifies the verification code it sends itself back to the screen to send a code to my phone. It's stuck in a loop. I can no longer keep a good track of my watch stats... very disappointed
I like this app a lot. I just wish the sleep tracker was better. I wish it was more detailed. I also don't like that it doesn't track properly if I get up to use the bathroom in the night. That's really my only complaint. Everything else is great! If the sleep tracker was better I'd dive it 5‚òÜ.
"Want to use the free app you paid $1,000 for on your phone? Ads! Ads everywhere! Do not buy Samsung. They don't allow you to turn off ads. So far I've seen ads for Nutrisystem and SiriusXM. At the top of this app can be see the words ""Contains Ads"". Samsung said there aren't any ads, but they're lying and I have the screenshots to prove it."
"thanks, i really needed the o2 functionality, not for fun, for so i dont die. now ive got to go back to using a seperate device that doesnt sync to my phone for easy tracking. im also glad to see that your stupid watch and app doesnt support googlefit forcing me to use this garbage app. the generic computer response makes the situation worse."
"I loved this app, as this gives me in detail information on diet, workout, steps(while holding the phone) challenges with buddies, but the only bug is it's not connecting to my blink go band. Hence my walking steps will not match if I do not hold my phone. In accessories wen I scan , it does not search for blink go. Little disappointed here."
What on earth have you done to this app. I used to be able to review daily areas like automatic steps and now I can't. All it is showing is weekly averages which is no good to me and nothing is showing from 3 January 2021. I have to say new layout isn't as user friendly. Sorry but I used to love the old version.
Getting a bit frustrated as had to reinstall twice in past 5 days to get it to sync with my gear fit. worked fine for the first 3 months i had the watch so frustrating that this has started to happen. lose all steps counted on the day which adds to the irritation.
I really like my Samsung smart watch. Unfortunately I can't get past the 2 step verification step on the app. So I am not able to sync anything from my watch. The app won't let me approve the verification code once typed in. There is no way to get past this step. This is so frustrating. I would like to use my watch with this app. I'll be shopping for a non Samsung set up soon.
"Huawei Mate 20 Pro Android 10. Impossible for me after the last updates to login into the app. I enter my email and password then the circle animation keeps showing up forever. Tried uninstalling, restarting the phone and installing again over the course of the last months. Update : I have factory reset my phone and still does the infinite spinning circle loading thing. I am not going to call the call center to tell them the exact same thing ."
"This is a great fitness and nutrition companion. It syncs seamlessly with my Galaxy watch and every day I'm discovering new features. The nutrition tracking is actually very powerful and I generally can easily find my meal or snack listed in the search results. I am able to log my food by weight, serving or calories, which allows me to precisely track my caloric intake. Paired with my watch, I can easily forecast my caloric needs/goals. Additionally, there are a ton of workout plans with detailed instructions."
"Absolutely disappointed in Samsung Health app, the removal of weight and calorie management. This change has made things way more complicated and for me basically pointless to use the app. I might as well find a new application and quit using Samsung health altogether. I will be removing from my phone and finding something else."
"Its a fair app, my issue with it is that the nutrition provided by fat secret never lists all the nutrition that displayed on the product.. for instance I had a clementine with it lists the total fat, sodium, potassium, carbohydrates and protein but not the vitamin c, vitamin b-6, calcium or magnesium... its like that for all the items provided by fat secret. So I have to type it manually just to get the right nutrients listed so I can see if I'm getting a balanced diet."
Your new design is horrible! I used to have no problems at all navigating your site now it takes me 5 minutes to figure out where to find simple changes to my routine my workout my distance everything. The lettering is too small and not conducive to an enjoyable program for somebody to use as a workout tool
"I bought a Samsung wearable recently and ever since that I have not been able to login to Samsung Health. It is so frustrating to see the loading page everytime I try to login. I tried all the methods, clear cache, force stop, clear data, restart device and everything possible. But nothing seems to work. VERY DISAPPOINTED to see this behavior from such a huge company."
"Recently, I started noticing that my steps are not counted as it used to be earlier - 90% of the steps are ignored and Nike+ gps is also not getting locked during runs. So I did a factory reset and still observing the issue with under counting of steps. I am using S8. Help would be appreciated!"
"Latest update Jan 2021 really messed up the weight tracking. I can no longer see my weekly trends or monthly trends. I can no longer see my long term trends. Samsung Health is even more broken with the last update. Getting ready to switch to a different app altogether for health. This has become next to useless over all now. Can't easily turn off the stupid voice coach for walking either. Unless app now. Edit: .4.8.21, Since Jan 2021, the app still ruined. They do nothing to fix it."
"So far it is ok, i like the December snow walk board game they have. That was fun, more games would be nice. the nutrition log seems a little limited on what you can input for vitamins and supplements. I loathe the ads that they plaster on the top of the app. why must there be a giant ad taking up half my screen, we have the app and probably most have a Samsung watch as there would be no reason to have this app without the watch , so why are we bombarded with watch ads...."
"I love this app, but lately, I can't use it. Every time I start my exercise, it pauses after 10 seconds. I try to resume, and the same thing happens. I think it's tracking my exercise, and it paused after I started! Please fix this"
"i really love this application, it keeps me on track of my food, excercise etc. however in food logging i wish it wouldve been a timeline rather than these blocks since it would make more sense and visual understanding. After all, logging multiple food options at a specific time doesn't mean they were ate at that time simultaneously. please fix!"
"Really liked this app for tracking my steps, a friend of mine and I are competing to see who can reach Mordor first on another app so knowing how many miles i go in a day was great. Recently though ive noticed that on a walk that used to get me halfway to my step goal now only tracks a few hundred steps. I dont know what has happened but i would really like it if you could fix this issue because i havent reached my step goal according to this aop in awhile and its very inconvenient."
Application acts really weird everyday. End of day you would have made x steps and would stand a good position in leader board. On sunrise you would a very different number than one achieved on day closing. The same scenario repeats everyday and hard to find the logic behind. It was wonderful earlier and recent updates had made it worse.
"Since update pedometer often fails to register step count. After walking to work yesterday for exampe. When looking at the count it was 0 on the widget. When trying to go into app, white screen unresponsive phone for 5 minutes until android asks if I want to terminate app. Never had an issue before this downgrade!"
Update: After speaking with Samsung Support I will be returning my new galaxy watch 5. Samsung gas taken away the ability to login to Samsung Health on non Samsung phones. I am truly disappointed by this I have always been a fan of the Samsung watches however this makes them completely useless since I have a pixel. Sad I'm being forced to the land of Fitbit but my phone wins not the other way around. Doesn't work on pixel 7. It won't let me login it just spins.
"There are multiple problems with this app, if you use tredmill or walk without phone or watch, there is no option to add ur steps manually on this app for record, sometimes there is no movement as im sleeping but on waking up there are 3 4 or 5 steps recorded, i wonder where they come from, it connects to friends only from contact list and gives no options for facebook or other social media friends, orherwise it is best app ever."
"Just got my s10. I have used this app since my first Galaxy phone, before the s5. I started up the widget, signed in. All of my previous data loaded. The widget is not showing my steps on my home page, however is counting when you go into the ""select widget"" area. I tried removing from home screen and restarting widget. Still nothing on home screen but its counting on the widget selection area."
As everyone in the reviews and in online forums has mentioned. This update makes it so you can't use the app on non-samsung phones. So glad I just spent my Christmas money on a watch that I can't backup data for. Now to decide if I'm going to return it and get something I didn't like as much and cost more. Or just deal with the fact that samsung will only allow me to access 7 days of history.
Downgraded my Rating from 5 stars to 1 - The decision to remove the weight management feature drove my change in rating. This app was so comprehensive and that feature was a clear differentiator from othe apps. I withheld changing my rating hoping there was some sign of strategic change in direction that was BETTER...but it has been quite some time and no clear response to this logic. I invested in my second samsung watch and sad that I have to hodge podge solutions. Product manager help us!
"Great app for keeping track of all your various workouts and general well being. Paired with the galaxy watch it's even better, proper sleep monitoring and workout tracking which automatically record in app without even opening your phone. Only giving 4 stars, only reason being everything can be improved even if it's pretty damn good already"
This was a great app but now its not showing the amount of time that I've been running and when it says Well Done that's another workout done if 8 press finish it says unfinished. There is no way to correct it and say that the workout has been done and no way to resume and finish the last few minutes once you've pressed finish
A decent app. The only reason I haven't switched over fully is because the food logging system isn't great. No barcode scanner and every item already in the system has inaccurate information. Would love to see this updated so I can have just one health app on my phone.
"Help!!!!!!!! Ever since the update, I cann it get the app to sync data from my Galaxy 3 watch!!! My phone is counting steps separate from my watch. So annoying. I've tried disconnecting, reconnecting, rebooting, clearing cache...nothing is working!"
I like this app. But not working in one plus 8T mobiles
"Great app can be fantastic with: 1. Ability to adjust daily macronutrient percentages for fat, carbs and protein and weekly trend. 2. Ability to track net carbohydrates and overall weekly trend. 3. Ability to track net calories at end of each day and overall weekly trend. 4. Ability to input meal data for next day to plan ahead. 5. Ability to scan food barcode for meal inputs. 6. A better list of macro nutrient breakdown. 7. Track fasting periods and weekly trend"
I would give this app 5 stars if you were able to scan the barcode of the food you're eating to add it to you daily intake.
"It's nice but I wonder why in term of steps Samsung watch always combines with phone not on itself? Secondly, why Samsung tablets don't have the ability to download this app? Lastly, why the app doesn't have the ability to have two profiles at the same time? Keep up the good work x"
"Like everyone else here I have used this app for more than a year and all of a sudden I can't use it due to permissions that samsung deems to be necessary all of a sudden. I have also noticed that the response from Samsung is trying to say the permissions are only for the users optimal experience, SMH if the users seemed to enjoy the app without these added permissions then I would think that Samsung would be willing to redo the app the app to satisfy their users/customers."
"Worked great until the latest update, if you don't allow the app to access you phone calls it won't allow you to use it anymore. What a kick in the teeth, also why do I need a two step password for a fitness app. Joke. Your reply just shows how out of touch with the User you guys are now. You have ruined a really good app. I'm done with it and have found better alternatives."
"So far I like the app. But I would really like if the water intake log was more customizable. You can only choose increments of 250mL or 8.4oz for a ""glass of water"". I would like to track my total intake through the day using a 20oz/600mL water bottle. I'd really like the option to change the volume of measure so when I finish a bottle, I can log it."
"I like the new features and plans, but I would like the ability to add my own plans in. For example, start a plan, add individual exercises and lengths, and track those on the watch instead of using pre-made plans always. Why? Because I can't search or find a plan for shin splint stretches. I can't search plans easily at all actually. Rather just make my own."
"For some reason the gps is so out to lunch. My Samsung gear fit pro works well for gps but if I just use the Samsung health app it says I've done 8km run when only I've done 5 and an average 5min/km which looks awesome, but absolutely impossible. Does that because of the inflated km's. Do not like the new design either of the app. Back to map my run I guess. Glad my watch includes this app now."
This app was great until the update. My step counter is freezing now and not tracking my steps properly. It starts and stops multiple times no matter how far you go. I measured and I am on average missing a thousand steps per day. Wish they would fix the freezing. Other than that it's a good ap.
"latest update accuses me of rooting my phone and pops up every 30-60 seconds. says it can't run on a rooted phone... my phone had never been ripped. popped up 8 times writing this... resolution is needed ASAP or else I'm disabling all my Samsung apps. even when the app is closed and not in use, it pops up anyway."
I am definitely not a fan of the new updateüòï Especially the sleep records. I can't see the actual time patterns for the sleep history. And the little pop up box is only visible when touching it. I'm actually considering other options...a different brand.
"LOVE the sleep tracker! I'm a HORRIBLE sleeper and this helps to let me know, exactly how bad my sleep patterns are! I really do love my Samsung Active 2 watch. I bought it at Costco and I've had no problems with it. I can't understand why so many people have problems with the watch. The only thing I can think of, is they may not be technologically adept. In that case, YouTube is your friend and you can watch ""how to"" videos to help you set up and understand your watch better ü§ó"
"I generally like this but am frustrated that i can't find where to change the app notifications. Everything I've tried doesnt give me an option to change the tone, only to turn the notifications off. I still want to SEE them, just not have them interupting my day constantly."
This is a very useful and helpful app. It packs wide range of features in a small size. I just hoped in it's next update i will install fasting tracker feature. It will make it much more helpful without having to depend upon other apps.
"""Starting with version 6.5, oxygen saturation (SpO‚ÇÇ) measurement will no longer be provided as its own function"". That functionality was what I used this app for, and they increased the steps needed to access it. As it's now bundled together with the ""stress tracker"", it now takes more time to get a reading. Poor design choice especially considering this day and age..."
"With high expectations I purchased samsung galaxy fit band,thinking they will support for indoor runs (very much needed during this covid time) ,it has trademill option but doesn't calculate distance based on stride length, samsung health to strava sync is very slow it seems and not sure if this really happens , more than 12 hours is passed but my data is not synced to strava,there should be sync to strava button. Very disappointed. Cheaper MI Band with Notify and fitness has all these options"
Love it takes my blood pressure takes my heartbeat per minute takes my stress level and reads it all to me on the app many more things also
it is a good application for tracking fitness. But it will be more useful if the developer add a regular bath time and how many times a person need to to go to the washroom or toilet. Developers should also be added a bar where people can write their life event like sad moment or happy moment and many more. Please solve this issues and make a new version of Samsung health. Thank you to all developers for making a such kind of useful application.
"I love this app. When there is an issue with design or performance, the devs respond and work to resolve it."
Excellent apps for keep your health up...
"I really enjoy this app, but I think it also needs to include the menstrual cycle. A person's cycle plays an important role in their health. Someone in the middle of their menstrual cycle is not going to have the same health as someone at the end. Without it I think there's a missing variable that provides important insight. Great work so far!"
"It would be a good app if it would let me edit my sleep when my watch logged a movie as me sleeping, or if I could manually add an exercise since my Galaxy Watch Active2 cannot pick up when I exercise EVER. But since those are the main things I track on the app without them it's useless. If Fitbit made it possible to text and receive calls I would've stuck with them as their wearable and app work better."
"Works ok with my Samsung Note. Installed on my Xiaomi, no problem, but then I tried to log in to sync my data, then some odd language in a very unfamiliar writing pop up asking me to fill in my details and of course I cannot do it because I could not understand a single letter of it. Reply - what number to call in the UK? Even better if there is email contact to send the snapshot of the random language use in Samsung health sign in page"
"I used to use this app to help me with my with goals, but without the weight management widget it's hardly worth my time. This is especially frustrating because I even have the Samsung watch to track my activity but now I can't see a comparison of my burned calories to what I've eaten. Very frustrated with this update."
They change (move/remove) features so much its hard to rely on any consistent tracking. I'm probably going to dump the whole samsung eco system. The contact info is useless. I tried reaching out via the app first. The phone number suport just tells you to use another app for things they removed.
I noticed sinced October 2018 the step is not counted anymore and it saying cant remove default tracker. I tried to uninstall and install but still the same. Is there anything wrong with the apps or do I need to do something in he settings. The instruction to clear the cache does not work and still show the can't remove default tracker.
"with the latest update, the app stops reading the distance while running, once the screen gets locked. I have tried all settings but it keeps happening. This was not the case with older version. Couldnt understand the reason yet."
"Registration on the app was  frustrating: The password confirmation kept saying ""Password does not match' . This was not true as my preferred password included a '+'  (Special character}  bu tthere was no warning there. There is also no ""view"" button to verify my password.   Please consider allowing special characters and changing this page to state the true reason for password failure. Thanks"
This app is absolutely amazing. It pretty much has everything which means that it is all in the same place. One thing that might the calorie/food tracker a lot easier to use is a barcode scanner but other than that its awesome and the developers seem to actually listen to your opinions and suggestions
"The app is not working any more after the latest Security update pushed to my S8+ on July 6 2019. I have cleared data, cache, uninstalled and reinstalled the app. Nothing is working..  Can't Open app Unauthorized changes where made to your phone. Contact customer service for more information.  Update: I called the number provided and still the issue is not resolved despite following the steps given by the person on the phone."
"My husband and I both used this app and really liked it but then Samsung changed it and REQUIRES the ability to manage my phone calls or the app won't function. For what purpose?! I unistalled it immediately. Neither me nor my husband used the ""Together"" feature and we should've been able to opt out of the phone access as opposed to the app not working unless access is granted. Samsung is just collecting more personal information. Who are they selling it to and for how much money?"
"I got a samsung watch active 2 couple of days back and trying to get it work with the samsung health app. But for two nights consecutively the sleep details graph that shows amount of RAM ,Deep Sleep, Light Sleep etc is missing on the app. I can see these details on my watch under samsung health , so it seems it is recorded by the app, but when I open the app on my phone I can't see these details. I have tried rebooting the watch and again reinstalling the app but it didn't fix the issue."
very frustrating that after starting workout session on Galaxy 3 or Fit2 almost each time I check the watch the session has ended/existed or crashed - in one way or another stopped.. Also it would be great if it could via GPS know that I'm at the gym and start tracking automatically there.
"App would be perfect but i may have found an unfortunate glitch. Unsure if im using this incorrectly, but everytime i enter data for food ive noticed a few times that the data for activity automatically increases. I would be happy to send screenshots of this. Please can you send an email contact for me to send screenshots."
"Excellent health app, tracks steps can do multiple fitness modes. I mainly use for running which is great gives you updated every 1k (or half if ticked) tells you current time distance and estimated finish time. Could for bike rides as self stops if stopping for food etc. Can listen to music via it, track food, water intake."
"Pretty much only used this app to track my steps and liked the simple and clean look of the the step counter widget a lot. It stopped working and looks like they removed it and replaced with a larger, and just plain hideous looking one that takes up too much space."
"Good app, two issues, 1- recording the sleeping time is not correct because some times I'm laying down and playing games while the watch puts it as sleeping time and I'm not able to correct that or to change the time or override and record it manually. 2- the weekly summary is gone since 11/07/2020 it doesn't appear in my app."
"I hate the new update. I can no longer monitor my carb total throughout the day. Instead now I have to total each meal separately by myself. Also, I can no longer see my monthly weight stats; i.e., mini, max, and average. Quit giving us the phone number to call, and just make the old version available again. Change is evil! ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨"
"I used to love this app but the latest updates have rendered it almost useless. Lots of functions are missing. It's more of a downgrade than an upgrade! You used to be able to track SpO2 from your phone but now it's telling me I need to use ""my watch"". I don't own a watch. It's almost as though Samsung is trying to force us to purchase more products to continue using the app. Not cool. I want to be able to measure by blood oxygen using my phone like before. Please fix this."
"Competent enough, however it is unacceptable that the flagship fitness app from the maker of the expensive phone it is loaded on thinks it's a good idea to take up the entire top third of the screen on a massive banner add. It is bad UI and bad design and makes this app seem like it was developed by a small developer and not SAMSUNG, one of the largest and wealthiest corporations on the planet. Worth noting that the preview image does NOT show this horrendous tacky banner add..."
This app was one of the reasons I have been using Samsung phones for the last 5 years. This app is now absolute garbage since the update (5th August 2020) you have taken away the Weight loss tracking feature and the ability to easily see you exercise trends. It is almost like the developers deliberately made this app worse! When it comes to buying my next phone it probably won't be a samsung!
Keeps crashing. Phone suggested I put it in deep sleep. Started after recent update.
"I bought my Galaxy watch and while it did say it was compatible to Samsung health the Samsung Health program wont sync to anything else. Fitbits platform is far better at receiving and syncing with other programs. I wish now I would of just upgraded my Fitbit. I would love to see Samsung Health sync with Under armour record, or Map my walk."
"Not sure if it's app related or watch software related. But unlike on the Gear Fit (only flaw was the battery charging design). My Galaxy Gear Watch thinks I am sleeping if I am on my laptop or watching TV/movie. Left the movie theater and roughly 20-40 minutes later received sleep report. Now, the movie wasn't that bad... wish the phone showed similar graph and breakdown like the app (Gear Fit 2 used to show)."
"Absolutely pathetic. The Galaxy Watch Active 2 is unable to accurately measure heart, steps, distance and calories burned. Not to mention the results are wildly inconsistent. And I need 5 apps for one device where as my Fitbit only needed one. And it posted far more reliable results."
Like the challenges and the information provided in main screen. Love when use with the galaxy watch it starts the walking count exercise after 10 minutes and is automatic. Update 8/28/2020....the latest update remove weight management bad idea. Is a tool that I utilized and is gone. No idea who is your project management but they need to ask users ghs features we love from apps before making that kind of changes.
"I've used other free apps that came with phone, such as the ""my fitness pal"" which came on my iPhone. This app (Samsung health) is so basic it doesn't even compare to the ""my fitness pal"" App. All data entry is limited - food entries are limited, exercise entries are limited to the app's very limited data base...I really don't like it, feel it is worthless to me - it doesn't even allow you to make entries to personalize it to your needs"
"Absolutely love this app! I use it daily to track my calories and monitor my steps. Some of the excercise trackers seem to be a bit off, for example if I start a treadmill session the app says I've burned way more cals than the actually treadmill says I have. Also, just getting around to installing the latest update and I'm thrilled to see the mindfulness features! So awesome I can get rid of 2 other apps now lol"
"Recent updates are terrible. First they added a requirement to log in to a Samsung account to use the app. Then they took away the different views of being able to track weight over time (day, week, month). Now the app requires access to phone calls and 2FA, which it won't even let me complete (maybe because it requires contact access which I was not prompted for?) App has become useless, would give 0 stars if possible."
"My only problem is with recording ""sleep "". I do not sleep straight through because I am up several time at night with elderly family members that have health problems. I do get back to bed and sleep. I also take naps. However, I have not found a way to record this. The app seems to wants ""sleep"" to be continuous."
"Used to be really good and accurate. However, in the last couple of weeks, if I briefly stop activity, auto pause kicks in and won't restart. Cannot even get it to restart manually. Such a shame...... A UK number would be much more helpful, or even an online chat?"
"Honestly, they had one good feature, weight and calorie intake management, and now that's gone. You could have just made that thing optional. It was the reason I was using Samsung health. if I have to use two or three apps for my health tracking, it's not worth it. I'll probably end up using another app with weight management features as my main app. Sucks that my gear sport works only with this app otherwise I would uninstall it."
"The app or new update wants to much access to personal information. No excuse can explain or cover wanting access to my contacts or phone. Why give the option to decline, however to be punished or penalized for rejecting additional access and lose out on all achievements, stored information and workouts. So sad to see all that information and achievements to go to waste due to lack of respect for privacy. IT CAN'T BE PRIVACY IF EVERYONE WANTS TO ACCESS YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION."
"Locking basic sensors behind an account is appalling, especially during a pandemic where people may need to monitor their oxygen levels I don't want a online account to check my pulse and I don't need 2fa for that either. A simple app that lets me record my health to my phone, and lets me ise the sensors... will do. I will accept reduced app functionality rather than zero app functionality, so... bye"
"Having this app has made me try harder than I was before using it. I have lost over 30 kg, having the ability to challenge friends makes me go hard as I don't like losing. My only dislike is it allows people who in my opinion can't possibly walk, run over 2 million steps a month. I don't know if cycling could produce that amount of steps but I think Samsung should make these people prove that they are doing what the app says they are doing. I know my phone and watch track where I've been walking"
"I loved it until the updates..now it's just OK! A lot is missing from the prior version... the option to ""end your day"" is gone, and it no longer tells your weight tracking if you keep up your routine for that day (i.e., ""if everyday was like today you should weigh 146 pounds in 3 weeks"" etc); I also dont like that you cant see your prior days activities, nor can you go ahead (good options for meal planning and comparing); you can no longer scan food in; and the CAL calculation is confusing now."
"edit: I love the app, but unfortunately it is draining my watch battery like no tomorrow. I read online that this is due to an update and is a very common issue. Kindly fix this issue. Thank you! I love this app! It literally has everything in one: Track my runs or bike rides outside, count my calories, give me workout routines and walk me through them. So excited about this app I bought Samsung Active watch to go along with it. Can't wait to use both of them for a long long time!"
"Good for most things but the sleep tracking, the entire reason I bought this watch and app is horrible, it miscalculated my sleep by hours every day and the records of the sleep cannot be changed. I have mo ths of sleep records that are highly inaccurate. This.cpuld be so simple.to fix simply by allowing an edit of the sleep times, but for some reason this is not an option. I'll change my review if it ever fixed"
"The use of trends and ability to see my monthly/weekly weight averages is legitimately the only reason I used the app. It was basic and could of been improved on with more specific data entry or viewing; however, the removal of these minimal expectational features ruins my entire experience as a user."
"It's good. I like it better than Fitbit app because it tracks my GPS as it's running and shows a map overlay. Very useful for hiking trials. However even with health sync app, not worth using instead of Fitbit. Other than that real time GPS map overlay."
I find this app to be only okay and I feel like there is a lot of potential for improvement... But then again I could say that of most of Samsung's products and services (especially)... There a number of frustrating limitations... But that seems to be Samsung's forte - half baked products and services...
Used to enjoy using this app with my Samsung watch but not any more. Ever since the last update I can not even use the app. I have tried over and over to get past the two step verification and I can not. I have problems sleeping and used to be able to see the information my watch recorded on my phone. Now I get nothing from the app. Very disappointed.
"Like the app. Only thing that is bothering me a lot is in the monthly challenges where my icon or the ones of my friends are covering the star so I cannot see how long I still have to earn that star. Please fix where you tap on it that it will not only say that you need to get passed it before the timer runs out, but also give the time on that timer!"
"Have been using this app only for recording my walking exercises since buying this phone. Of late I feel some settings have changed and kilometers shown are much more, also timing in minutes per kilometer have reduced to 7~8 minutes from 11~12 which is my normal.Also my walks are shown in awkward zigzags passing through some people's backyard. Something is amiss. Have I inadvertently changed settings.Can someone guide please"
I've been using this app for years but the new update does not show me my macros in grams without going through additional steps making it harder to gage my intake. I also can no longer sort how I view the calendar under the weight tracker. I weigh myself once a month but when looking back I have to view every day which doesn't give me a clear view as most are blank.
"Really good with providing information, workouts, meditation, activity and health trackers and such. Really like all the information and how it works with other apps. Wish for a wider array of apps outside of the Samsung platform but the selection isn't that bad."
Good app. But it would be better if it could provide the total mileage/distance and steps for the trends/summaries and not just provide the average count. I find that information would be more beneficial than some of the other tracking options. Can that be updated?
"The food tracker stopped working... and deleted all my collected data. It shows only the total per day... if I click to check for details, it shows 0 data and freezes... in 5 to 6 secsonds it closes by itself w/o my interraction... I uninstalled it... installed it again... the issue stayed... however, mirracullously the day after, the app came to normal... It also will be quite usefull to may enter quantities in gramms instead of serving portions for ""my food""..."
"2nd time reviewing as the developer saw fit to remove my previous review. As all other reviews say - August update removed the Weight Management feature, changed the colour scheme to a hard to differentiate one and my step count tracking has been glitchy for ages. Samsung DON'T bother replying, just fix it otherwise this app is pointless."
"Love this app! However, I am frustrated with Cycling workout mode, seems like the calories calculation too far off the chart. For example, 40 minutes cycling of 13 km, with average heart rate of 125bpm, calories burned shown was 1300calories. Hope you fix this issue soon! Update: Looks like it has been fixed! Appreciate you prompt action!"
"The distance tracking is not accurate. The app overestimated my walking distance, eg. a 5 km walk was recorded as 6.5 km. The autodetect function cannot distinguish between brisk walk and jogging, even though on its activity graph the speed was shown to be doubling between the 2 activities."
"Does not work since the Galaxy Wearable update this morning. Will not sync with Wearable. Worked fine today before the Wearable update! Uninstalled and reinstalled - works now. 2-8-21 Same thing happened again today, wouldn't sync! Uninstalled and reinstalled and it now works again! I really like this app but it is annoying when it doesn't sync or just does not open"
Latest Update is absolute trash. Whoever is in charge of testing their app before releasing it should be fired and thrown out of a window. And thank you in advance for the canned response that means absolutely nothing and doesn't help fix anything. Roll back the update and fix it before you send out a piece of garbage like this again. Do better.
the distance calculator is terrible. My previous fitness watch allowed me to input my stride length and was accurate to within less than a tenth of a mile on a well defined five mile course. Samsung Health has no obvious method to input this information and it repeatedly understates actual distance walked by over a mile on the same 5 mile course. Sad! Fix it!
"COMPLETRLY USELESS TO DIABETICS OR ANYONE WHO CHOOSES NOT TO BUY A FITBIT TYPE WRIST DEVICE! This update (3) eliminates multi- meal entry, there are bar graphs instead of specific metrics on carbs, fats, and protein. (Do you think we're too stupid to care? A cutesy UI, if you're 16 years old, and even more ""vital"" stats no longer measurable! MASSIVE FAIL and obvious attempt to force the purchase of hardware."
"The app got broken on my A71 after the upgrade to one ui 4.1...step are not counted, cant see my previous data, together tab doesnt show anything, my dashboard tile just says updating but doesnt show anything since yeaterday.....need a fix ASAP. Well....things started working after I followed the given steps. Thanks for your prompt response."
"Great all-in-one health app in general. Some annoying parts, like the micronutrient stats for many foods being off (especially vitamin A). Overall solid and good integration with other apps. Good use of accelerometer for logging walks automatically."
I wanted to love this app but it stops counting my steps. I have reinstalled it 3 times and rebooted phone. Also tried the stop counting steps button and then reversing it but to no avail. The app works for a couple of days then suddenly stops counting steps again.
"For two days now, I can't record any workout activity with the app. It keeps shutting down by itself. I ran for 30 minutes on Friday but my activity wasn't recorded. The app set the calories burnt at 0. I have tried to delete and reinstall. Still same issue. Please fix this"
"After update, it's circular stuck on 2FA setup. Enter phone number, get verification code, and it sends me back to the start of 2FA setup. Doesn't continue to app. Edit/Response: I cleared SH cache and data, reverted to factory install (couldn't uninstall), restarted phone, reinstalled SH updates and have same issue. Note: I've used SH for several years and may not have had a ""Samsung account"". When I open the app, it does not prompt me for ID/password it just takes me to setup 2FA."
"The settings can be confusing and annoying just when i got used to the app and started to like and use it regularory i added a couple of features and suddenly a nightmare to operate but what really bugs me is the fact that its basically a display issue between my samsung galaxy tab A samsung galaxy s20 and tab 3 as to why this app doesn't appear and work or sync on all android devices i don't get it, fix that and stop changing the way it looks, and it would be essentially an awesome app"
"It's been mentioned a number of times, so I'll add mine too. The weight management feature is super effective to me personally. Disabling the feature really upset me, and had I known it was not there, I wouldn't have updated it. Please get it back."
"It is a very very good app to track your workout. Very much Thank you SAMSUNG for making such a helpful app. But now I am no more enjoying this app I facing a problem it is asking for my samsung account and I am not able to sign in it is just buffering and buffering, it was buffering for half an hour after which it is displaying network error even when the network connection is very good. I have also uninstalled the application twice but still I am not able to sign in.Now I want help frm SAMSUNG"
"I always enjoyed the app but since last week Friday it counted zero steps. I have done everything. I have cleared cache, cleared data, uninstalled, reinstalled and rebooted my phone... twice. Heaven only knows why but today it counted some steps again but again stopped working. Please fix these issues, no I'm not calling the states, I'm in South Africa. You're the only app with no stupid ads, please don't make me change"
"It's a nice app if you don't feel like looking at your watch. But to me that kind of defeats the purpose of having the watch lol. I can never seem to get the finger sensor on my phone to work to record any stats so for me that feature is pointless. But again, if you want to look at your stats on your phone rather than your watch this is a good way to do it."
"Pretty good app, especially the ability to customize what you track. I did wish that one of the things you could track is headaches to be able to better find the correlations of things that may be causing headaches and migranes (triggers of food)."
No longer works properly. I have to keep clearing the cache for it to count steps properly. Now the audio guide no longer works. I have tried going through all the settings. Not sure what happened but Samsung Health is pretty useless now.
"First time using it. A bit disappointed considering all the updates. I don't own the Samsung smart watch. I use Polar. I wish the app had the ability to pull data from other devices it apps other than just Samsung stuff, especially not everyone has everything Samsung. Just saying. Also it'll be nice to be and to personalize the notifications or alerts."
"Since August 2020 the newer updates are making the app worse. 1. Removed the weight management dashboard which was easy to track intake calories vs weight loss. Next the step counter seems to drop steps on the go. In a 1 hour run, it counts 2000 steps less than other pedometer app on the same device and checked against another phone in the other pocket. Now the food tracking merged 2 in between snacks to one, out makes it harder to count calories not easier. Samsung please fix these issues."
Pity the app does not tell you how long it will take your body to recover after exercise.Most other health app's has this feature
"Terrible app. The previous version was great, the latest version is terrible. Avoid to use it as it will only irritate the user. I see from Samsung update that they have made improvements on layout. This is surely ment to be ironic but I do not know or understand why Samsung has spproved to make changes to the app that makes the app so user-unfriendly, when they had a great app. My suggestion to Samsung fire the people that has approved the latest version of the app."
"Great app. However I have a feedback that can help improve the overall app. Please can we get the Totals of the steps taken calorie burnt etc for the week as summary? currently I only get Averages for the week but not the total for the week. it will be great if we can add this feature as all data is already there , it's just adding another math formula. will give it 5 stars once this feature is added."
"This app is CONSTANTLY updating which interferes with my other apps. It causes them to freeze and crash. I tried enabling the app from automatically updating but it still does updates. I don't want to uninstall this app, but I'm getting frustrated with the problems it's causing."
Since the new version SyncMyTracks doesn't work. I have been using my Samsung Active2 watch while running and then sharing my data from Samsung Health with Nike Running Club. This is simply not possible anymore. Is there a way to install the previous version or that you allow access to the syncing app or that you allow syncing with NRC through Samsung Health?
"I'm devestated! I used weight management constantly to check how I was doing throughout the day. It was the best feature on this app and I feel like my whole health check system has been ripped away from me. I can't imagine why these features would be taken away, the app is useless now and I feel completely lost!"
The app itself is great but it's utterly ridiculous you can't change food database language. I'm an English speaker living in Italy and I can't use any food related function because it search against the English database with products that don't even exist here. I don't understand why we aren't given a simple 'app language' or app location to solve this without having to switch the entire phone language. Because of this I have to use an entire different app only for food tracking.
"2/15/21 when you log your food for calories daily, should have have options for food you make yourself, not always eating out. 1/21/21 Cycling keeps pausing when riding speed bike. I have lost data because of update. I prefer the old version. 1/19/21 Same thing is happening again with app. I do not feel like calling to fix this. App was working fine till update. I have Uninstaller and reinstalled and does not fix."
"No longer works unless you allow access to phone calls. What? You don't need access to my calls to measure any of the metrics on the app. Pure privacy info grab. Edit to respond to Samsung: if that is true, it shouldn't disable the app when I disable that access. Your response does not make sense from a technical standpoint. Your response that the access isn't used means it shouldn't be required."
As with others I really loved the app prior to the latest update. Really disappointed with losing the Weight Management feature. It was great and really helped me manage my calorie intake versus exercise. PLEASE BRING IT BACK!
"This app worked great with my Galaxy S6, just recently bought a Galaxy S9 and the app is horrible. I walk for 20 minutes without stopping and it doesn't record my healthy step. I tried this 3 times and the same results. Will be checking other apps to monitor my walking, this one isn't working properly. Never had this issue with my S6."
So far I've been enjoying it. My only complaints have been related more to my phones sensor being unable to register pulse or stress without having to hold everything the right way. I also wish I could get a better read of how I slept instead of needing a peripheral to record that.
DELETED THE APP. Absolutely horrible 2021 updates for samsung health app. You make permission changes mandatory to use the app. Without any explanation you want to have make phone contact permission. What feature would seriously need that? The generic answer u provide to everyone that you wont share it to third party does not reassure us as that decision can easily be changed once you have our data. This does not make sense nor should it be mandatory. As long as this app require contacts i m out
Strava integration was terrific till samsung updated 2 versions ago. Till samsung fixes the integration issue I'll continue to use to old app version. Workouts from strava do not pass through so the exercise shows up. Confirmed with strava the data continues to flow however samsung will not fix on their end. I call technical help at samsung and they confirmed however no date or time to fix has yet to be communicated. To Samsung: I've called and your tech support says there is nothing to fix....
Very disappointed with the removal of integration with other fitness apps. My watch came with a free year subscription for all of the map my fitness/ under armour apps. Now I'm no longer able to share information with those programs. who asked for this.
You can stop the app having Telephone permissions in the App Permissions page in Andoid Settings. Why 1 Star? Adverts. I can't remember seeing any adverts on the Home page of the old ver. of this app. Now there is a huge ad that takes up 1/4 of my S9 screen. Not what I expect to see from a Samsung App on a Samsung device and you dont even offer an Ad-free option! Remind me... How much are you phones? And you still expect people to be totally find having ads in your apps?
"Good but getting more unstable with each update. Recently cycling the cycling tracker will freeze while in use, losing my ride data. Now today if I try to initiate a cycling workout it will just freeze up and force close. Used to be rock solid but it's becoming unreliable. I might export all my riding data off and use another app instead."
"Great app! Love it! Tracks everything and does it all. Calorie section can be linked to MyFitnessPal so it uses the bigger database. This app is seriously awesome. ***I have one suggestion: maybe under the Sleep section we can have the option to add notes(maybe 200 characters). That way we can track dreams, nightmares, events before sleeping, and sleep paralysis****"
"Pretty good app for tracking calorie intake, sleep schedule, exercise, water and caffeine intake. The food tracker keeps you mindful and can help you plan better options while still being human (beer for evening snack...ok....then no ice cream ü§£). Would be cool if there was an exercise option for house cleaning (mopping, sweeping, scrubbing...) or yard work (mowing, raking leaves, manual edging, hedge cutting...) I know I feel it the day after a good house cleaning üòÖ"
"I like the overall app, and I believe it really depends on the individual person's preferences if someone will like the new update or not. I use it to track my sleep, steps, heart rate, exercise. I am just hoping the ECG & Blood pressure feature is available soon in Ireland!"
"This app is good but I have 2 problems: Number 1 is that it says ""You can save your heart rate and stress level data, but the blood oxygen is not complete"". And it doesn't record steps when you are away from the phone. Please fix this!"
Where did the heart rate and stress level monitor go? I have a S10 and the sensor on my phone is now useless. I updated the phone software and discovered it wasn't working with the Samsung health app so I Uninstalled my app and reinstalled it to discover it's now completely missing. Other issues with my phone updates are my SD card will a lot of pictures and video won't even open in my phone anymore. I am not sure how to open it with formatting. Samsung updates are eliminating the functions
Helped me track and log period and ovulation cycle accurately.
"Great stats for running when paired with the Galaxy Watch. The app worked flawlessly on my old Samsung phone. Since I switched to the Pixel Pro 6, the app conveniently has trouble pairing with my watch after runs. The only fix is to force stop the app repeatedly until the watch will finally sync."
"Same functionality as watching a YouTube exercise routine; not what I am looking for in a fitness app. Good for casual fitness or getting started but not great for tailoring to an intermidiate or advanced fitness level or recording details about workout. Doesn't import/sync with other health apps. Update: additional frustration, not getting full duration of workout when tracking a fitness program on my Samsung watch. 50 min weight lifting recorded as 4 mins."
"Used to work brilliantly not won't even log in, the app was just closing instantly soon as I opened it. Uninstalled and downloaded again from play store now it won't log in. Soon as I pass the verification via text I get a blank white screen with a spinning graphic then it won't go any further. I used to love this app as it worked so well via my Samsung galaxy watch. Very disappointed. Tried to gain access and reinstall about 4 times with no luck"
"Nice app, I like that I have my training (walking, running) and my food diet easy trackable. I found everything and I have managed to lose almost 7 kg in 10 days. It helps me to focus with a small goals. Very nice feature is auto stop and start when training and works just perfect. I'm very happy and I wish a day to have the possibility to add a Samsung smart watch. Thank you Samsung."
Have used app for several months and really enjoy it but all of a sudden it kept stopping. I could click on the steps taken and it would open that page but nothing else. Had to uninstall and reinstall so now all my data is lost and I have to start over.
Not a fan of the update. I can't keep track of the amount of food I'm eating per day anymore because the numerical values are gone. They've been replaced with these little bar things. I can't even see what my carb intake is now. Really disappointed with the new interface.
"Update: developer response says there are no ads.... There are a lot of ads. When every page includes offers about ""premium trials"" for other apps, and the home page has a big banner across the top telling me about sales for other Samsung products... Well call me crazy but I consider those ads. Why would you remove features? Why am I bombarded with advertisements on a device I've already bought from you? Previous updates were usually helpful and appreciated, this most recent one is terrible."
I would have rated this 5 star but the recent update has changed that. This used to be my favorite fitness app. I've lost about 15lb in two months using their weight management tool and was on a hard track to losing more and making better choices. With the removal of the weight management widget it's now just a step counter/sub-par food logger and I will probably be moving to another app.
"I am also very disappointed with this new update! It's like someone who knows nothing about fitness and nutrition decided to update the app. They took out your total macros for the day so I can't see how much total protein I've had for the day, aswell as took out how to see my weekly average for my weight, aswell as other features! This app was perfect before, all my friends were jealous of it, and now I'm going to have to switch if these features remain gone."
"The latest update is useless. I was in the green on the scale and now I'm on the red. I've gone from being healthy to obese!!! Oh, and apparently I'm only allowed 900 calories a day!! Thanks for destroying my self confidence. I've lost 21lbs in 7 weeks and I felt really good until this happened :'( And stop telling people to phone an overseas number and actually read the reviews and make an effort to fix the many glitches. Uninstalling this now useless app"
Used to love this app as the weight management tool was brilliant for encouraging extra exercise when in the red or not having the extra snack to stay in green. Now it has been removed I'm looking for another suitable app. The exercise and foid tracking is good but now they are not combined seems a bit pointless
"I love it! The monthly step challenges have been fun! I achieved the 200,000 step challenge in June, and my goal has been to do 300, 000 in July! I've got 3 days and 30,000 steps to go! (Easy peasyüòÅ) This app (utilized with my Samsung S3 smartwatch) has definitely helped keep me on track with my overall weight loss journey and my activity levels! I highly recommend it!"
"I agree with Joe. I used this app to be a step counter for another app that I have to use for work. I don't see the point of it *requiring* that I have a two factor authorization and access to my phone. I should be able to turn the access to these off and still use the program to count my steps. Since the program won't let me, I'm unloading the program and finding something else. To reply to Samsung's reply: You don't get it. Your app is on my phone and only on my phone. Using my phone to provide security to an app on my phone is pointless. That's like locking my bedroom door with the same key I lock my front door."
"Love it, and use it daily. Its been years and our love, me and the app goes strong. So far the best app for my needs. And is compatible with my active watch. The charts are easily understandable, data is trackable. Gps tracking is perfect. And most importantly, this app motivates me! Thank you!:)"
"I have an Active 2 watch and it I am forced to use this app to see activities recorded with the watch. The app is actually great really hitting the balance between features and simplicity. The problem is just that it SUCKS at exporting data to other services like Strava. The TCX files it uploads to Strava are incorrectly formatted resulting in Strava reporting wildly incorrect information. This one tiny issue, that seems to get no attention from Samsung, absolutely ruins the experience of this app as well as the premium smart watch. Huge numbers of other people have the same complaint as is evident by complaints on Samsung's wearables forum. Please could the developers fix the TCX file format? If this one issue is fixed, my review would be 5 stars."
"The last update wants phone permission and I am not willing to give up more of my personal privacy to a tech culpable. I've been using this app for years and until I don't have to give this permission, I will be done with this app. It was a good app that was very useful for me. Edit after Samsung response: My customer experience was very good before the update, your change is poor customer service and I have deleted the app."
Was working fine until last week. Contacted app support and went through the steps. Worked again for a day and now just stops. I hope samsung app support can fix this issue. Seems to have started after last Android update. Please fix because I love this app. I followed another suggestion in the reviews. If you don't auto sync your data from your samsung account then can use the app to track steps and exercise. There is disconnect with the data permission between app and samsung account.
Since the last update it no longer automatically detects workouts. So as far as bug fixes.. Fake news! It created glitches. Before the update I would have given it 5 stars. I have to manually turn on record workout. First world problems.
"Very good appearance, but terribly wrong distance measurement. Which is what the app is for. Shame Installed Strava and MiFit to compare, after it became apparent that it isn't correct. The other two apps were almost identical with the measurements. This was 1km wrong over 5km test."
"After latest update Jan. 2021 I can no longer use the app, guess I'm uninstalling after using for 5 years now. Prompts me to sign in, never had to before, I click sign in, get a pop up ""Samsung acct already exists in acct manager"" doesn't let me do anything just repeats the pop up over & over. I have to follow a strict diet/schedule all my meals were ready to quickly select in the app & now I can't even access them to copy & transfer to another app. Same with workout schedule."
"It's a nice motivating app, however i wish it would have more flexibility in accepting other devices and more importantly ,other phone brands (Huawei, iPhone,etc). Not everyone has Samsung devices and from this point of view ,i cannot compete or have fun with my friends, which is the main objective and motto of this app. So this is why i rated 3 stars. Other than this, the app is easy to use, stable, user friendly."
"After 2 years of using the application, they changed the privacy agreement and asked me to agree to access my personal photos, contacts, and calls. When I refused, they took away my access to my personal health info. Very disappointing üòû. No issues, I will search for and start using another health app."
"They should update ""step graph"" it's nice to see steps walked per day/week/month and avarage also. But it would be more nicer if they could add also that we see how much km or miles we walk per day/week/month and avarage. And also an option to see when was the most steps-distance walked in all time like a ""personal records"" or something like that"
"I can see no reason at all this needs permission to access my phone calls and all none of the replies give any kind of explanation so it's been uninstalled. I'm thinking of getting a new smartwatch and it won't be a Samsung if this is how cavalier their attitude is to reasonable questions about privacy and access. Edited after response: I don't know what the ""together feature"" is and ""a better overall service experience"" is not an explanation, no matter how many times you repeat it."
This app used to feature an blood oxygen Monitor that worked with the sensor on your phone. I compared it to other expensive professional ones and it was spot on every time. In a recent update they removed it which is very unfortunate. It would have been amazing for Covid 19 early detection.
"It's pathetic while using a vehicle, step counter counts automatically as steps, I can't stop or change it. There is not user friendly Indian food items like ladyfinger or other green vegetables, a long list with typical names appears which is very confusing to choose and add in food. Step counter also shows wrong distance in kilometres. If we pause, pedometer counted steps can't be changed or clear."
"Update: Samsung is making the decision to remove select tracking options on the next update. They gave a generic response telling me to contact support instead of evaluating their development and management decisions. No support needed. Do NOT buy a Galaxy Watch! //They're removing weight and calorie tracking along with quite a few other features. Not only does this app contains ads, which in unacceptable for the hundreds you spend on accessories, they're removing features. Shame on Samsung."
Great app. Food tracker is fantastic.
Overall a good app. One thing that I could never understand and it is quite frustrating is why I can export a gpx file only for some activities. I get a gpx file for walking for example but not for skiing. Very frustrating! Otherwise its a good app for activities tracking and more!
It started off great on my Sony. But since using Hauwei it's bad. I need to keep reopening the app constantly for it to work and start counting. I set it to stay on my notifications board but keeps closing itself. I'm losing out on a lot of steps and fitness records
"Since the last update, all my food counts are at zero. I do like the app overall but this was helping me keep on track. Also, I am getting different totals for what activity I need to complete for the day on different pages of the app. It has been inconsistent for a few days."
"If you want to track your mileage, go elsewhere. This app ALWAYS miss counts my miles. And by alot. I ran ten miles multiple times and the app doesn't detect laps. It just doesn't count them. So instead of ten, you will only get like one mile actually tracked. I wish I could give them zero stars. Thats how much they deserve."
"Pretty good, always room for improvement. Would like to be able to trim workout times, as sometimes I will fail to stop it right away. Would like to be able to sync food tracking with CarbManager/MyFitnessPal/Chronometer as I have no plans on tracking in two apps."
A downgrade on a health app during the pandemic!!! I though that Samsung would care more about their users and their health in such times! I used this app for a few years and loved it. I recommended it to many people and recently convinced my wife to buy a Galaxy Watch inorder to track her calories more closely. We are both so disappointed to see that the new version got rid of the Weight Mesurement. This litterally makes this app and some how our watches useless for us.
"It was great apps before. But for the past week, after apdated, the sleep app become error. No data of sleep chart were recorded. Only the total time. Prefer the dark display then bright one now. Thank u, today there is update for this apps. And the sleep chart was back again... Thank u üëçüëçüëç"
Use to be a great app. Now due to update they have decided to get rid of weight management features. I would rather see my weight management back. Only got the fit e band to go with my Samsung phone looks like I shouldn't have changed from my fitbit as you get everything you need on the fitbit app :(
"I have never had any app or diet that helped me lose weight and have a healthy life style more than this app! I am very disappointed you removed the weight management portion on the latest update. Knowing how many more minutes of exercise I needed in order to reach my goals was the most important part of the app! Please, please, please put it back! The app was a complete 5 star plus until then."
"The app is great, love all the exercise, and other tracking to help me monitor and improve my health. My only annoyance is the global step challenges is broken. I highly doubt that several users are doing over a million steps that preposterous in 15 days. Underestimating average human stride to 2ft thats 2 million ft distance that's approximately 400 miles in 15 days and it usually happens faster. So I wish they would fix this as it distorts the model of how I or anyone else does in comparison."
Tried adding 2 friends via text so many times it didn't work. Wrote a review and they deleted it. Finally was able to add a friend and I can barely see anything. My friends and I want to be able to keep track of our progress and this is all about who won a competition.
Useful app and nice if your using Samsung products across the board. Must say I'm deeply disappointed there's no web interface for this to review stats etc on a computer. Compatibility with non Samsung devices seems sparse but guess I shouldn't be surprised by that one.
"I was using the app daily for the past 4yrs & it worked great. Now with the new update I cant always get the app to open. When I do get the app open I tried to log my weight, pulse, & diet. It appeared to have logged it but then wont show me what I just entered or any previous entries. It hasn't logged my step count in days and has put me behind on monthly goals & behind everyone I was competing/walking with. Completely unusable."
"NO DAILY Macros in grams?!? Why? It used to count the %plus the amount in gr. This new update doesn't. How usesless!?! It shows fiber but nott total carb for example. I can calculate it but isn't this what the app if for. I have to input all my food as 1 meal to be able to see it. S Health is probably the worst with the odd workout presets -deadlifts for example. Who deadlifts continuously? I only used it due to the macro count and step count but now that this is ruined, the app is obsolete."
Auto daily calories. Where'd it go? App used to automatically enter my target daily calories each day (as what I had eaten). My workouts subtracted from this so I would know how many I was over or under. now it just says I've eaten zero calories every day. I don't want to enter every food I eat. don't have the time. Am I missing some setup option? thanks. I like the app.
I miss when it tracked your heart rate and other health info. It was helpful. Now not so much. Samsung Health no longer takes these measurements through your finger tip. You have to add them manually which can be bothersome and isn't possible if you don't have an alternate way to measure them and if you have an alternate way to measure your vitals you probably also have an alternate way to track them so why use this app?
"I'm having a major problem of my gear S2 and my galaxy S8 plus not syncing activity time and steps. they are connected via bluetooth, but do not show the same step data. the app can show me if I choose the device individually, but cant show the correct amount of total steps."
"I have uninstalled and reinstalled this app 3 times... I have recently purchased a Samsung Galaxy Watch Active 2 and although I can view my Samsung Health app through my watch, it will not load it on my phone at all!! Just a constant loading screen! I left it unattended with the screen timeout turned off last night and it was still loading when I woke up... Uninstalling and reinstalling have not helped so this app is basically useless on an Android smartphone. I have a Moto G7 Optimo Maxx"
Since I purchased a Active 2 watch I love this app. Prior to that it wasn't too helpful as a stand alone app. My one request is to be able to manually adjust the ounces for water/coffee like you can in the Fitbit app. I don't necessarily drink my fluids in 8 ounce increments. 7/20 Update - Still 5 stars. I'd like to suggest adding the ability to take notes in the sleep section like we can in exercise. My deep sleep score is really poor so I would like to add notes on what is and isn't working.
I like the updates. I connect it to my fitness pal. MFP now requires you pay for to track calories burned through excercises tracked. Samsung has updated and does it free. I like the monthly challenges and sleep tracker as well. It'd be cool if samsung health had a barcode scanner to scan in food which is one of the only reasons I still have MFP
"Can't log in! I am unable to track activities from the watch. Samsung help was not helpful at all, I received automated message first aksing if my chrome is updated (it is), and later saying they will ""look into the matter"". I'm very disappointed. Before contacting help, i followed steps with clearing cache and reinstalling the app."
"Was working ok until it stopped tracking my fitness routine classes. I was using the running exercises, started confusing me that I didn't complete some days, which I obviously did. Whatever the latest update, some coding are missing. Fix it please. Annoying when completed the run and being exhausted, for only the app to tell you didn't finish it."
"Overall this is a great app however it is beyond frustrating that when tracking water intake the only option for glass/bottle size is 8.4 oz, I use a 28oz water bottle. In other water tracking apps you can customize your glass/bottle size which makes complete sense.. figure it out Samsung!"
"Love the app generally but this week it intermittently will not pick up steps from my Samsung efit just keeps repeating ""syncing this may take some time"" but doesn't sync. Getting more than a little frustrated with it. Tried uninstalling, reinstalling, disconnecting watch, resetting it and tonight I'm back to square one where watch steps dont match on Samsung health. Cache cleared on Samsung wearable and Samsung health doesn't work either"
"It a good app. However I believe that the recommended calorie intake number is completely off. Other caloric intake calculators I've used are consistent in suggestion that I need near 2000 calories a day while this suggests that I need just 1568 calories for caloric maintenance. Even though you are allowed to adjust your calorie intake to your liking, it just seems very unprofessional in this app to have such an error in number. Please correct this very simple fix. Thanks."
Amazing when it actually works. Everytime I go to open the app it's instantly shut down and just will not open! Every so often it will finally work. Sometimes have to uninstall and reinstall or constantly force stopping the app! Because of this it's not counting my apps on any challenges
"great after the latest update, but still some bugs with alarm and countdown. the ""x"" button and the snooze button do not work when the alarm rings; same for countdown, the ""x"" button does not work when time's up. Thanks."
"Me- ""its dumb that I cant count steps exclusively on my samsung smartwatch and not also my phone. It doubles the count if I have both."" Developer- ""you can go through these steps to make your steps work again"" Me- ""..."" Also i was told to ""go to pedometer"", but i can find nothing like that on my phone in either the Samsung health app or when searching within the phones settings."
"I really love this app. It's full of positive messages when you meet your goals, and offers encouragement when you don't. One thing I would love to see is a more customizable sleep record. I wake up often in the night for an hour or two, but the app records it as a continuous number of hours slept."
"This app is amazing! I love how much detail it shows with everything in the world of health. Specific nutrient scores for food tracking, great visuals and graphics for steps and calories, and so many more cool features. By far the best health/fitness app I've ever used."
App no longer syncs with Samsung watch. Nice work software engineers. Update: I dug into the setup and remembered that last week the watch software updated and it seemed to have turned off the Bluetooth connection. It now syncs now. 4 stars.
"Good app. using my Galaxy Watch, I track every detail possible. Recently,a very basic women's health which tracks cycles and moods is added: Not bad, but I think it REALLLYY needs to be worked on. also I hope there will be a pregnancy mode available soon. Coz no matter how much u workout,u still gain weight; also the detectet heartrate of 130bpm,which is somehow equal to 170bpm in a not pregnant woman and is the maximum allowed heart rate during pregnanc,is labeled under ""moderate activity"" :|"
"App is completely broken. Cannot skip 2FA step, and cannot actually complete the step, so cannot use the app at all. Uninstalled and reinstalled, issue was not resolved. Horrible user experience. One hair away from completely switching off of Android all together so I can use an Apple Watch."
"I got the app for my watch and 80% of the time works fine. But sometimes even if I'm not wearing my watch and haven't used the app in weeks, my phone will suddenly die or be really drained In battery. Like sometimes the %drops in front of me over the course of about two minutes and when I go into battery settings samsung health is the culprit. I then have to stop the app but its very inconvenient when I think after sitting for an hour I still have 50% battery only to find I have 16%"
"I've used a few different fitness apps (fitbit, misfit, my fitness pal) and this is by far the best. Everything, food tracking, weight management, water intake, steps, exercise, etc, it's all here in this one app. The monthly community challenges and individual vs matches make fitness feel like a video game, and the community is incredibly supportive. I get excited to explore new areas to post photos of! My apple friends got so jealous when I showed them what this app has!! üíñ"
This new update has fewer features. For example the weight is not shown for week and month. Food section has only one snack section that is not useful. The previous version was much better. I hope that the developers consider adding old features to the new update.
"I love this app., but I can't give it five stars. The reason? I love the walking challenges, but there are too many individuals who are fixing their steps and are somehow going 200,000 plus steps in a day although their daily step count says zero. I join the challenges for a true challenge. I dont care if I'm the first one done, but people should not be cheating just for their own pleasure. it's frustrating for those of us who are taking it seriously."
"Overall, I like it but why does my husband have the option to measure oxygen levels on his Galaxy Watch 3 but I don't? Both of us are registered in Germany and both devices were bought and set up on the same day.. Also the look isn't quite the same. But yes we both have the latest update. Seems arbitrary..."
Ever since the last update I've had an issue where Myfitnesspal keeps disconnecting on its own as soon as I connect it. Never had any issues before now. I always track my food and exercises to myfitness pal and have it carry over to my Samsung health to see where I'm at for the day calorie intake/expenditure wise and nutrients wise. I'd really really hate to have to delete the app now as I've grown accustomed to using both every day for the past year or so and love equally. Please fix!!!
"I have mixed feelings about this app. On one hand, it's handy. I have been logging my diet, measuring my water intake and exercise. On the other hand, it's not intuitive. It took me a while to figure out where my target info was. It's also hard to add workouts and food from past days. I also mimick what others said about not being customizable for a person's diet. I love the hiking counter, the features are rad, I hate that she talks to me for my entire hike. I wish I could turn voice off."
"Wanted to use this app to track my steos, excercises, water intake and do the solo challenges. Now it requires phone permissions for authentication and contacts for challenges. I hate this. This could be done so those things are optional. In short, very very bad app."
"Have literally used and loved this app for years and found no issues with it. However, its been completely ruined with the recent updates! You took away all the features I used to love, specifically the trends! I'm so unhappy with it, have started looking for alternative apps now."
I love this app and use it regularly for my water intake and weight measures. However in the water intake meter I'd like it better if it had a personalized measurement ( for example: My water bottle takes 2 cups and a half) and on that app it says either 2 cups or 3 cups. So I'd like it to be personalized that way to insert the exact in between measurements!
Seriously disappointed. I got this app with my smartwatch and originally and it had weight management which tracked your activity versus your calorie intake. They've removed this feature and it seriously takes away from the function that was the primary reason I purchased the watch. Removing this health and weight inclusive feature was a very poor decision on Samsung's part. The app is basically useless at this point. I could have bought a cheap pedometer. Put it back.
"I loved this app. However in 2019 it started to not run properly with my food library now taking about 3 minutes to upload, new food items I load takes about 3 minutes to add into list and now any meal I eat used to show for a week at bottom of library and it won't. Troubleshooting steps from Samsung health used to work however since Christmas Eve all troubleshooting has failed and I keep getting told ""it's getting worked on check for updates"". I used this app daily and it's very important to me"
"You cannot look at past heart rate measurements anymore - only hourly averages. This has been changed a few updates ago. Before it, you could switch between exact measurements and averages. Now if you do sport after getting up you get only a min-max entry record of a heartrate in the range of 45-160 - which is impressingly useless. This is really not what I expect from a fitness focused app."
"The weight management function was removed, thus making this app much less useful as it doesn't have a large glossary of foods and the primary function I used was the weight management and the friends with walking. Still fine for heartrate and connecting my gear to myfitnesspal, but annoying that I can't see what I've ""worked off"" so to speak."
"After a update the heart rate, stress, and oxygen features are not working. This app is useless without these features. Please fix this!!! It's the best feature on the phone! It took me 5 transfers to get someone to tell me that you are 'working on the update to fix the problem'. Thank you Joel. Why can't you just automatically fix it??? Why do I have to keep checking back in the playstore??? Again, Please Fix This!!!"
"Good app for tracking fitness and weoght, but its shown that you can not rely on it for tracking some things. It until very recently had pulse oxygen tracking, this was the main reason i tried it and that has now been removed. So, good app, just dont expect that the measurements you've been relying on will always be there. *edit in responce to Samsung* giving users something useful, then hobbling it is not a good look here Samsung. if this was even a human responding."
"Used this fine up until the last update. Now it needs permission to make and manage phone calls to even be usable. Absolutely disgusting move by Samsung. Doesn't say what it's for either, and every reply they make to a review about this just says it's for an ""optimal user experience"", very hard to believe when it literally makes the app unusable if you deny the permission. Literally a copy paste reply on 90% of reviews. Next phone won't be a Samsung that's for sure."
"I gave this a 4 star because the app works great tracks steps,sleep,stress etc... but the down fall is I like to enter my food and the fact that this does not have a scanner like say my fitness pal it makes it a little hard to enter food and can take some time when your on the go which I am if the app were to have that I would not have any complaints..maybe for future updates add a scanner to make entering food simpler for us that are on the go..."
"The updates have got rid of ""trends"" for each workout. I was easily able to look at the amount of ""sessions"" per workout per day. Not for real athletes. Real athletes would like more than 3 exercise shortcuts. How about five or how about u let the user decide how many exercise shortcuts they want on their home screen of the app. And real athletes would rather track ""High Knees"" but instead u have ""yachting"". I cant think of a gym trainer that would recommend ""golf"" as a warm up."
"I used to love this app and recommend it to other Samsung users BUT they got rid of a lot of the features in the latest update and now I just don't feel satisfied using it anymore. Like, I loved the ""healthy step"" count and the weight/calorie management feature to see what my net calories were for the day but all of that is gone now...hoping it comes back in the next upgrade so I can change my rating again."
"Great app. Convenient, clear design. BUT I started using another application, because there is a barcode scanner that helps you find the desired product faster. I miss Samsung Health, but it's faster. Hope to be back in the future."
"I wrote an email to the email that was listed in the play store, unfortunately I got a half English half Korean reply. Basically stating that I couldn't send emails to that email address. So I now have two questions. Could you please change your contact details and supply users with the correct email address? And could you add an period tracking feature to the Samsung health app? Since I can't seem to find this feature even though it is an important aspect of women's health."
"It's ok. It has some cool features, like measuring stress, although I have my doubts about accuracy. It's a little intense though, like the alerts I get at 2am lamenting my low step count and asking me why don't take a walk? Dude, the day is 2 hours old, so chill. I'll have more than zero steps befofe the day is over."
I swim for an hour twice a day. I love the tracking until any form of alert or notification comes through. Because I am swimming it has a locked screen. The alert stops the tracking. I have to stop swimming. Turn my screen lock off which finishes my workout to turn off the alert. Now everything is not working and I have to start the workout all over. I am lucky if half of my workouts don't get stopped
"This app is awesome when I'm riding my bike...but super annoying when it won't stop telling me my that my workout is ""paused"" or ""workout resumed"" even when I'm not using the app at all...and simply sitting. Yes, the app is turned off completely (not even running in background). Freak!!"
After another update it is worst. All the features I actually used have been taken away. Searching for a new app to transfer all my data. I'm updating my review to 1 star. Please give an option to remove the BMI. 1. It's not even accurate. 2. There are many different reasons people track their weight and weight lose isn't always one of them. I don't need my phone telling me I'm obese when I'm lifting heavy weights than most other women around me.
"Over the this app has gotten worse over te... They have started removing features and the weight management feature and now. I can't even search for food items that i could search for before. Lucky I can search for those foods in the iOS version of the app and add it there. Edit. Even the response you get from is ridiculous, generic development rubbish."
"I, along with others, am surprised and disappointed that Samsung has removed the most useful part of Samsung Health. As a temporary option I purchased a Garmin while I saved up for the Galaxy Watch. It was only a week or so, but when I came back to Samsung was shocked to see the weight management feature missing? Please put it back."
"Access to manage my phone calls, completely unnecessary. After using for years I'm done! I don't care about your 'optimal experience' if you don't care about my privacy! Hacking is a huge issue, it doesn't matter that you don't intend to use the data, it matters that you're bothering to collect it with no option for me to deny that permission other than deleting the app."
"As my S10 has heartbeats/spo2 sensor I dowloaded this app to get access of this feature in this bad time of Covid19. I discovered the sensor is unreliable always showing value 4-5% lower than the real level of spo2 making the sensor useless as the range of use is 100-95 ok, 95-90 attention, below90 red alarm. It would be for Samsung a great chance to make the difference supporting people in a time of real disaster worldwide. I paid lot of money just for a useless toy. That's a shame."
"Samsung have not added a working stress feature or the original SpO2 measurement back in CANADA! June 2019 was the last time when I was able to use the SpO2 feature. Stress and SpO2 categories are present in latest app version. However there is no measurement button to take new readings. I feel that I have been robbed by Samsung. They sold me a phone with an advertised SpO2 feature, then they removed the feature without my consent. Why was it removed, and not restored in Canada?"
"It worked pretty good at the beginning, now with my galaxy watch S3 y and my Galaxy S9, I can't get to open de app and record my weight, it syncs with my watch but it pops up an error that for security reasons this app doesn't work on a rooted phone, and I have never rooted my phone. I've tried to force stop the app, clean its cache and nothing!"
I've been using samsung watch 3 for over a month now(previously used fitbit for over 3 years) and I'm extremely disappointed with the watch/app. It occasionally recognizes activities and even the step tracker is buggy. Samsung health app is so dull and samsung needs to improve the app in order to make it more interesting and interactive.
"Like the app - the challenges are fun - kinda stupid that my smartphone and smartwatch aren't ""smart enough"" to track my steps from the previous days/weeks - unless you join the challenge before it starts, none of your previous data will be counted, so let's say you join the monthly challenge on the 3rd day of the month instead of the last day of the previous month, none of your steps for the past 3 days will count and you'll start at 0 for the challenge, even though your phone and watch have the data for those days..."
Getting customer service attention. I am now getting an error code with the newest update. 0x2C#0#null
"This used to be one of my favorites, but now it won't let me log in, asks for permissions I don't want it having, and they don't let you actually use the app unless you agree to everything! All of a sudden they hold you hostage... I'll be finding a different app to track my steps, miles, water intake, etc. since it won't let me do that on here anymore..."
"Many important feature missing here are 1. I want to check the SpO2 (oxygen saturation levels in blood), it was there in my old app but new app does not have it 2. measuring Heart rate using phone is missing, i have to use only my watch all the time 3. I want to check the OVERALL STEP COUNT for a week or a month but my health app is showing AVERAGE per week/month but not sum of steps, which does not make any sense...."
A tad annoying. Not set for UK and can't see options so you get a notification in the early hours telling you you need to be more active! I turned off notifications but still get them. Have ended up uninstalling this to get peace! Other than that it's quite good to know how many steps rtf you've done.
"As others have said, you don't need access to make and receive phone calls or access to my contacts. It's an invasion of my privacy. Denied! Same for all the other apps you keep adding to my device. Stop or I will switch to a different manufacturer. ... the response just confirms you are forcing me to enable a tracking ID for a feature I don't want or use."
The new app is forcing me to sign up to a two stage verification. However the verify button isn't working and even though I've contacted Samsung customer support twice I'm not able to get it up and running. Never an issue before this upgrade. Really disappointed.
This app is useful if you fit into the box it is designed for. The fact that it can't be adjusted to reflect pregnancy is highly disappointing. I hate to use an app that labels women healthily gaining weight as obese or overweight in their second and third trimesters. Irresponsible.
"Need to bring back third party application integration. Users want more integration, not less. Your app is not best in breed for every category, that's why users rely on other applications to fill the gaps. Will have to move to a more open and interoperable platform."
"Flexible and consistent. I'm counting steps, and it lets me track for various time periods and compare myself to others all over the world. Can pick a friend or just track your own progress. Very responsive. (Galaxy Note 9)"
"I had been using this app since November 2019 after struggling for years with my weight. I got down over 50 lbs! The updates since summer 2020 removed the weight management tool and has gotten continually worse since. If you are looking for an older APK the version you need before the app went completely down the toilet is 6.10.0.041 Best of luck! Dear Samsung, I will not be keeping new versions until you fix what you broke. Piss off. You haven't listened to us."
"Now removed due to request for access to phone calls. I have read Samsung's reply but it doesn't make sense. Clearly they can verify the phone other ways - its a Samsung phone! Used Samsung Health for many years and really appreciated it, but now i'll stick with my Garmin app only - suggest Samsung figures this out or will they'll lose more users. Update, i've just received a reply from Samsung (see below) but it is just a 'cut and paste' reply and the same as everyone else has had. Sorry - No!"
"One of the worst applications I have had the displeasure of using. Constantly freezes rendering it unable to start forcing the user to uninstall then reinstall. With the latest freeze, uninstall and reinstall application now hangs after loading user and password details and will not move further. If you want to retain your sanity do not use this application."
"This app was great, until the 2 step protection update. Now it will not let me on. I get a code sent to my phone, and it goes back to the previous page. Try it again, same thing. I can't get passed the 2 step process. Yes, I tried updating my phone and uninstalling and reinstalling the app. So, I can't, even, use it anymore. I have tried the code, so many times, it called me with a code, instead of text. So, try again developers."
"The most annoying error has to do with tracking vitamin A in the Nutrient Intake Summary. If you eat kale or leafy greens like you're supposed to, it dings you 15 points off your Nutrient Balance Score for supposedly eating ""too much Vitamin A."" But it does not distinguish between intake from plant, animal or pill sources. This is bullshite because you don't actually get Vit A from plants, you get the precursors that your liver uses to make the vitamin. You cannot get too much vit A from plant sources. I get a score of only 85 all the time because I eat healthy. That's dumb. Another prob is, if you are in Weight Management mode and you do some extra workout it will scold you for not eating enough; then if you eat something, it will give you the angry red highlighted number of going over target. Last prob is, it doesn't automatically add walking to your calorie-burning stats in Weight Management. You have to remember to tell it you're walking, and remember to pause and finish when you hop in the car. It's annoying for those 3 minute walks to the parking lot, etc. Otherwise, no complaints and I do recommend the app for general purposes. If you expect something better, buy an expensive Garmin watch or something."
No longer records live heart rate data during exorcise. What's the point in an expensive wearable with an expensive phone when the companies own health app won't record the most vital data. As things stand right now I feel cheated spending money on these devices. (Edit) the number in samsungs resopnce is useless as I'm in the UK. I have spent two day in chat and on the phone trying to resolve the issue and all that's happened is I've lost all my ride data that was stored in the app.
Step counter not accurate. Everytime you stop you have to remember to make it start counting again! Invariably you forget! Also walking exercise is not accurate either! I regularly walk for 2 and 1/2 hours pass at least 3 mile markers and according to the app I've only walked .9 of a mile! How is that possible! Active minutes is rubbish as well especially for the distance and I walk!
"The app has continuously improved over the years to become the best overall health app. It's not for super athletes who want to know minute details, but it's a fun, easy to use and comprehensive app. It even has fun competitions. The only drawback is that it doesn't work with non-Samsung watches."
"I'd like to know why can I only add 100 different foods in the ""my food"" category. No one is going to stick with a few foods every time, and for such a large company, it's surprising that they don't have a larger food database, specially for foods outside of the US. Also, I do miss the ability to distinguish my activities between walking and exercise like the app had before. Do you have another way to contact you? I cannot call a 1-800 number and it's ridiculous to not have email."
"I use this app with Samsung galaxy wearable watch. Worked well until the latest update. Tells me to get moving when I'm already moving. Also, where has the walking person disappeared to? Might sound petty, but it seems like you have downgraded instead of upgraded. He used to walk along your steps and hold the gold shield when you have achieved your goal. Please bring back."
It has been repaired to its formerly great app although I was very unhappy that it took 2 months for you to repaire a mistake you made which took me 10 minutes to notice and another 5 to see what you had done. I took 1 star off for that as well as your response gave me a wrong number and was tech support. I didn't need help to use it.......I wanted to know when it would be repaired which you have now done. So thanks for that at least
"REPLY: To use Oximeter I have to use the measure multi now, there's no choice My Galaxy App version of Samsung Health doesn't work properly & it crashed constantly when using the stress level meter, heart rate & oxygen saturation level combined. I uninstalled & reinstalled & tried a few things but finally deleted it from the Galaxy Store & reinstalled from Google Play it worked again. Obviously the new update isn't working. I think it's back to normal again & it still kept my records thankfully."
its been disgraceful. i have now disabled it. it gave a prompt every minute or so saying 'samsung health can't be opened on a routed phone'' this completely destroyed any attempt to use this phone in any capacity i never thought a company app would cause such havoc. It has drained my data resulting in me needing to me purchase a rare additional package of data. I honestly can't quantify how much of a problem this has caused resulting in my phone being unusable.
Could be used in the past without Samsung account. Recent update changed that so i can't use the app anymore. Some of my phone features (Note 9) only work with this app. I refuse to set up yet another account just to use pre-installed apps that came in with the phone. Not sure if all the data the app collected can be removed or is it owned by Samsung?
"I expecter just a step tracker, but a friend showed me you can do challenges alongside the community, digest articles (and vids, I think?), and challenge friends! I do wish a little more info was shared between friends other than steps that week, or that there was some kind of more...interconnection. Also that distance was covered. But challanges, steps, friends, activity levels, and exp...pretty solid üëåüèø"
"Application now no longer works at all (you cannot even open it). The background service keeps crashing as well (which is pointless, since you can't open the application at all). Doesn't even work after clearing cache. Definitely not tested sufficiently."
"Running pace is absolutely non sense. When I ran 21km at average pace of 7:48min/km on strava, samsung health shows 5:09min/km. And distance is almost 1.6 times more than actual distance. Don't know when Samsung will correct it. It always show wrong data and now it has reached the bottom of inaccurate data."
"Stopped syncing until I upgraded, and then I needed to give it permissions for literally *everything* to even open the app anymore, makes no sense and not cool. Update: now my watch has stopped recording my sleep and I have no idea why, 2 nights in a row now (and a long nap) with just no data recorded üò°"
"Changing my rating to a 1 star because of all the updates removing all the features I liked to use or making it more difficult to figure. I used to like seeing the track after you recorded a walk, run, hike or ride on the bike. Also the ribbon of ads at the top is disappointing"
"The new update, has a bit more complicated design in my opinion. Keep it simple. Particularly, I would like the ability to change the daily heart rate graph from a bar graph to a line graph. A line graph better demonstrates if there are any changes in my rate I should be concerned with."
I used to love this app for tracking steps and bike rides. Recently I noticed that my normal step counts were being shorted by thousands of steps. This is very frustrating for my workouts. Upon investigation I noticed when I have the app open that certain ads pop up and my steps are either not tracked or aren't giving an accurate reading. Please fix.
"If you have your phone and a Samsung watch, you will get double counts on your steps and other work out. Sucks when you want the heart monitor from your watch and the ability play music from your phone. Oh and after the last update the app requires all sorts of access to your phone, and setting up and account."
"Not loading at all. I have just bought a Samsung active 2 and needed the app on my Pixel, it's not loading at all. I get to enter my details and then it just freezes on the loading screen forever. I'm so disappointed... I can't even use my new Samsung watch for the fitness purpose I bought it!!! I might even return the product as it says it's compatible with other Android phones but other futures also don't work......"
"Since the update it has been using extreme battery life compared to prior to the update. In addition while out for a,walk and walking at a good pace it continuously goes into pause mode. Again this did not happen prior to this update. I am not happy with this app right now. Please so another update asap to fix these issues."
"The update eliminated the ability to see weekly and monthly weight averages. It gives a very delayed ""weekly summary"" which shows weekly weight average, but doesnt show real time weekly and monthly averages like it used to. This was 95% of the reason I used this app, so it's now pretty pointless for me."
"can't figure it out..there's no ""start button"" to count the steps. its just dumb. ok..so here it is.. I got a new phone, this app. came w/it, I do the same walk twice a day, about a quarter way thru my walk, i get a notification stating it started counting my steps 15 mins ago...cool. the sunset walk it didn't count any steps, I clicked on icons, menu section is pointless too, shows nothing to reset or restart or start counting steps. this app gots a mind of its own and I can't figure it out."
I've used this app for 4 years and even just got my wife to start using it simply for the weight management feature that is now completely gone with this last update. Please bring that back! I was using that daily to manage my activity and calorie levels. If this isn't back in a few days I'll have to go find something else to replace. Hate to lose years of history on this app. Why would you take away the key feature many people want this for???
"So far I have bought a Samsung flag ship phone every time I upgraded but I am thinking the S10 may be my last. I am so fu#$ sick of them releasing a great product and then doing regular ""upgrades"" to remove features. I used to love the SpO2 measuring service. My phone is equipped with the hardware and released with the ability to do it for years but now, with all of the ""updates"" it is gone. Well done idiots!"
Hundreds of steps are not counted. It would be alright if it missed a couple here and there but it misses 40 or more steps in a row. Then it will give me maybe 10 of those steps after it lags. Hard to keep a correct calorie count when this happens pretty regularly.
"Eh, I'm not too please with the changes. I can't invite my Samsung Health friends to join the monthly challenges. And there were a few of us that would do it together and challenge each other opposed to one on one challenges. Not as fun as it used to be. I forgot to mention how displeasing it is to not be able to measure my stress or heart rate from the app. That drops it a star, and I will be contacting."
"Stopped working when my phone (OnePlus 6) got the Android 10 update. Now it crashes a few seconds after loading or does not load at all. This app then also causes a freeze of my phone, which usually can be recovered after a minute without restarting the phone, but the app is totally useless for me now. Besides that, when you are used to Fitbit then this app is three steps back in app stability and usefulness. And why do I have to use the US food database in Amsterdam? No way to change."
"I have turned off ALL notifications from within the app AND I have turned off notifications from the app manager. I originally wanted only badge notifications. But no matter what it has a notification on the app icon EVERY DAY telling me things I do not care about! I should be able to track my steps, etc IN PEACE! Shame on you Samsung!"
Loved the app until the latest update. Now it wants access to make phone calls and to manage files and my contacts. I've been monitoring the responses from Samsung to other reviews and they have yet to adequately explain why they need that kind of access. Take the hint Samsung and eliminate the need for those permissions. I've deleted the app.
"update: uninstalled, reinstalled & it worked for a week or so. today it started the same mess about my rooted phone that isnt actually rooted and kept rebooting and crashing the app while it was trying to update until I was able to intervene fast enough to force stop and uninstall. I dont have time to call and sit on the phone for techs to troubleshoot Was great until it started telling me ""for security reasons"" it cant ""run on a rooted phone"" when my phone isnt and never has been rooted."
"I'd been using this app for years & loved it a lot, but this past week, I keep getting voice notification of workout paused, workout resumed, when I didn't set anything on. Can help guide me how to turn this off? It's interfering my daily use when I'm on my phone. Tks in advance for any guides/steps to solve this problem."
"The challenges are impossible. There are many who ""cheat"" steps not sure how they do it but someone that gets over 600,000 steps in 4 days must be super human. I like many of the app features but prefer my fitbit when it comes to challenges, wish it was compatible with my phone."
Lots of good features but very disappointed to see the weight management widget has been removed. I recently tried the Calm app within Samsung Health and l find it very difficult and cumbersome to access Calm features. It also keeps playing sounds even after the app has been closed by swiping up. Using Calm with Samsung Health needs some improvement.
"The app has stopped recording steps. I have already changed my phone to not optimize the app and it has full permissions. The previous version was better. I've switched to a simple Pedometer App so I don't lose my step count! Also, BRING BACK THE OLD DESIGN!"
"Every morning, regardless, SO MANY Alerts and reminders! Thought I had muted awhile ago, but in the past month, I have received 7021 REMINDERS that I had no idea where they came from ((I had to mute all my notifications, missing some very important texts because I drove myself insane trying to figure out which app or apps I had asked to remind or alert me to something)) until my 14 y.o. son said Mom, its the lady at the top that is your Samsung Health.... and sure enough, it was. Uninstalled"
"Most recent update, no longer able to track weight trends beyond past week. Makes that functionality about useless. Edit: Went through motions of clearing cache and force closing even though it's obvious by other reviews that functionality has flat out been removed. Did nothing to help. Feature still gone."
"Took away the weight goals which was really my only reason for using the app. Without it, you basically just record what you do without much reason, as the weight goal would tell your if you had too little or too many calories for a day to help you to your personal goal. I really hope this feature returns"
I've been trying to get the ECG app to work on my Galaxy Active 2 Watch but it just doesn't work! The blood pressure monitoring works ok. I have called Samsung support on numerous occasions and always get cut off. This is very disappointing Samsung. Sort out the functionality!
"Continuously failing update. I keep getting a notification that this app has failed to update. I try to manually install the update but that fails, so I clear it from the list, only for it to reappear the next day. It is blocking automatic updates of all my other apps because it keeps failing every single day."
Used this app all the time and like many other reviewers I promptly deleted it once it required access to my phone. There is no function in the app that requires access to the phone and its an obvious overreach for permissions. Samsung continues to try to drive me away from their products. This is just the latest instance. The obviously disingenuous customer service responses to similar complaints have only weakened my trust that they do not intend to harvest data.
"Don't update the app! In last version Samsung has blocked the use of the app, without singing in to Samsung account, and collect your personal information! You can't skip it! Also, some features has been disappeared. Uninstalling. I will never buy a Samsung device again."
"I liked the application up until the moment when Samsung started to push their ad into the home screen of Samsung Health. In the application settings I have of course opted out from ""Marketing notifications"", yet primary spot of the application home screen is dedicated to the message that I should buy Galaxy Watch 3. I do have New Samsung Watch since two weeks and I really don't need the another one. I rang the Samsung support and with appologies they said they could not help me. Very disappointing."
"This app was perfect. The last update literally ruined everything. Will no longer connect to my Galaxy watch. Will no longer hold my personal data. (Cal per day, etc) Micronutrients won't work anymore. Severely disappointed considering this app used to be so good I had Apple users download it. Hope it's fixed soon or myself and many others will be in search for another, working, app."
"I enjoy the app and monthly challenges. I wish the Samsung food tracker imported my meals logged through MFP to save time since MFP is more robust and easier to use, but I like that my workouts and steps sync and upload to MFP so I track my eating and calories that way. Overall using the step and workout tracker is a nice, visual way to stay motivated."
"It is becomming useless app. Instead of actually developing useful features they just remove them or totally screwing them up. Forcing permissions of the contacts (seriously why..), two step verifications that are not working properly setting it up. Now every single time s account log in pops on my phone when something happens on my watch. Will be looking for alternative because Samsung seem to have monkeys on keyboard that have no idea about user needs"
This app was great until a few weeks ago when they removed the weight management feature. Now I can't tell if my calories in vs calories burned is in the target range... I'm trying to find a replacement app because that was the dumbest thing to change. I had come back in to modify my comments after reading the LONG list of people unhappy with the last update. There's no way you still have 4.2 star rating after all the crappy input. New updates: more stuff removed and nothing better. Good job.
I especially like the audio guide functionality when it gives me information about my current and average speed when cycling. Recently audio guide will only tell me information about the elapsed time and distance but all things related to speed are not called out anymore. I have checked all options concerning the Audio Guide but was not able to find which items will be called out. Is there anything I can do to fix this?
"I'm not able to access the app, i have tried various things, nothing has worked. I've sent a messages to the support tea, they said my phone had been tampered with and therefore i couldn't use the app., it was a new phone.i got fro,m and O2 store so i thought maybe it the smart watch, i got a new one from the store and i still have the same issue. I'd love to use the app but i cant even get on it."
I'm using this app on Oneplus phone and it just keeps crashing during the workout session. When ever i start the workout session it just get paused automatically after every 1-2 minutes and even time i restart it does the same . I m just using this app because of galaxy watch else it the worst app to record your workout session.
"The app is flawed. The data gets transferred for a week in the phone and then it stops. I have to reinstall the watch all over again to get the data on my phone. The steps count is never correct on the phone, its always less. Samsung please do something about this health app of yours."
"Forced to remove the app. Will update too much when I'm trying too look at other things. Very annoying for the phone to go off every two seconds, and have the notification bar say the app is updating. Ok to update once a night. But don't keep on and on with it."
"I have just changed my phone from an S8 to an A90. I had loads of features on my S8 which I used almost daily, Heart Rate monitor, blood oxygen level and stress monitor. However these features have been removed and I am disappointed by this. I have given it 2 stars as it has kept some of the previous features but the features I used the most have been removed. I am seriously thinking of going back to my S8"
"1. When i open thE app i shoud see my total calorie budget/day, food calories already gained during the day, food calories remaining, calories burned using physical activity. 2. Interface is extremely complicated. It takes hours to figure out how things work. 3. SIMPLE INTERFACE!!! CALENDAR, i can log in to any day, and manually edit my food and workout. 4. Excersizes are good. So this app is good at tracking calories burned during various excersizes. Overall app sucks."
"It's fine, I guess. It works for the most part but both the User Interface & User Experience are not great & could use a lot of improvement. Why are there always ads at the top of the screen? Did I buy a Samsung watch to receive ads for Samsung products, H&R Block, HelloFresh, & others? Yes, those are ads. As well, there's a spam message I received that I've no way to delete (from what I can tell). Also, why aren't there widgets for things like water counter? Update: Yes, Samsung ads are ads"
"This used to be a nonissue entirely when I was allowed to disable health nudges and workout notifications, but no tinkering with the settings or resetting of the watch or forums found with Google can get this watch to stop notifying me about my great workouts, constantly and causing great annoyance, while I'm at work. I used to be able to use my watch to filter incoming calls and messages without having to stop working but now that Samsung decided to allow less control, force notifications, and prevent the step counter from being turned off, the watch is constantly notifying me any time I pause to distract me from my work with unwanted workout information. Now I'm in the market for a new watch and the canned, heartless response with a phone number wont help any more than it did for anyone else."
"I am no longer able to view my weight min,max,average over the week or month etc. since the last update. This feature has been removed! This is the main reason I bought this phone and the Galaxy Active watch also. Now I'm just upset. Edit.. 29Jan21 I see you have an update but issue still not resolved. Hopefully soon the feature will be put back. I'll adjust my rating then."
Pointless app. They have zero features REQUIRED for a health app. No tracking of calories burned for day. Stop taking away features and create more features in line with an app compatible with the whole purpose of the app and having a Samsung watch. Going back to Fitbit and my versa now and my galaxy watch is being returned.
Samsung Health Walking app is so inaccurate that I'm looking for another app that is more accurate. I walk 3 miles everyday and the times it tells me at every half mile range from 2.2 to 4.4 miles per hour. There is no change in my pace. The last version was much better.  Please fix this.
Really nice App with lots of features and information insights that other Apps charge a subscription for. Loving the integration with the Galaxy Watch 4 Classic that i've just got. My only issue with it so far is the lack of a barcode scanner for adding your food information... adding this feature would make the App 5 stars.
"Latest update trashed all of my settings. App is now slow and invasive requesting numerous permissions that it doesn't need. Won't sync with the watch anymore either. Roll it back now. I don't know what kind of ""improvements"" the last update brings since it's basically unusable. Get rid of all the bloat and make the app decent again."
"It stopped measuring heart rate on 14.08.2019. Even if you are awake during daytime, it records you as asleep. Sometimes, it didn't record active time and steps taken. Many times, for the same distance travelled, it recorded different distances with big difference. If you are doing stretching exercises, it doesn't record active time etc."
Overall the app is really great is it syncs well with all my devices only downside to this app unlike most of my favourite food tracking apps it does not support a barcode scanner feature and the food database is missing alot of things. This app could be amazing if the devs worked on the food tracking a little more. If I got a update for a bar code scanner for foods I would have no problems rating this 5 stars
"Used to be a great app, really enjoyed using it. However, after the latest update, they require two factor authentication and access to your phone, contacts, media files, location etc with no option to decline. Shame."
"Love the tracker. I absolutely hate the app. Forced advertisements, the sync is horrible. Food tracking stinks. Again, I love the watch. The app is a huge disappointment. Going back to Fitbit. Hopefully this criticism encourages them to change the app. Love the trackerüò•"
"What happened to be able to record Oxygen Levels & Stress Levels? This was such a helpful app, now all I can record is my weight & bp. (I only used 4 options).UPDATE: Response email to their response:""Um, I live in the States. And there isn't anything for the Stress, but I am more concerned about my Oxygen.By the looks of ALL the recent negative reviews (not many positive ones) 88.2% of users are NOT happy with this update.Why break something that was working GREAT?"" I think app will be deleted."
Nice app. Just switched from a fitbit to a galaxy watch and am now using Samsung Health. It captures most of the same data and works well. PLEASE update the women's health section to allow us to add and see data that is over a year old. I have years of menstrual data that I don't want to lose.
"Functional but lacking ability to edit steps. On the treadmill, I dont have my phone in my pocket, steps are not counted. The app should let me enter this manually. After android OS update, Samsung health thinks my phone is rooted and won't open. My phone is not rooted, the only change is the new OS update. You would think they would test thier software with thier own phones!"
"The removal of the SpO2 function is a serious black eye on the app, it was one of my dad's most used feature on his S8. Consider adding it back to how it was before version 6.5.xx. As he has stayed on the older version, defeating the point of the new updates. I am sure this was not the intended effect."
App keeps crashing since last update. Don't like the changes to some of the graphics which make it harder to understand. If you accept a challenge it can backdate your steps to 1st thing in the morning or not start till the next morning.
After recent update(s) S Health (version 6.6.0.029) keeps eating battery (Samsung Galaxy S7) consistently taking the first place for Battery Usage (beating even Screen). Updating steps takes sometimes several minutes. I've been using the app for several years and never faced that before. Please have a look and fix. Thanks.
"Good evening all, I have previously rated 1 star and would do less if it was an option! Agreed, all updates have destroyed this app! Can anyone advise if there is a good alternative in the Google store? Pay or free just as long as its better than this one!! It's also clear that looking at all the Samsung replies that they are automated and no one is actually bothered about the complaints. Shame, as it was so good once upon a time. üôÅ"
"Why don't the features like oxygen level and pulse features work now? I used to be able to check my pulse, but can't any longer. Is it because I upgraded to a Samsung galaxy 20 phone? You used to be able to put your finger on the camera and it would measure pulse, oxygen level and stress level. Not any more. Please tell me how to turn that back on."
Version 6.20 it's definitely a step back. Previously it was a quite solid app without significant issues (except lack of activity editing featute). Since 6.20 it has become much less visually friendly with some glitches like a scrollbar which overlaps cards and some other elements e.g. new events indicator.
"Generally good app, but doesn't include options, such as gardening, push mowing, vacuuming etc which are more appropriate for actions undertaken by users that are unlikely to go to a gym or of an age not to play football, tennis etc. For example, I spend 4 hours each week pushing a heavy lawn mower, but there is no consideration given to such activities. Similarly, sawing firewood is very energy dependent; so, include these activities and the app will be twice as useful as it is at present."
"I casually use this to track health-related things, but I was really excited to see that they added a period tracker. I wanted to consolidate and get rid of another app I've been using. However, it won't let you add periods over 21 days long. If your periods are messed up and freakishly long like mine sometimes are, tracking every single day is important, and unfortunately you can't do that with this app."
The weight calculation in the weekly summary is wrong since the last update. It seems to use the weight of the Sunday after the summary week and highest and lowest are also wrong. Updated after response from developer to clear cache. Have done that with no visible change to the weekly summary. Will see if it is ok in the next summary.
"It's a nice app and it has helped me keep track of my eating and weight loss. However, it needs to add more workouts to the list, such as gardening, zumba, trap cardio, tricep extensions, kneeling one arm rows, etc. There's a lot listed but also a lot excluded."
"Overall great app with minimal tech glitches. Would be 5 stars if it included stand-up paddleboarding (SUP). Closest activity is kayaking but SUP is a full body workout including the legs and activates the core, probably twice the calorie burn as kayaking. SUP has really taken off in popularity over the last few years and I'm surprised it's not included in this app. SUP-ers are looking everywhere for an fitness app so if updated with SUP, you'll have many pleased users!"
It is truly disappointing to have the blood oxygen saturation feature removed. It was one of the most used features of my phone. I realize that the phone has a lot of great features but removing the SpO2 feature is a deal breaker for me.
"This was a great app in its prior version, but for some insane reason they eliminated the ability to track metrics as weekly or monthly averages. No one really cares about daily weight because it can fluctuate greatly from day to day. What matters are average weights over time. Why did the developers reduce the functionality of the app? I would have given the prior version 5 stars. This one barely earns one star."
"This use to be a good app to keep track of route that I go as well as the time. But lately there is no route just a line from here to there, with a flag at the end and no info of anything. Also, many times it has went into pause and 15 seconds it shows when I have bicycled 3-4 hours."
Shows there's an update and it won't update. Always tricky to connect. Worst experience. It's been 4 months and there's no solution even after speaking and showing the problem.. Across globe people are complaining a out samsung health is not working.. Still you hardly work or respond in addressing it.. Rather you copy paste to reach support who are useless since 4 months on my concern.
"I am Samsung junkie since Galaxy s4. My concern right now is that all the stuff I have read online about the Active 2 is it has the ECG... of which the instructions o line to use it for the Active 2 doesn't match what the current Samsung Health app supports. Also it says it has trip detection, again, can't find where it actually does have this feature. I do work in retail selling Samsung products, hard to sell device I can't demo features."
"I used to regularly use the app to track # of steps, distance walked & calories burned. Following the upgrade, presumably, I cannot even open it. Also it asks for phone permission which I will not give. And please don't tell me you don't share that info. That is patently untrue since your Ts&CS clearly state you share our stored information with numerous other entities, many unnamed. Please revert to the previous version that the reviews show 98.792% of your users prefer & request returned."
"Not very good so far. Have the Fit 2 watch paired. Steps aren't accurate and don't match in watch or phone, counts you sleeping if you are in one place for a while like watching a movie or at desk, heart rate monitor isn't accurate by huge amounts sometimes (sometimes says over 150bpm while sitting, sometimes 60bpm while working out). Wish they showed net calories ( Calories taken in minus calories burned for the day)."
"Used to be great. I do not know why UV tracking and measurements were removed. I used this feature almost daily on my Note 4 in the summer. the new interface makes it more tedious to find the info you need. It's nice to have some extra information that has been added, but a core feature of my phone has been eliminated."
I used to use this app all the time and loved it. I used it just for walking and hiking alone; I never used the together feature. Now all of a sudden it wants permission to make phone calls and access my contacts. No way! Absolutely not! This app never needed that to work properly before. Change it back!
I've used this app before but this year (2020) is the first time I actually exploring it more. My friend and his wife encouraged me to by challenging me with daily jogs/walks. They beat me and gave me my first loses and now we're on challenge number two. I mentioned this because after a few weeks of this I'm noticing improvements in my sleep and workout habits! Using this app makes working out like a friendly game that's great for daily motivation.
It record inaccurate information period and when you try to delete it won't allow you to. Also failed to detect watch which defeats the purpose of having a smartwatch. This software needs to be a lot better if you want to continue to encourage people to purchase.
This app used with the Galaxy watch has transformed my life!! Never did i think that a watch on your wrist and this app could do do much for your health. I have been spurred on and encouraged. Added elements like challenges and good intake. Plus weight monitoring. Lost 2st 3 months and am feeling do much more alive and energised. Addicted
"Since the upgrade, I can no longer open the app despite clearing cache, force stop, uninstalling, reinstalling, turning phone off and on, asking for help, etc. I can't access any prior data because of this. I have Google Pixel phone. I loved the old version of app. The upgrade is useless for tracking my health."
"Excellent. However, I just bought the new Note 20 Ultra and found out that that in the Samsung Health, the Stress Measure button does not show. Another comment is that the App does not count stair steps as stairs climbing. It is unfortunate to remove such excellent option; stress,oxygen and pulse testing. üòîüòîüòî"
"Rubbish, the last up date has spoilt it, it doesn't work well, maps don't show where I go on walks or runs, no UK supermarkets food choices in the food settings so every meal has to be broken down and entered put in, like I have the time for that! Shame, if they had a decent app I'd by another fitness watch but there's no point now ‚òπüò°"
"The app isn't as good as it was before the latest update. I've been walking about the house on and off today and it says I've only done 15 steps! It used to be much more accurate. Also it no longer appears to be possible to customise the icon on my home screen, which was possible before the the update. I want to make it transparent, so that my wallpaper is visible through it. It would also be brilliant if it was possible to shrink it, to 1 x 1 size, instead of 1 x 4. Please fix it!"
it's a good fitness app. There is a lot of people that cheat the system. I push myself harder everyday and made is to 1st place then I get booted for unusual high steps per day. and could not be in the challenge for the rest of the month.The goal is to be fit and I've worked hard to be in 1st. I hope Samsung can review these people better so the ones that are doing it the honest way get the reward.
Was using this app to track my trends and the latest update has removed this functionality. Not sure what the point of a health app is if you cannot look at trends. I don't need an app to give me point in time health info. Very confusing. Always liked samsung phones built in heart rate hardware with this app. Will no longer need to buy Samsung for my next phone. Cheers.
"Really like many features. There are a lot of people that seem to game the step counter so when you hit the goal some people seek impossibly far away. Maybe all the do is walk? Who knows. But it's all great motivation, and has helped me working to get back into shape."
"If I could give this ZERO stars for a rating I would. I go to open the app to see how many steps I have, agree to privacy policy is lit up. So I tap on it, then this little bity message comes on and disappears "" you must go to settings for this function "" ( something like that ). I have gone to settings a hundred times and CANNOT find whayt I am supposed to do there! I am done with this and Uninstalled it . Don't have time for nor need the aggravation !"
"This is a great health & fitness tracking app. Although you can totally use it as a standalone service, I love how it also acts as a hub for other apps to plug data into to see everything all in one place. Very powerful & intuitive."
"Hey guys. I love using the app and find it useful, but the one thing I've been using most has disappeared with the latest update - I'm doing a cycling challenge, and before the update, I could access my monthly distances through the 'trends' tab under the Cycling section but it's disappeared and I now can't easily find that information anymore (same for all types of exercise). Please can you put that back, it was really useful for keeping track of what I'd done."
"This app is horribly managed. Used to work great a year ago. Now every update either removes features or breaks existing ones. Search is basically dead, even on items that auto fill. Every time I open it, it bugs it and crashes until I open a second time. Poor product management"
"I am doing this latest update and it has stopped at 99% and will not go any further, I have stopped it and started it again and again took Wi-Fi off and put Mobile Data on and also switched off Bluetooth and location and it is still stopping at 99%. It's ok now it has finished updating."
"Calorie counter? The whole reason I downloaded this app is to count my calorie intake and caliries burned throughout the day. It doesn't do that anymore. I hate when updates change the very features I enjoy. Please bring back the calorie counter tab the way it was before. Until a new update fixes this issue, I'll have to use another app. 10/04/20, Still no update to fix the issue. This app is completely useless to me without the calorie intake tracking throughout the day."
"The app WAS The best. NOT NOW BAD RECENT CHANGES FIX THIS SAMSUNG!!!!! AWESOME THINGS THEY REMOVED 1) Weight and Calorie to activities tracking. You could set a target for weight loss and it would track calories in and out and have a Blue, Green,Red type dial if you were below, on track, or over calories. This was awesome and would keep you on track to meet your set goals. 2) Weight averages. You used to see week and month averages. Now only daily. Fix these, it was a 5 star app before."
Auto detect workouts is greyed out and it doesnt seem to wanna track with my Samsung galaxy active 2 watch.. only way it work is if the watch is disconnected from bluetooth. Being disconnected leads to the other functions of my watch not working. Auto detect has worked no problem until the latest update came out. How can i get this funtion to work properly again?
"Used to work well, but recent update seems to have screwed it so it now does not display any data. It keeps counting steps, but doesn't display them until I force-stop the app and restart it. I'm now having to do that virtually every day. Please fix this. Update following Samsung response: Please provide a UK number."
"The app good but some options are required to make it more effective: 1. Interval training for running both in time as well as in distance. 2. Workout Plan for running 5km, 10km, HM and FM, with proper schedule say 10 weeks to 26 week. 3. In Trends only weekly and monthly are available, it is better to add yearly also."
pretty good app. it does all the other apps does for tracking exercices. only problem is the together challenge. with the ammount of cheaters its impossible. 200k steps in a month its too easy but seeying ppl doing that half a day is a bit frustating and makes me loose all the mood cuz unless you are a good hacker you will never reach the first thousands of players in the competitions.
It was a great app until the update on the 5th August when the 'Weight Control' feature was removed. It was the best thing (maybe the only thing worth having) about the app. I sent 2 queries about this through the app and didn't receive any reply. Very disappointed.
"Used to work fine. The app is now intentionally broken by Samsung with the latest update unless you give it an unnecessary amount of permission to steal your private data. Honestly, why does a fitness app need to collect personal data on who speak to on the phone? Talked to customer service, and they tried to give some BS excuses, but no answer as to why they are collecting this data, and no way to disable it. We are just supposed to trust them. Dont install the latest update. It is SPYWARE!"
"Why is there still no way to scan your food in the app with a barcode?! Every other app like samsung health, (like fitbit etc) had this ability. Make it easier for users to keep track of things instead of having to type in everything, please!! Also, I bought a Yunmai Premium scale because the app said it was one of the approved ones to work and link with the app. However most times it will not connect and the information has to be entered in manually. Please fix these issues!!"
I didn't realize the way I was living. found this app and everything changed. It provided a way for me to collect all my food and exercise information and took all the guessing away. which it turns out I'm a terrible guesser. I've lost 44 pounds so far and still counting.
"I don't know about you guys, but my perception is that, every time a major update for this app comes out, instead of improvements, I see functions going away. For this new version, the weigh management section no longer shows a graph with the average of the week or month."
Why my active time (on location map) isn't active on app ?
"This used to be a good app. The last update ruined it. Don't know what they did, but it hangs on the splash screen more often than not. When it does work, it frequently stops working mid-workout. Lost 3500 steps yesterday, and today a 50-mile bike ride vanished. 274 active minutes and NO exercises. SMH."
"Decent app but now they won't let you use it unless you grant it the ability to make phone calls. There is no good reason AT ALL to allow this. App is literally unusable - as in, I cannot use it unless I give it permission to make calls. Replies say that this is only for 'a better overall service experience' & not to make calls. If it's only for Samsung Together then don't make people who don't use that give permission. Going by the review bombing, I'd say this was a catastrophic choice."
"Limited Options. When taking a heart rate, there is no option for ""during exercise"". Noting the Samsung watch struggles to take a heart rate on demand, specifically whilst exercising, this feature limits the apps recordability. Also, no option to trend over a year is pretty poor."
I had 5 stars on this app and like many people I have to change it after the update. I think it is not only a pity but even bad for people that you cant see your wheight average anymore. For those of us tracking weightloss it is better to consider month to month as losing weight too fast is dangerous. Been using this app for more than 5 years and I have to stop. EDIT: thank you for your answer. I still have the app and will be on the lookout for user friendly updates. Would love to use it again.
I've been using this since I was 16 to count calories and my exercise and just got my first samsung active watch. Its amazing having the watch calculate everything but the app works perfectly fine without the watch. It's an easier way to see how active you are and how much you eat during the day.
"I absolutely love this app. I just really wish there was a ""women's health"" option for tracking cycles, ovulation, etc without having to download another app. That is also compatible with the Samsung watches. I would LOVE to have this! Otherwise, the whole app is amazing. I love the symptom checker & access to online resources & doctors."
"App is great but there is an issue with watch faces for the new Galaxy Watch 4. The app is not providing the data it should as a widget (icon, text with value), and it only provides a static ""Heart rate"" text, with a link. It behaves more like a shortcut to the app and not an actual widget. Please fix this!"
"It worked well for a while. Some accuracy questions. 2 of us with same app walk same distance but get slightly different results. Now l'm locked out b/c it asks me to log into an account l never set up. Won't give a set up or reset option, bye bye."
"I am really disappointed of the last changes in the weight feature. Why you deleted the possibility to see the weekly and monthly average, min/max weight??? They were really helpfull for analyzing the trends to understand the reasons for the changes. The daily fluctuations often don't matter. Please bring it back!!!"
Horrible update. It is using too much phone battery now. My phone is now overheating due to this app. It is using 14% of my CPU and says it needs to be closed. I have had to uninstall it. It is no longer syncing to Myfitnesspal. People use this to accurately monitor calories in order to lose weight. Do not take that function away. This is a very large consumer dissatisfier. Please fix ASAP! There has been a large issue with every update which is unacceptable. Don't tell to call just read and fix
"I being using this app since I had galaxy S6, and I upgraded to a new galaxy a couple of times works perfectly, it is a great app to track your steps. It was working fine until today, I did my 3 miles daily walk, recorded over 6k steps, I keep it with me a day to keep counting my steps and for some reason it is not adding all the steps, I should have over 11k and it's only showing over 5k and it's totally ignoring the walk steps. I try restart my device and it's not working."
"SpO2 - it's still there Jeff Bower, you note O2 monitor has gone. I too was annoyed by this, but if you run the stress test, it measures Heart rate and SpO2, giving a reading for both. I think the stress result is a flight of fancy, but the O2 reading is there, and that's what we need to know. Would be nice to put it back as a stand alone though Samsung."
this app has major issues. My daily calorie count is always messed up. I wake up and it says I have eaten 2000 calories. It wont reset at the beginning of each day. I have to go manually delete all my meals from the prior day so I can start with 0 again. You cant set you own custom calorie intake goal which is also stupid. I expect better from Samsung
"This app looks slick and has some strong points, but it has a long list of inadequacies and could be greatly improved. I originally installed it for the SpO2 sensor, but couldn't find it. Even after the people replied here, I STILL couldn't find it (couldn't find the ""stress tracker"" mentioned, that reply was useless to me.) Also, this app is invasive about repeatedly asking permission to access contacts. The step tracker works really well. Other things though that I don't like about this app, it plasters calorie counts for workouts all over the app, and there is no setting to turn this off. My partner is recovering from an eating disorder and calorie counts can set off disordered thinking and eating behaviors and negative body image thoughts. I wish there were a setting to disable calorie counts and I wish the calorie counts were not turned on by default. Calorie counting is NOT healthy for all people. There are also a lot of other things I wish this could track. For example, I am recovering from COVID-related pneumonia, and I wish there were a way to track my breathing, like measuring breaths taken with a spirometer, and measuring various symptoms. Instead I am using a spreadsheet on my computer. Overall, this app doesn't really have many ways to report subjective feelings, like I can rate my sleep, which is sort of nice, but that's about it. This app is a good starting point but overall it looks more like a beta. My #1 priority right now would be for them to allow users to disable the calorie count. ""First, do no harm."" is a good principle of app development, and calorie counts can do A LOT of harm to people in recovery from ED's, so turning this off seems mandatory if the creators of this app are to be ethical and responsible."
"Overall disappointed. I bought a samsung galaxy watch active 2 hoping it would get ECG feature with a software update, but apparently that is only for samsung phones, all other android phones are not compatible. This is false advertising. The sleep tracking on the app has become useless, giving me maximum 15 minutes of deep sleep per night, when before the update it would give me way more. Sometimes it also doesn't even record anything. Really not happy."
"I loved using this app and even recommended it to multiple people. However, I am very disappointed with the recent update that eliminated the weight management tracker without warning. This tracker separated Samsung Health from all the other health apps due to how easy it made weight loss. Now, this app is as useless as all other health apps. I will not use this app, let alone recommended it, until this feature has been restored. I know the people I recommended it to will not use it, either."
"Great tracking app! All in one for counting steps, tracking workouts, even keeping tabs on the food you eat and water/caffeine you drink! If you have a wearable to go with this it syncs perfectly to keep you in track to your goals! Also fun challenges to motivate you!"
"I think this is a really good app but needs more widgets, one that combines your steps and exercise and activity like the heart that's on samsung watch would be great. Also a sleep widget would be fantastic. I requested/suggested a sleep widget over 2 years ago and it was passed to the developers but we are still waiting."
"Less options with weight function since update, and can't amend previous weights/dates yet. And why do you need permission to phone? That will put some users off. I had to allow then disallow. The HIDDEN stats for steps are better than before so now I can beat my own monthly total steps each month, took a while to find though. Accurate & reliable."
"Such a great, stable and easy to use app. I love the Together challenges each month and stretch/exercise reminders. Really motivates me to get out there and run so I can hit my daily step goals. The stress and other monitors also help me be mindful of my total wellness. Great app that I use with family and friends! üíö"
"It keeps deducting my steps from my overall log. I got to 25,000 steps two nights ago and was really close to passing my friend (about 1000 steps away), only for it to set me back to 19,000! It has done this twice now and quite honestly I'm fed up. I work very hard for my daily steps, I do not appreciate the app resetting my logged steps inaccurately. Several of my friends have had issues with the app mislogging their steps too. Please fix this."
"Great app, has great reports functions and love that it fully explains what the data means. I use the sleep tracking with my watch and it's great. The only thing I feel it is really missing is a notes section, would really love to make my own comment on certain things so when I look back at a later date I have context to why certain data is different."
"I like that the app speaks to me to let me know what my average pace is. I would like this app to be able to export my maps to .GPX files. i would also like to be able to share my maps with friends that shows more than just a picture of the map, make it more interactive like other apps."
Worked great until you removed the Exercise To Calorie Burn feature under weight management. Now this app is pretty much useless. Nice job developers removing something that worked really well and set you apart from all the other calorie counting pedometers. Utterly useless now. Will be deleting it and looking at other options. Why remove something lots of us used?
"So the latest 2 factor auth update breaks the app. I've set up 2 factor. App stalls with a prompt to have to log In Again as session timed out. Eventually a Samsung login box appears and gives the 2 factor code and on entry fails or ducks out, code not accepted. Recovery codes also not accepted. App quits. Currently useless. Please fix! Have tried force close and clearing cache etc."
"HATE the most recent update (13 Jan. 2021, not October 2020 as described in Google Play). The at-a-glance layout of previous versions was great--especially to those of us who are inclined toward the visual. Now it's all tiny text. I've been using this app for about 6 years. I am greatly disappointed."
I have used this app for at least 10 years. Just replaced my Samsung phone with another Samsung mainly because I liked Samsung health. The new upgrade wants control of my calls and access to contacts and I cannot open the app unless I agree. I uninstalled the app and tried again. Still I have to give the app control of my calls which I will not do.
"It has been a very fine companion when it comes to tracking all sorts of activities, but unfortunately it is planning to stop its support to Health Sync. This is very unfortunate for me because I use Health Sync to combine my steps count data from my Galaxy watch active 2 with my Xiaomi mi Band 4. If Samsung does indeed go ahead with its restrictions, I won't be able to combine my steps count data any longer on Samsung Health. Please do look into this as the data from Mi fit app are legitimate."
"8/5/20 Update RUINED this app. I really hate giving this app less than 5 stars-- In my opinion, this was the best fitness app available. It has most (if not all) of the best features of its competitors, but the weight management feature that gave you calories under or over for your target weight goal put it in a class by itself. I bragged about it all the time to my friends working to lose or maintain weight like me. Since this update, though, it's just another fitness app, nothing more."
"Embarrassingly Awful App. You would think Samsung would have it together but no. The glitches with this app, in addition to the lack of user friendliness endemic of their suite of apps and ""smart"" technology is laughably awful for a business claiming to specialize in technology & communications. I bought the Galaxy watch to go with my phone (work provided) and the Fitbit & associated apps are exponentially superior. Do better Samsung. update: i'd axtually rate Samsung OVERALL 0 STARS."
"The worst part of this app is the horrible sleep keeping. If I go to sleep at 8:45pm and wake up for a bathroom break at 11:45, it still should show up as tonight's sleep, not yesterday's sleep. Also, I should be able to add workouts for steps (just like in the fitbit app)."
"I use this app daily. And it's a good app the only thing I dont like is when I'm keeping track of what i eat, it doesn't give me the option to pick restaurants around where I live. The restaurants that it has I never heard of.... it would be nice if it had local restaurants to pick from to keep better track of my diet."
"Firstly, I must say I loved this app. It was so helpful in achieving weight loss and generally better health, I even got the Galaxy Watch to make the experience better. But, for some unfathomable reason, Samsung have decided to remove the ""weight management"" tool from the updated app. Big mistake, Samsung. Reading reviews, people are not happy, myself included. This is an error and I implore Samsung to bring it back. It's what made S health good. Don't be surprised if people go elsewhere."
"Good app, but makes your phone bip all the time. Notification can be configured, but making it silent is taking many minutes of configuration. Why for example sleep log have to make a sound? You finally get to sleep and your phone wakes you up? What's the point?"
I know you might not even see this but i need to say something very important about this app. False top 10 list is created...how come a person covers 80-90 miles during lockdown in a single day and that is also within a few hours...all the top 10 players cannot be Usain Bolt...its just impossible and false data is being shared to samsung app...either do something about it or dont demotivate those who are counting steps without any type of cheating....global challenge sucks that way.
"Hello, where did the weight management widget go!? It was the most useful tool on the app. Also it would be helpful if the weight dashboard showed total weight gained or lost from the initial setup and not just show from day to day."
"Not sure why they TOOK OUT the oximeter which was working just fine. They also took out quick measure which isn't a big deal but still something I used. Lastly, the sleep data is not saved automatically. You must manually save it which is quite inconvenient."
"I wish you could see total distance covered for week/ month instead of average. I have to record it each day for a monthly challenge. Also would be better if you had leagues for your monthly challenge so you can compete with people who do around same steps. Being 645,876th on the list is not really an incentive!"
"I absolutely love this app!!! its it's fun to challenge my friends each month. And keeping track of my steps keeps me aware. I also love the fact that it basically gives me a health journal to record my weight, my water and coffee intake, blood pressure and oxygen. they also link to other apps for fitness support and training. I mean...Samsung is just overall amazing!!! I'd never use another brand...LOVE YOU GUYS!!‚ù§‚ù§"
"The update ruined everything. The old version was very useful and easy to use. But after the update, the app kept crashing and freezing while logging my food intake. I alwaya had to restart the app. So disappointing! It would also help if it will allow me to add more food."
"This really is an amazing app to use! I have a Samsung Galaxy S7 and it works perfectly! I am not desperately wanting to lose weight, but I cannot help using this and adding the food I eat, steps I walk, heartrate etc. I just find it so satisfying and interesting to see how I am doing"
"It's fine. The gender options are limited to male and female and the period tracking function reads ""women's health"" with no option to edit the category, and regardless of the gender the user selects in the app, the ""women's health"" category remains visible on the watch's health tracking app. This is a major oversight. Editable category names in general would be a helpful feature"
"Loved this app, using the basic walk/steps counting. Now new updates requires access to my contact. Seen the previews reviews, all getting the useless standard reply Samsung, don't bother to reply if it is the auto, "" for optimal experience, assured not sharing or using for other purpose, blah blah, blah"". You can keep your it. So long Samsung"
App is a great exercise/diet tracker. The only issue I have is the HEART RATE MEASURING.. I have a SAMSUNG GALAXY S10. It almost always takes multiple tries before im able to get a measurement. I dont know if its the beam not going deep enough into finger to pick my heart rate up or if its the app itself malfunctioning. My lens is cleaned before each use. I use alcohol pads to clean my phone regularly
"I had been tracking my oxygen for six months to show my pulmonary arterial hypertension specialist and then one day all the data was gone, b/c the oximeter was removed. The oximeter was the deciding factor in choosing this app over others, but now it is worthless. I do know I can track my oxygen levels using the stress tracker, but it takes way longer and doesn't seem to be as accurate as the oximeter function. BOO for changing it!"
I have just upgraded from my S8 where the health app worked well but now I can't access it at all. I followed the links to settings and permissions but just keep going round in circles. Disappointed üòû ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ Updated Edit 5th July 2021. I had a very quick response from the developer and the advice solved all issues it was just a technicality of clearing cache etc. Thank you for your help and the rapid reply. I am very pleased with the app üòÄ
"I like the functionality of the app for a workout tracker my only 2 complaints are: there is no option for higher intensity workouts (HIIT, boot camp, CrossFit, etc) so I don't believe the calorie count is accurate. My friend is able to set her Apple Watch to HIIT and her calorie count comes out to about 100 calories more than me. We're similar size and heart rate is similar. Also, the challenges are only for steps. Why not one for calories, or miles ran in a month, etc?"
the nutrishion portion of the app has never worked properly since I obtained the 9+ SAMSUNG MODEL. it worked fine with my 5S but it doesn't work well with the new phone. I have talked with your Tech department and they reset everything and it still does not work right . Very frustrating.
"I think this is a great app. Definitely the most accurate step counter that I have found. I did have an issue with the app not opening and then getting a message that Samsung Health would not open on a rooted phone. I rebooted my phone, which seemed to fix the problem."
"First it was the O2, Now the GPS tracker... I know each route walked is a 1-2 mile meandering loop/square depending on the turns BUT now it registers 0.23mi +/- and the map shows that it's walked in a triangle only steps from the start. The step count, even the time is questionable. I use this to track the speed & distance on dog walks. NOT happy! 04APR20: The Stress/O2 measurement keeps crashing? Why????"
"I think this is a good app for fitness and tracking steps, but I would like it better if it paired with my misfit watch. The monthly challenge is okay but I'm really bored with it after 2 weeks, maybe if they put in some variety."
"Hello , Some needed updates: 1)For Weight and and other recording have a CHARTS that shows recording history from different time ranges and one for since recording. 2)HR Monitor should have an option to run every couple hour. 3) Step counter needs to improve on watch active 2. Till 1 isn't implemented it's hard to give the application higher rating."
"I cant tell how many times the gps has failed me (again) even though I've made sure that all settings are right, since the last review I gave. This time I had to end and then open 2 separate sessions because each time (3 times) I thought the gps was following, but it wasn't! So my tracking was ruined. Today, it was useless. I'm disappointed because I was attempting a long distance running, but nothing was tracked properly."
Update: It seems like the issue has self corrected. All is well again. Why did you change how active calories burned are calculated? I'm getting anywhere from 10-18k steps a day as a Strength and Conditioning Coach and somehow it says I'm barely burning 300 active calories. That makes zero sense. Please fix this.
"In the past, this app has inconsistently tracked my steps (and when I run, miles). Today it just stopped counting at 54. Regardless of my activity, pausing and restarting the count, etc., it won't move. It's frustrating."
"I have been using the app for a few months to track weight & calories burnt. Latest update the weight loss part seems to have disappeared no more total calories burnt including Basal metabolic & now doesn't show average weight for the month just the last weight recorded. Please tell me they have been hidden somewhere & I need to turn them back on somehow. They were a great help, average weight helped monthly fluctuations. I would exercise more to try and stay in the green by the end of the day."
"I stopped using other apps because I could record different things here (blood pressure, weight, period, etc,). I was very happy until a ""private notice"" didn't allow me to use the app anymore. I called customer service, I didn't want to lose my information. But, I had to reset it and everything was gone. I am so furious!."
"To charge $200 for the Galaxy Active yet not have a better fitness tracking app that's more detailed and user friendly/easier to navigate interface is confusing to me and seems half assed. You have the fitness watch, now it's time to make the only app it's compatible with better."
I've had this app since 2014 its had its ups and downs. 1) When I tried to track my meals I found that if you're fasting it automatically inputs what you ate last.. I fast for several days often and I know many people who do so maybe a fasting category should be added. I had to install a different app specifically for fasting.. 2) While tracking steps I like to compete with other people all over the world on the fun little maps and see their journeys posts and comments.. My only problem when the competition for (200000 steps) starts there are already people with a half million steps in the first couple of days. So professional marathon runners and extreme hikers or mittens or spot with devices attached to their collars while being able to share their God given gift of being able to walk the length of about 8 cities in two days. Put different levels of people in categories so there can be a fighting chance to make it to the ocean and beyond. Levels can go by average steps per day once your average goes up you level up. Example level 1 = 1-15000 average steps/day level 2 = 15001-30000 average steps/day ect... a map should be added for runners and bikers too also active minute could have a game too people would never leave your app
"Wish my health data could be accessed from a computer, not just on my mobile phone. Laptop screen would be larger, showing more data at the same time, easier to print reports, maybe also compare data over different time frames etc."
The new update doesn't allow me to sign in to use the app at all. After I sign in it seems to load endlessly. I read other comments trying to resolve this issue and I tried the recommendations. It still did not work. This is a huge issue and limits the use of my devices. Please fix this bug. The fact that I need to bend backwards to make the app work does not mean that the app works. Very disappointed.
"Update March 2022: Still hasn't been resolved. The erroneous data is wildly comical, useless and annoying because it doesn't reflect actual sleep. Please fix. My Galaxy Active 2 watch often thinks that I'm sleeping when I'm not. In the past I was able to delete the erroneous sleep logs, but since a recent SHealth update they are now grouped together with my real sleep periods, and I can no longer delete the wrong records without also deleting the correct ones. Please ungroup them again."
"For a workout app that has been around for 6 years, you'd think something as basic and essential as user-defined max heart rate was implemented. The 220 minus your age thing is not valid for the majority of people. Until this is fixed, get a workout app that takes itself and its users seriously. Also, stay away from any Samsung peripheral like watches, as you'll have the same issue there unless you use a third party app, for which support is very lacking on Tizen."
"I used to love it because I found it to be very accurate. On my last two runs (I usually run between 10 and 13 miles per run) I noticed my Samsung watch stopped at 4.4 miles TWICE. I thought maybe I stopped my watch (I use the waterproof feature to prevent this issue) but no, it just stopped and recorded only 4.4 miles. Please fix this issue üòî"
"EDIT : Issue resolved. My mistake. Didn't add the accessories properly The app data is out of sync with my watch. It doesn't reflect the my step count on the watch, only counts those on the phone have tried clearing chace and even reinstalling the app but nothing helps."
Good but what I don't like is it resets at midnight and some of is are night owls are schedules are different from others need an option when to reset for like night and day or by a set time we can choose would be even better just something like that would help make it more accurate for the night owls just putting that out there! 4 star till then
"I love it! My only complain is that it doesn't detect cycling for me. If I cycle it measures the exercise as walking (with fewer steps and unreal speed). And you can't erase automatically detected exercises. I can manually insert cycling, but I always forget to do that. I do it afterwards and then I have double exercise - the correct manually inserted cycling + the faulty cycling that was automatically detected as walking."
"My steps were working perfectly, then all at once it stopped. Nothing I have done has got it working again. It works when it wants too. Cleared cache, data (which cleared out all my information I had stored), updated, rebooted my phone several times. Any suggestions"
I use it with my family they really enjoy trying to beat each other!! It keeps us very active. I wish that there was more interaction or like mine games or questions on the map or if they had a challenge outside of the mo rhyl challenges once your finished. But great app!!
"In the last version I can't record all my daily meals anymore, where is the morning/night snacks? I don't eat only 4 times during the day. The food functionality in Samsung health in one of the most important to me, without this the app loses great part of its purpose to me, unfortunately! Samsung, please take a look of this!!!"
This app still has more to go. I walk on a track in a gym. It does not correctly count my steps nor the actual oval I walk. This incorrectly calculates my steps how fast a walked and distance. The only thing it can get correct is when I get the start and stop button. Disappointed
"Needs an option under activity workouts for labor/working then have levels. light labor, moderate level and heavy labor. When I am doing housework, or cleaning stalls or paddocks or doing remodel work, I have no appropriate options. I like a lot of this app, but it has many holes. If I knew how to make apps, I would make one with more variable options."
"Update after trying the steps mentioned in the response - The signin is still not working for me. I have tried it a gazillion times, on different days and even after clearing cache. I am not able to reach out to you on the phone no provided, is there any way of getting in contact over email ? Overall the app is good, but one functionality isn't working for me - I'm trying to login to my Samsung account, it gives an error - Something went wrong with the server.Try again later."""
"Me and my family have been using this app for the past 5 months for weight loss and has been an excellent app for me and so far has helped me to lose a lot of weight however since the new update has taken away the weight management function, this makes it really difficult for us as that was one of the best features on the app, taking it away was unnecessary and has only made the app more difficult to use, please bring the function back so we can keep on using this app effectively"
"I really like it. Syncs easily with my watch. One thing I would really like to change is the water intake. It should allow you to put the number of ounces you drink. I have 18oz, 24oz and 36oz water bottles. Would be much easier to enter a value than try to factor in how many glasses."
I had to uninstall this cause it wasnt counting my steps and this newest update has burned almost all my battery life in one day when normally I could go two almost three days without having to charge. Have tried to clearing the cache and even tried re-downloading the app.. Will reinstall once these has been fixed. Really like this app.
Its a brilliant app. If you enter your measures properly it will give you some good feedback... Down side is it makes you carry the phone or gadgets all the times....Also there are some messed up people always on top 1000 of everything... average steps are around 10k a day but those sickos gets a result of walking 200k step a day....so it shows it's possible to cheat with app but still it's fun to have.... Also uses too much data!!!
Such a disappointing destination to remove food/calorie tracking. This app become rubbish without the ability to track your nutri intake and burns. What's the point tracking activities when unable to see and balance your macros? From 5 to 1 stars for your stupid move. I'm giving up on all Samsung accessories as well. Absolute rubbish.
"So far I really enjoy how detailed the nutrition info is and that this app pulls from a good sized data base of food. It is also visually easy to navigate and read. I would love to see more customization in regards of goals, specifically macro nutrient goals."
"Great for tracking steps, distances, heartrate, stress, etc. but it REALLY needs to be able to scan barcodes if it's going to be ANY real use in tracking food and meals. Typing in everything by hand is tedious and scanning is offered by many other apps."
I'm disappointed that the app does not show you how much weight you still have to lose. And that does not have your calorie count on the main screen of the app. To show your daily intake minus the amount of food you ate plus the amount of exercise equals how many calories you can still eat. Wish the app was more like the Fitbit app. I really hope someone reaches out to me from Samsung
"Horribly laid out, in app ads, UI is not user friendly, the data is reported in such an unintuitive way, it blows my mind. I love the watch itself, but the app is terrible and I would give it 0 stars if I could. I think I'm going back to Fitbit."
"The app its self works quite well, but I've noticed there are considerably less Samsung users using the challenge features. I suspect it has something to do with the monthly leaders being at 100000 plus steps a day which just isn't realistic. Why would you use a challenge to motivate when its a full on demotivator?"
"App would be great, but stress level function is unavailable and nowhere to be found. When I searched on forums there were no solutions, only explaining that this was a problem in a recent update. When calling Samsung technical support, they were unable to give me any solution."
My husband and I use this app daily. We have now discovered the 'Weight Management' feature has been removed. We considered this feature the most important as it helped us maintain are daily calorie goals. Please consider restoring this feature. If not we'll need to find another app that fits our needs. Also the ability to add steps manually would be helpful
"Too many ads, the food tracking feature is not well built, it doesn't have anything for weight lifters and, worst of all, it doesn't partner with other apps that do those things well. At least Android Wear can do that."
"Dropping my review becuase after your reply to my previous you clearly have no idea what you are doing with permissions, they weren't needed before and they are excessive. I was speaking about Contacts no phone, phone is not even needed for the Toghether feature, and it's only required during 2tsetp Auth, But forcing access to full contact list when we can add firends via qr code or email/SMS is ridiculous and wasn't required before."
"I used to like this app because it had a good home screen with easy to see pedometer data and no ads. The latest update puts a large ad banner at the top of the main screen. Its very annoying and no way to turn it off. Other pedometer apps have a small ad line at the bottom of the screen. I'm switching to one of them. Update: After all the neg Jan '21 update reviews, 2 weeks later there's lots of 5* reviews with only ""good app"", etc. Seems fake & someone wants to increase the app rating."
"Great app and works very well. I only rated 3 stars as I just wish there were more workout options particularly a general one for strength training, and also an option to set personal goals (eg. Walk or run 30km per week, etc) instead of just challenges with friends."
"I havent been able to use this app for almost 6 months now, keeps telling me my phone is rooted and will not load. it's a Samsung s8+ trying to use a samsung app. tired of removing it and losing my progress even tho it says you can save it with an account. looking for something better!!!"
Issues since last updates. Not sure if it's the galaxy wear update or Samsung health. Love watch but lately having issues with workouts where it keeps pausing. Like riding bike and watch keeps pausing workout. Very annoying. Otherwise love the combination of watch and app. Please fix this issue!
I like the app but one problem. When doing a training plan the app doesn't send the days workout over to the watch straight away. I'm left waiting to do a workout because it hasn't sent it to my watch even after syncing. Should be manual toggle to send the workouts over immediately
Using watch 4 now for recording while cycling. The watch just recorded the heart rate while the phone recorded mph and rpm through Wahoo speed and cadence sensors. All records were separated. I'd like to have them synchronize and merge into just one. Please improve the app. Thanks!
"INVASION OF PRIVACY BY SAMSUNG FOLKS! Just recently after updating, SAMSUNG is asking you to have full access to EVERYTHING on your phone as well as your personal information/Data (just read the ""FINE PRINT"" in the ""AGREEMENT""); hence, invading your privacy all the way around and if you don't accept it, you won't be able to use the app AT ALL, PERIOD. I DID NOT install your app but rather it was pre-installed on my phone at the time of purchase and yet does not let me to uninstall it for good."
"It's a great app, but runs like a snail at the moment. I have tried to uninstall and reinstall, but it is still so slow. This issue needs to be patched in the next update, it shouldn't take around one minute to enter the coffee I had at breakfast. Shouldn't have to call support, you already receive all the data you need from our phones."
I'm not a sports person but this app has kept me motivated to try and stay active. I really like the global challenges! The app was easy to set up and customise to my liking. It syncs with my Galaxy Watch so I can get the most use out of my wearable.
I used to love this app but the update this past week killed the functionality of the features I appreciated the most! I lost the ability to se month over month weight progress and now it no longer imports data from Noom! Other than being my default pedometer this app has no use for me anymore. Wish I could go back a version!
"App wont open on my S8+. Get a message that says, for your security the app will not open on a rooted phone. My phone has not been rooted! Even checked with the root checker app. I have uninstalled multiple times, cleared cache and data, still wont open. I called S-Health customer service and they took my info and told me they would be in contact in 2 days. It's been 2 weeks and still nothing."
Love this app but really disappointed it doesn't have a bar code scan option like other calorie counting apps. Having to use an extra app because of that. Hoping it's something that can be added in the future. That would make this app perfect in my opinion.
"Please bring back the weight management feature!! Soooo dissatisfied with this app now that it is gone! It was such a useful tool for me to make sure I'm hitting the correct calorie intake for my activity levels and wanted weight loss!! This app will get a 5 star from me if this feature is ever put back on the app. I love tracking my activities, the workouts that are available, and it's made me more aware of what I eat on a daily basis. But please put the weight management feature back on here!!"
"It always asks if I'm trying to walk before I've even gotten up, and there's no way to clear the notifications for the step counter. I do like using the exercise trackers and weight loss tracker, though."
At first it was great. After one update it constantly lost my position. I would go for a strong walk and it would lose my position constantly. I had all bars strong signal at it still lost its satellite. Samsung needs to step it up like apple or get lost in the grind.
"I used Samsung health to detect and track walks automatically, then I had to start manualy & confirm that weak gps was OK. After another update I talked to customer service. After a Force Stop of the App and deleting the Cache both in phone settings and the App, the export as gpx worked again if I started a walk manually. 4 stars. If it generated gpx files automatically as it previously did, I would give the App 5 stars. Today it quit after 21 sec, detected the walk, but only did gps for 21 sec."
Great tool to monitor your workouts. The only complaint is that the screen times out. I wish it would stay on all the time. I use it for biking and spinning and I have to constantly tap the screen so it would not go into screen save.
"Samsung Health has been working well, without a single glitch, for the pass 5 years until last week where it has failed to load. Despite the recent app updates, it failed to fix the problem. This has made me very upset as all my valuable health data, including all my hiking track records from overseas, could not be retrieved nor accessable. All Samsung call centre could advise me was to clear the cache, clear the data, restart my device without knowing if all my previous health data is preserved"
"Cannot connect to the watch.. Useless This app is absolutely useless. It doesn't recognise the watch that it was once connected too, it lags and uses up the battery. Very, very poor experience. Uninstalled it to try and reset the whole thing and no it won't let me sign back in... Useless"
"I just went from a Samsung S9 plus to a S20-5G plus. Really excited about that, until I realized the features that I lost in Samsung health. I realized the new camera replaced the sensor that was used to register, pulse, stress and oxygen levels, but these were very important to me, to help me evaluate my condition, without having to go and use the inaccurate store machines. I guess that's one way to force us to buy a $400 + dollar, watch in addition to $800 phone.Thumbs down SAMSUNG."
"In comparison to fitbit the usability of this app is terrible. How do I look at my stats from the previous day? The updated list-style display is too clunky and not nice to use as the previous grid display, there should be the option to use either one."
"Good app, but could be great with changes. If it could be used as a remote for activities recorded/ing on the phone (since only the phone can record cadence and power sensor data) and display my key stats. And if it auto launched that'd make it a 5 star app!"
"App wont even open. Keeps just saying this service is temporarily unavailable, please try again later. That's all it's been saying for weeks. (Edit July 17/20) App still not working, called the number, got told they can't fix it and to fill out something online, could barely even hear them. App had worked completely fine up until a few weeks ago, now just keeps saying ""this service is unavailable, try again/try later (0x07#-16)"". Nothing works."
"It's all been great for a long time. I wear a galaxy watch which syncs with the app. Now I've have a very inactive day. According to my watxh, 22 active minutes. The least I've done all week. But this app on my phone is saying 105 active minutes. Ita been I creasing while I've been sat down. Also through the day I've barely had my phone on me. So how is.it recording minutes when I'm sat still. My watch has been on me all day and yet its recorded a more accurate recording."
"It's a decent app but it definitely needs some different options for workouts, especially ones that will sync to the watch(I have an older watch, this might be the problem). There is no option for HIIT workouts like Orange Theory or Crossfit."
"Since last update app is useless.. it multiplies steps from my galaxy watch and mobile phone and gives completely false data. on top of that, I can't see my galaxy watch, in the app, as a source of steps. also, I can't update Health app on my watch through my Galaxy store on my s8+. When it starts installing it just break connection.... // not sure if you are aware, but there are 'couple' of users of your products that aren't based in US and unable to make the international call.."
Retarded permissions needed. Simply put invasion of privacy with no option to turn off if you want to use it in a normal way. I don't want to share etc.. thus all those extra permissions are stupid when forced to use. I guess Samsung is the next conglomerate who wants to rule the human race Instead of allowing it freedom by giving options to turn on/off parts people don't want to use (and permissions with it) Uninstalled
"After recent update the app does not work correctly. It does not sync with any other app, doesnt count my steps, doesnt add my exersice, heart rate is not being recorded, sleep app does not work at all. Unable to contact customer support as I live in the UK."
"This is a good app to track exercises, but recently it's started using a lot more battery. 15% battery in background in 7 hours, which might not seem like a ton, but doze mode I think is being kept off by it which drastically decreases battery life as a whole."
"Called the number provided by Samsung, all that was stated by Samsung was the information would be relayed to the development department. Now this app is useless... Recommend uninstall! How about an option to turn off ads. Now you want to force a two-step process instead of making it an option, if you force it I will uninstall your app and recommend uninstall to everyone I know."
"I had I phone before and I can say that the health tracker from Apple is much better than this app, has much more features. My wife still have apple products and I am considering back to apple as soon as I can. In January I bought note 10 and galaxy watch and such disappointing is the heart care apps. The cell phone is nice, the watch is beautiful and both has a good quality. But the health tracker needs so much improvement."
Suddenly requires excessive permissions with no straight answers. --- I now have the standard reply. It's doing reputational damage. You need a better reply. My hunch is that it uses access to your phone to auto fill the texted code during 2fa setup. That's a terrible reason to get the app distrusted if that is all It's for. Just make the auto fill optional!
"Too many new required permissions, canned response to concerned users from Samsung. Samsung needs to revert to the previous version where so many permissions were not required, starting to lose Faith by several users regarding this new development. I understand Samsung wants to be able to advertise and track data for future apps and usage, the bang is not worth the buck regarding this development. Samsung needs to legitimately address this issue, not just "" assure us that permissions will not be divulged to third-party and are used to provide optimal experience"". It was great the way it was as stated by every user making this comment, so that's false. Just need to revert to old version so you don't lose customer base. Samsung just needs to do the right thing here."
"ever since the last update, the app hasn't tracked my steps. i have to restart my entire phone for it to do so but it stops again after a couple of days. i tried disabling battery optimization to no avail. i feel like just giving up with this app despite its other great features."
"Overall the application and watch should count burnt calories by heart rate and duration of exercise, however when using circuit training or other workout, it always gives the same result of burnt calories etc. So circuit training eventhough intensity is really high always at 30 min gives 264 and in other workout mode 234, please work on this since with a heart rate monitor and sports watch the numbers are more accurate."
"Samsung Health has quickly became my favorite health app! The motivation in watching others succeed along with the friendly competitions gives me the motivation I need in my Pursuit to Healthiness. Being able to see the world, literally, in the community page with amazing pictures is so much better than yet another food picture on other social media sites. But as in other sites, there are people I don't wish to see their posts. 4 stars because it doesn't have the ability to block those people."
"This app is no longer fun. It allows users to submit false information in health challenges. Deleting! Update: please do something because it's not fair to thre one's working hard for fun competition. It don't appear that you guys are watching your system close enough. On day 1 of the challenge, many have already walked 200k steps? No way!"
Formerly great app has lost lots of functionality. Worst omission is the ability to see weight trends. I can't even jump to a specific date. To see my weight a year ago I have to scroll back a whole year.
"Not being able to find out what Samsung devices apps are available for and then spending the same amount of money as on a laptop only to find out your device is not compatible is very disapointing. This was the same with Samsung Soundcamp. When companies start to make it difficult or impossible for their consumers to be informed consumers, they are on the down slide. Also not being given specific reasons but just ""thoughts and apologies"" just adds insult to jnjury."
"I have complained that lately the application does not add the weekly exercises correctly (it only takes the first exercise of the day and it then ignores the rest of the exercises). I had a reply from Samsung instructing me to clear the cadh  ... which I did and restarted my phone  ... the problem persist.  Please note that I have also just updated the application, the problem is still there.  Please fix this trivial bug, it's impacting my ability to Guage my weekly progress in a quick mann"
"I enjoy this app but find it lacking things. I sit at a desk all day, but each evening I workout. It cannot accurately calculate the weight/reps and calories burned during my excersice. And unless I remember to have it track each thing I'm doing, it doesn't recognize my workout. I appreciate that it realized I was doing cardio, but I really wish there was a manual way to enter the resistance and speed I was using, because you cannot accurately calculate calories burned without that information."
The app used to keep track of your total steps since starting to use the app. That drop down menu does not exist anymore. Very disappointing. I'm going to install a different app. Great job on losing a customer.
"The app doesn't even work. When you sign in, you get a spinner that never stops spinning. Forcing stop and reinstalling the software doesn't make any difference. Luckily I'm still within the return period for my watch."
"Sleep tracking has been showing the overall time, but not the amount per sleep state. Also, please turn the background on the sleep tracker back dark. I don't like the white background and can't figure out how to change it."
"Worst app, I am not able to sync it with my galaxy watch. Now, if I am not able to sync data with mobile, what is the benefit of watch and app. Please help to resolve the issue. I have tried resetting both the device but still not working"
"Heeelp, wont sync to virgin pulse. Ive checked all permissions, updated to the latest version. Disconnected reconnected but nope. Im going to have to go back to google fit and that doesnt work on my samsung watch. This means i will have to excercise with my phone. Very frustrating."
"I just noticed that this app when synced with Galaxy Fit device, calculates my active time by taking into account both my mobile phone and smart band. So basically I look like I had walked twice more minutes while my steps are not calculated twice which is correct at least."
"Why did you include watch and phone in total steps? I want my steps only from my watch. I find having both makes it inaccurate. Please put this feature back. It used to be that way. I could select phone only, watch only, or both. The feature wasn't broke and worked fine so why change it? Doesn't make sense"
"Life dangerous. I had an old samsung in my room. I was having a heart attack. Had to immediately know my heart rate , i remembered my samsung had this app and i remembered it could do that. Friends found the phone , opened S health. It refused to open unless it had internet connection. After setting up the wifi connection the app finally opened but refused to continue unless we set up a two step verification. It kept us busy and lost precious time. I could be dead."
"After the recent update of samsung health app, the widget display on the homescreen is not working.  Widget is useful for displaying the number of steps without launching the app. It also had diffiuculty syncing with healthy365 app. Please help to take a look at it."
Love using this app with the monthly challenges every month very motivating. One downside is the obvious cheating that can be done as some competitors complete a challenge in 3days ... don't think so. Please fix this Samsung for those of us that genuinely use the app.
"Latest update stopped syncing my steps with Virgin Pulse app. I used Samsung health app with my Samsung watch to send my step data. I needed my steps to track for my Hospital's wellness plan. Please fix Update: Samsung has fixed this issue! Our steps are now working again. The active minutes are not crossing over, but the steps are working. I hope the active minutes will also be fixed! Thank you"
I have been using the app for well over a year and today the step count has stopped working. In spite of contacting live chat and momentarily getting a resolution it has continued to malfunction. The solution looks like a new phone. Very annoying. Same issue today 13th December. Pissed off
"Loved the app, help me lose 60lbs with the weight management. Then to see the removed the weight management the best part of the app. Made the app completely useless. Its just a step counter now & maybe track your water. It was perfect before."
"It's not very accurate at all for my sleeping or my steps, I have cleared my cache and restart the phone. I returned my fitbit versa 3 for the active 2 and its starting to disappoint me. The auto picked up I was cycling when I was actually walking and didn't even add my steps. Sleeping wise it's recording going to sleep semi accurate but waking up is so off."
The app was useful until the weight management feature was removed. The whole point of the app is to help you manage you activity and food intake and they removed half with the latest update. Doesn't make any sense to remove that feature. I want that back!!!!!
After the update the voice coaching doesn't work anymore and I have tried reinstalling and checked all the settings for the notifications and it still doesn't work ...it is effecting ally tuna and I don't plan to continue using this app if it is not fixed ! Fix it asap
"Been using the app since January 2019, very happy. But since yesterday my Strava data do not want to sync into the app, I'm not sure if this is a Samsung Health App issue or a Strava issue. Reinstalled everything, reconnected everything like before, but with no success. Any pointers ?"
"The App is good in many ways...I have been using many versions of it on my earlier phones.. But on my Samsung M30 it is not working properly. It stops recording the steps suddenly, without any reason. I tried reinstalling it but the problem persists."
"Error. Cannot open the app. After the latest update, the app forced me to allow phone calls permission in my setting, why a health program needs that is beyond me. Couldn't deny it, so I just have to allow it. Then problem comes with and the program crashed each time with an error code 0x2a#0. Hope Samsung fix this. I am currently in quarantine now, I am relying on the SpO2 monitor to check my O2 level. Wished I didn't perform the update."
"I have been using this for several years. Tracking for walks always shows weak gps signal since upgrade to Note 10. The further I upgrade phone the less functionality I get. No more oxygen sensor, sleep monitoring etc. Phone features are getting hobbled so Samsung can sell some watches? I'm getting really fed up with Samsung products and looking to switching to Garmin fenix watch which does it all. Don't bother referring me to Samsung, I'm not paid to waste my time as consultant for Samsung."
"I'm still having issues with the step count. I have tried pausing, restarting and reinstalling and it still doesn't work properly. 4 5 mile run and only 2000 steps....should be more like 10,000! Hasn't auto recognised any activities for about 3 weeks. Will likely uninstall."
It was time to get more active and challenge myself to walk more! I just completed my very first monthly challenge after failing half way from the previous one. I feel so happy and strong that I was able to complete a monthly challenge!
It turns on/off randomly. I have to run Map My Ride along with it. Idk why it pauses when I have settings turned off for pausing. I am learning to really hate this app....I cannot correct the information or ADD a workout to make corrections. ****So very FRUSTRATED ****
"Recently got back into SHealth when I upgraded my phone from a j7 to a s21. The app is pretty straightforward until adding friends, now this may be because most of the people I've tried to add are on IOS, but I always had to find some roundabout way to add them. Speaking of IOS, the reason I have this at 4 stars is not this version of the app, but the IOS version. Update the Apple version of this app to allow friend challenges. That's the main reason I recommended they get SHealth."
"Was using this app regularly. Then it updated and wanted to have access to phone and contacts, as well as link to a Samsung Account otherwise it would not open. Why? This should be my choice and if it is trying to force you to link to contacts, then I wouldn't trust it. Plus the phone number it linked the account to was wrong. Its a health app and mainly used it just for checking steps. Now uninstalled and will use another app."
"Monitor perpetually tells you to adjust and doesnt give a reading. Essentially, for the ""added benefit"" of being unable to get a read on anything at all, you give up all sort of extra info to Samsung. Stick to runkeeper or some other tracker for walking and workouts."
"Updates are supposed to fix problems but in the last update, the sleep tracking function is one hour off in recording the time it detected you falling asleep and when you woke up. I sent an email to the development team but never heard back."
"Data permissions- I have changed it to allow all and I still can't get it to sync with my other apps. Very disappointing, my friend and I use this app to keep each other motivated and it won't sync with other apps."
"Every fitness/health tracker offers a calculation of steps taken. For those of us who are disabled and cannot walk, but can benefit from many other tracking like sleep, step tracking isn't required. Your app allows customization with the exception of removing steps. Please make this an option to custom remove. Insisting it must be a default non removable customization is a bit insensitive to those of us without the use of feet."
"I was very happy with this app when it had the weight management option. I lost 90 lbs over 7 months using that feature. Now that it is gone this app to me is not near what it could be. If you would add it back, I would give you a 5 star rating"
"Going backwards as per each update! UX is weak. Starting counting steps is not simple. It should be done with just one or two taps from the widget. Besides, in the latest update you can only 'Resume' your steps, and not from 0."
"While other pieces are good, the global challenge is broken. I started the April challenge only to find that by lunch today (the first day of the challenge) the first place was occupied by someone whose device claimed over 80 miles walked. No fun challenging cheaters. The rest of the app isn't bad, needs to work with other apps to be better."
"I just started exploring the app and found that breathing exercise is limited to 10 seconds for inhale or exhale. This needs to be longer, and go up to 20. I still use it for tracking but have to divide the cue intervals in my head."
"I would give this app more stars, but I am currently trying to use it to count calories and they have just taken that widget off of the phone and watch. Please bring it back as I found it to be VERY useful in my weight-loss journey."
"Location issues, app doesn't keep location. After detection soon after Location is lost and tracking stops being effective. Real frustrating when you're looking to record routes and build a routine. This needs to be fixed or I'll have to switch to Strava."
"This is a very useful App. I have used it for many years however I do think that the developers could improve the weekly comparative table. There are no age clusters so a 73 year old male. gets compared against all other male users regardless as to their age. It would be more useful if there was an additional, age related comparison provided."
"I like the app to track fitness, most recently walking. I enjoy the 200k goal a month. I have put 4 stars because I dislike the user experience, I don't want to know I'm rank 442,456 globally (why would I?!). I'd prefer to know how many steps to go to next star to make it more personal. Also would like to know when stars dissappear. Lastly, having reached 200,000 steps (yay!) the message displayed is ""Let's go for #1 now"" which is a bit sad because for me the user, that isn't a realistic goal!"
What happened to this app? It used to be at least 4 stars on my list but now the algorithm that calculates average speed during the run is totally messed up and is off by one to two min/mile. Please update and fix this problem. Thanks.
"Using with my gear active watch (released 3/8/2029). Samsung Active watch steps does not sync to samsung health separately. it seems like it is counted in all steps, when there is a option for me to select gear wear.. it syncs all other activity,like heartrate, but not my steps?. 1 star until you fix it. it is messing up my step counts that I have connected to with virgin pulse for points I receive. I should not have to carry my phone everywhere to get steps. not cool."
"App is good but the problem is, it keeps crashing and instead of saving the data and going to the next level, it goes back to the beginning and you have restart. Hopefully they will fix it with the next update"
What happened to the design? I loved the old layout look better. More simple. Also I feel like there should be a history to look back on your prior readings. S ok me times I do multipul a day. I would like to be able to see them all.
"I love it! There are these cute challenges each month you can participate in and little challenges you can do with friends. It tracks your steps, how long you sleep, how much calaries, fats, and protien you eat each day. Its just a really cool app, I love it so much and use it daily. I'm currently doing Februarys challenge which is spa themed, Im fixing to get the first star."
"This app needs so much work. Take tips from Fitbit or MapMyRun or any other health app. Have a daily dashboard to easily see steps, distance, calories burned, all in one screen without scrolling. That way we can scroll to yesterday or other day. Create a weekly dashboard/summary of steps, minutes active, distance traveled, average calorie burn, average HR. The app is pretty much useless to me and I upload all my workout data into another app."
"I updated the app and it notified me that the privacy policy has changed. It prompted me to set up a 2 step verification process and when i input my number I'm not getting any verification code despite trying several times, and i cant access my account without going through that 2 step verification process set up."
"Been using this app to help me lose weight. Suddenly I go to check how many calories I can eat based on my activity level so far today and the function is gone. No where to be found. It shows me how much I've said I've eaten through my fitness pal, but not how much I should have eaten based on my activity level so far in the day. Very disappointed as MFP doesn't track as well."
Overall actually pretty good. But finding historical workout information was ludicrously hard (hidden). No link from the 'recent workout' page and no table view. Has this changed in a recent version? I don't remember this data being so hard to find.
"I really miss the old version with management weight loss and day activity count, it was usefull and helped me lose weight. I hope it will come back with next version update or just to have the posibility to keep the old version."
"I was super happy with this app. I have to keep track of all my vitals due to poor health. It was so easy for my GP to see my overall figures each month, but now i have a new phone, the app wont let me manage my stress or heart rate anymore?? Ive tried doing an update and nothing changes, so really disappointed in it now. ‚òπ"
"Why did you make this update? The lay out is not efficient, I don't see an option to see fat totals only a daily percentage. Is there any way to uninstall the update? A silly simplified imput screen and no way to see each meal layed out with each snack you have. Why? This used to be the best app to track nutrition and fitness. I specifically bought a Samsung watch to use this app."
"Been using this app for at least 3 years to count my steps. But lately it's been missing so many of my steps. I didn't have this problem for the last 3 years but now it's missing a lot of my steps which may be minor to some but I count my steps as part of a challenge at work and have to use other methods of step counting because this app now misses so many steps. Stop with the updates, it's perfectly fine smh! I also use this app to calorie for intake, blood pressure and weight. It's a good app."
"Was a good app. It used to measure pulse and O2 saturation, but now it isn't an option. I wasn't expecting super accurate results more of a ball park figure. I am guessing they want to just people to buy the watches.."
"Do not waste your time. Samsung deleted the Weight Management Widget! Why would Samsung remove the one feature that made this app superior to all other apps? Basically this app has been watered down to a weight watchers app, boring. The other features are bland and predictable. I am now in search of another weight management app and all of my prior data is gone. Do not bother downloading this app, it sucks without the weight management widget."
"I really like this app and how it syncs easily with my Samsung Galaxy Watch, which I find much better than Fitbit. I would like it more if it could sync with the My Fitness Pal app. Their food database is more robust for journaling what you eat."
"I use this app every day and it's great. Until I want to manually enter a work out. When I put everything in for my work out, time started, duration, and miles for even walking I hit save and it won't let me. Why can't I enter a work out manually? It really messes up my tracking."
Great program paired with a galaxy active wear watch! Tracks everything in one place! My only question is why samsung did not add a blood pressure checker to the app. It's hard to record blood pressure when the app doesn't do it which would be greatly convenient.
"Every update fixes less issues then it introduces. Wonder if there is any kind of quality assurance or customer feedback noted. There are countless reviews saying ""Removal of weight management has made the app useless"". However the developers neither provide a reason nor an assurance for it to be back. Forget getting customers an integrated environment with smartwatches if you can't give features they use these things for :("
"Using OnePlus 6, the Samsung Health app will not log me in, the screen is just constantly loading. Folks on the internet are installing older versions of the app that allowed to skip this step but this is not a pleasant solution... I tried pretty much everything: reinstalling, clearing data and cache but nothing works. Are you working on patching this or should I just return the Galaxy Watch 3? Would be a bummer..."
"I like this app very much. Only one thing should be fixed. Manual sleep data. It only allows us to record once per day. As for me, I sleep twice a day to manage my schedule. So I'm not able to record my second sleeping"
This was a great app and I purchased a Galaxy watch on the back of with steps linking into Myfitnesspal. Unfortunately since the last update it doesn't track steps back into Myfitnesspal. It stops at 26 steps. There is some sync activity going on and food and manually recorded exercise in MFP shows in S-health. I tried reinstalling both apps but that didn't work so rolled back S-health and after a couple of days steps started showing up in MFP. Updated SH today and issue returned
"I cannot get this app to open on my phone... After I sign in, it takes me to a screen that keeps spinning and spinning but never loads... Super frustrating, as I just purchased my watch yesterday and would like to have a dashboard to see my health stats etc and steps."
"Uninstalled...really, really liked this app but now looks like it's turned into spyware with the latest update policy, which appears to give no option for us to decide what information is taken and by whom and no option to use the app without giving it new permissions which for me are unacceptable seeing as the app worked absolutely fine before without needing them. Disappointed in Samsung."
Latest update changed the integration with Samsung Health. It no longer shows weekly step data or weekly heart data on the Active 2. Sleep score is new and lame. The older sleep efficiency percentage was better. I have this watch to NOT have to use my phone. The latest update took useful features away from the Active 2. UPDATE: 4/15/2021 Samsung give me specifics on the reason you need my contact info and access to make phone calls. Until then üñï
"I don't use this as often as I'd like because it requires network, and I spend lots of time in areas where that's not possible. The recent update requires an account, which I don't have, if you sign in with Google it wants my age, DOB, and lots of other data I don't want to share. It's a heart rate monitor and pedometer, why's it need all this info? It's too bad, I barely used it after it required constant network, now I don't use it at all."
"I'm using Galaxy watch active 2. The application is working quite good but the heart rate monitor cannot be used to monitor the heart rate continuously and get the data every minute in a period of time. It is very important for accessing the data of someone's heart rate in every minute to be used as a research data. If you have a solution of the problem, let me know.."
"Liked the original version. New update wants access to my contacts, phone. Why? I won't allow access so I can't use the new version! And don't say it's for my optimal experience! An optimal experience would be for me to not allow access. Does anyone know of another app to use other than this one?!"
"I used to like this app on my other Galaxy phone where I was able to use my phone to monitor my HR, stress level and O2 levels manually. This feature seems to have been dropped with my new Galaxy Note. Bummer as that's why I used the app the most. Now it needs all sorts of permissions to ""run properly "". It's unfortunate what it's downgraded itself to. Apple products never looked so good as they do now..."
"It used tp be a good app that can track my steps very well. However, Since late Nov,it no longer counts my steps. No matter how much I walk,it is just not counting. My tracker watch can count. This app just shows 0 step taken. Can the technical team please look into the matter. Thank You."
lacks a wide variety of foods for tracking but this rest is fine. 3 stars since that was my priority and this sure doesn't best the competition. The watch integration is smooth and so is the UI but it's not that simple and representation of data.
"For some reason it keeps disconnecting with my rewards app. This is very frustrating since my steps/ running isn't always moving over. Plus, this app keeps saying that it can not locate a server, when I'm already connected to a server."
Ever since the update last year I can't get past two step verification. I get the code put it in and nothing happens. I uninstalled the app n downloaded it again and still nothing. I was told to contact support. I can't get past the two step verification to contact anyone. I cleared the cache already n nothing changed.
"Missing Reminders. Not sure, but I dont have the ability to set a reminder to move each hour and there is no option to add a drink water reminder. With the new Galaxy Active watch was hoping to get these notifications."
"The new update made this a horrible app! I have used S Health for at least 4 years and it's been awesome for tracking purposes. The newest version is horrible...to fix it, please, please, please go back to the last version and stop trying to improve it, you're making it worse and less efficient...essentially, going backwards"
"Used to be good. Now the app and the active 2 watch won't show the map of my activity such as running and all . Did samsung remove the function? When I'm running the gps icon is flashing and show its working but there is no map after running or syncing to the phone.I find that samsung love to do this , after getting us to buy their devices and then remove the function down the road ."
App is completely useless. Crashing when trying to sync with my galaxy watch. Tried clearing cache but that didn't work. Everything works fine if I turn Bluetooth off disconnecting my watch. Step data also not syncing to any connected third party. Useless and so annoying.
"Ever since i got new Samsung S21 I can't use the app, due to a stupid notice about agree to terms you need to change in settimgs. Where? You have access to everything on my phone and still can't use the app! ü§¨ I did give permission when directed after hitting agree, but it just kept repeating message and directly taking me to settings where everything is on for you to have access!!"
"I updated the app and now it goes round in circles asking for permission to do...what I have no idea. I don't want to give it access to my contacts or phone. It's a good app, but will remove it if I can't use it without giving access to my contacts or phone. I have uninstalled the app. The assertion that they won't use the phone info indicates access to the phone shouldn't be a prerequisite."
"It's ok but it needs to lose the all steps hell it will count 2 different trackers possibly more if you can sync them , it counted my Samsung steps and MFP steps both until I figured out how to only count 1 tracker I'm pretty sure that's how so many people have a million steps within a week on the global challenges. Maybe it just me but if you do the math it ain't adding up"
"Haven't been able to use the app since the last update. It tells me to set up 2 step verification. I click ok and the app resets. My phone number is already linked and i never recieved a verification code. I re entered my phone number and still never recieved a verification number. In fact, after i hit verify, the app doesn't even open an input page. It just resets to the beginning of the verification process. I used this app frequently and am currently very dissatisfied"
"After months of being on the fence about updating and using the app I finally decide to this morning. The permissions are questionable at best but I figured if I don't like it again I'll just stop the app. I wanted to use it to read my heart rate. It. Does. Not. Work. At. All. Latest update, expensive phone, literate user, but nothing. What gives, what the actual???"
4 years later and they still havent fixed the breathing app. On 3 different phones over the years it still does the same thing. you click start breath excersize and the cycles go so fast you cant even count them. worthless feature. either fix or remove it
I love this app but only one thing is missing is weight management function is suddenly gone after I updated latest version. And my galaxy watch still notify me that I need to burn my calories which I can't modify my goal. but also eventhough I have reached my weight goal it shows me to have more activity calories that is also belongs to the weight management function which was only there for few weeks. I set -0.75kg per week at the moment and nowhere can adjust it now.
"I've used this on and off for several years to track all sorts of things, and usually been pretty happy with it. I am now encountering an issue where searching for foods causes a crash out to main menu."
Was using it for quite awhile. Then it asked me to confirm acceptance of new privacy agreement and the link provided did not allow me to read the agreement. Eventually tracked it down through the internet. The language seemed to imply they could release my information to insurance companies. So I switched to a different app.
"Best app I've tried for weightloss. Running total of calories burned vs ingested has been by far more accurate. Also love the step challenges. Some healthy competition goes a long way. Very supportive community forum. There are a few trolls/cheaters, but mostly people just cheer you on and the cheaters are really only cheating themselves. Miss the barcode function on myfitnesspal, but worth it for the better accuracy."
I like this app. It is easy to use and connects to most other health apps like MyFitness Pal and my Withings scale through the HealthMate app. It works with my Samsung Active 2 watch as well. The dashboard shows the most important things I track and there is a competition type steps motivator under the together link at bottom. I like this app because it provides easy trackable information.
Great app except for the relentless cheats on the global challenges. It's a shame and completely spoils it as there's no real point in trying to get into top few % or trying to win. If this could be resolved then 5 stars.
They took away the one feature that helped me to my eating disorder!! I only got this watch because it had this feature and now I'm considering getting a new watch because of it. The weight management tab is gone. And it hasn't come back. Im done.
"The app requires the phone permission to get past the first screen (after an update). I don't need this app to handle phone calls. If there's a use case where it would need them, it should ask at that time, not prevent the app from starting in the first place. Permission overreach is a real problem in this app ecosystem, and it's shameful for as prominent a company as Samsung to be doing it. EDIT after developer response: I don't want to use that feature. I don't need that feature. There's no justification for this preemptive and excessive permission requirement to start the app. I frankly don't trust a developer to ever have an unneeded permission, even if I can go into settings and revoke the permission later, so I won't be using this app any longer."
"Everything was pretty ok till this update. My sleep tracker is bugging with recording time, can't insert it manually, can't record it from my Fit 2, can't press OK on app's predicted sleeping time... I mean what's going on with the things that worked just normally, whay do you have to ruin it with every update?"
"I need help changing the recomended nutrients values. They are locked in at values but my doctor wants different values and either its not possible orits not very easy to access. I still think the water unit should be adjustable I dont have a cup that messures 8.4 oz. i have a 8 oz cup, a 10 oz cup, a 12 oz cup. Water bottles normally come in 16.9 oz."
"The best app for your healthy treatment, activity tracking and food tracking, but they are trying to destroy it! Do not update above version 6.10 otherwise you will not have the possibility to use the weight management and caffeine track. Which is the best part of the app for me. #Samsung please return the ""Weight managment"" I guess you removed it because of some stupid politically correct regulations, but pleaseee the function is working pretty good."
"4/8/21: Was using this daily until the latest update. Now it wants to make phone calls?! No thank you, and it won't run if you deny it that permission. If the next update doesn't remove that requirement, I'm uninstalling. UPDATE 8/9/21: You can deny Contacts permission, allow Phone, and then the app will install. Then you can deny Phone and the app will still run. Will update again if this behavior changes."
I keep getting a pop up telling me this can't run on a rooted phone. my phone is not rooted! UPDATE (may 4th): I cleared the cache and data storage from the app. I haven't had a pop up since. (I never used the app at all before)
Alright so last September I left a review noting the removal of the weight management app and how this is super inconvenient and annoying. This most recent update also removed looking at average calorie burns over months so you cant even calculate this yourself anymore. App is now essentially useless for calorie intake and burn tracking for anything more than the single day snapshot/weight loss tracking. I do not recommend at all and am utterly confused by the development decisions.
"The app now requires 2FA however, it won't allow me to verify the text code it sends me, so I can no longer access the app. Very frustrating. Can't give more than 1 star if they release an unusable app. Update: Samsung responds with some cookie cutter bs answer. Obviously it should work, the problem is that it doesn't. Be better."
"I didn't need damn Samsung account before the update, now using the app without account and without enabling two factor is not even possible. There goes three years of training/riding sessions in my samsung health app. Thanks Samsung. Luckily I was able to downgrade to the previous version so at least I can use the app. Avoid the latest version."
"Recent updates have caused app to glitch with step tracking. It's kind of annoying since I am linked to another app that needs this accuracy, and I also need the accuracy for my fitness lifestyle , currently making activity adjustments to help me reach a certain weight loss goal."
"Love the app, has alot of info on your daily exercises that you do, but man come on and get rid of the ads or ""related content"" or whatever they are that are on the top/bottom portions of the app. It just makes it look clutter and not first rate. Get rid of them and then ill 5 star it."
"I like the app because of its connectivity to other apps. However, The step counting feature is flawed and does not accurately count steps. The heart rate sensor is inconsistent as well."
"I strongly believe that who developed the interface hates humanity. It took me 3 attempts to associate a Samsung account. I had to reset my password twice because of limitations on this app. I use a password manager with strong password but had to dumb it down for this stupid interface to get it. It didn't allow me to paste the complex password from the clipboard, so I had to manually type a long password with tons of special characters multiple times. The UI designer needs to pet a cat..."
I like how you can track your fitness progress and meals so you dont have to use more than 1 app. I wish you could scan food packages like my fitness pal to more easily add snacks or meals. Hello I just switch to a different phone moto and now the app will not open any suggestions
"I was using this app regularly, but since day before yesterday its not opening and a warning type text appearing ""unable to open app . . . Your device has been compromised . . . Bla bla bla"" neither I did any update on phone or in app . . . Phone compromised automatically, really? Then why i am using a phone which can operate itself . . . Both Samsung phones and apps think they are dictators"
"App is OK. ""women's health"" is a joke. Samsung, any female developers and testers on this team? This is one area where the fitbit app is way better. Aug 2021 update Ugh, app keeps getting worse, now forcing me to allow app access to phone to even open the app, and there's no option to opt out. And now completely locked out due to unknown error because I was forced to log in after accepting phone permission and had to reset my password because I couldn't remember what I had used 2 years ago."
"The only thing that's wrong, although its a biggie, is that the stress calculator is dead wrong. Every single time. It thinks I'm stressed morning, noon and night. Its absolutely crazy. I write on the note taker every single day ""not stressed"". Either make it actually work correctly or just take it off."
"The app was ok. I gave it a 3.5 because I like the sleep monitoring, the activity tracker, and keeping track of my water intake in 1 app. The app is too invasive with accesses to in order to allow use of devices. I have always worked around what I wanted out of these devices vs how much privacy I wanted. But this last update will not allow me to work around the device having access to my phone and contacts. I deleted the app. This has to improve or its no better than Apple. So I changed my rate"
"The step tracker has completely stopped working. My Samsung watch keeps my steps, but the app never shows it. I've uninstalled and reinstalled and it still won't work. I will give a better rating once this is fixed."
"The latest update is rubbish, app will no longer open. Also I see little point in having 2FA authentication, please get this corrected. I purchased a Samsung watch for two reasons, contactless payments but Samsung pay isn't supported by my bank and the other reason was the health app. Thanks to the update for turning my smart watch into a normal watch. A company of this size should have tested this before deployment. Very disappointing. Samsung get it sorted ffs."
"It was a great app, especially the weight management feature. Unfortunately, in the last version it was omitted, I don't know why. During using it for three months, I could lose 15 lbs which was great. I hope it comes back soon."
"For some reason the app hardly ever records resting heart rate. That was one of the things that are important to me. Fitbit sucked for everything else, it was bulky, most of the additional things didn't work well, but RHR always did. I would have kept the Fitbit just for RHR if I knew that this app wasn't going to measure it."
Since I wrote this review it has started working. Not sure what fixed it but it works now. Thanks :) Update: I don't know what update I had but for some reason my watch will show me my sleep stages and score and keep track of it but when I go into the app it says nothing like it didn't keep track. Very frustrating.
Shame you killed the app. I used the connected services. Without them the app is no longer accurate. Which makes it useless for fitness and health tracking. I will be uninstalling and wiping my data when the new fitbit charge 3 lands.
"Pretty good overall health tracking. Occasionally has problems with syncing information from my watch to the app which can be frustrating. I like having access to the basic ""Calm"" meditation program for free!"
I like it in principle as it comes with my phone. It's a little annoying the monthly steps challenge points dont convert into anything or so I can tell. Plus after buying a compatible Samsung wearable late Feb 2020 its already broken so the app doesn't work properly with my phone...
"I just learned this app had a pulse oximeter to measure blood oxygen levels. This is a feature I use many times per day because it is more convenient than wearing the pulse ox on my fingertip and having it fall off. I'm on high amounts of oxygen and always have my cell phone on me when I walk around the house so it's very easy. My phone died so I bought a new phone, downloaded the same exact app, and I can no longer measure my blood oxygen levels through the Samsung app. Highly disappointed!"
"Why won't the watch and phone talk with one another? If i start running with my phone, my watch has no idea. Same the other way around. Yet when i finish running, they'll happily share data. Only my phone connects to my ear phones, so i hear nothing when controlling it with my watch, but my watch is easier to control. Very disappointed."
"Horrible since updates. This app used to be so amazingly helpful. The biggest issue for me is the sleep tracking doesn't work. I've called twice with no resolution. Even when I leave my tracker on my side table, it says I was 100% restless. Useless! And now no HR monitor, Sp02 the step count is iffy. Can't you at least fix something?"
The app recently started randomly calculating my info and nutrition as if I were male despite my profile still saying female. It does this randomly and only some times does it switch back if I mess with the sex setting. This is really irritating given I track my calories burned and my daily calorie recommendation. Unreliable.
"Says access denied when I try to open the app. I have tried everything with Samsung support team and it still doesn't work. I bought a Samsung phone (s9) and watch (galaxy watch 3) so I didn't have to worry about things like this it's pretty terrible that I can't even open Samsung health... In reply to below: yes I have tried clearing the cache, the cache partition, reinstalling and many other things. You leave a number to call but it is a US number so I can't call it! How to contact from UK?"
"I have enjoyed using Samsung Health for many years and whilst the app is still great I have been disappointed and annoyed by the latest update including commas in their numbering. Commas are for writing, not maths (unless you're an accountant). A small gripe, but one that gets under my skin everytime I open the app!"
"Used to be good. However I would like to track progress (I.e weight) over the course of a month and not every day. Please add the option to view weight variations over a month and not a day , just like the old version please. Now jts hard to see the general trend"
"At least give us the possibility to roll back to the previous version before the unfortunate update! All my progress is lost and the app lost many useful and fun features. And please don't tell me to call the number to solve the problems, that is NOT a solution!"
"Since the update the app no longer tells me my total calories burned for the day. Kinda pointless to have my watch now when one of the main reasons I got it was to track my exercise and daily calorie burn. Really annoyed that they would get rid of this. Debating going back to Fitbit now, as much as I dislike them too."
"I think it's an excellent app for free, it's ideal for your overall health especially allowing you to fill in the food ingredients and measures from the food packet,therefore really indicating food dangers and portions allowing you to gain top health and learn the importance of healthy eating ,perhaps making this app award winning, it interacts with a community, I enjoy the challenges, really great thinking Samsung!"
Terrible syncing! This has made my Galaxy Fit device useless because I loose my daily fitness data every day. It just can't seem to sync properly with my device. I even raised a complaint (with screenshots attached) but their customer care guys can't to be seem bothered to respond. And now I've wasted my money on their stupid Fit watch. Huge waste!
"Please bring back Weight Management. I woke up this morning and it's gone with the latest bug fix. How was that a bug? Update, I called the number and all they do is log complaints. It was removed intentionally. Don't get the watch if you want to track calories burned vs consumed cause it doesn't do that anymore. Update 12/2020 upgraded phone cause I'm an idiot and now step count goes all night. Hurray, I'm logging 13000 plus steps. POS!"
"Started using the Samsung Health app committedly in May 2020. Used it to set my weight loss targets and it's been an awesome experience. Helps me stay on track with my calorie intake and burn. I like the ease of adjusting the weight management targets - for those days I want to eat a little more or indulge! The weekly reviews, I always look forward to. Loved the app so much I got the Galaxy Watch Active! The monthly challenge is fun and sweetly named. Love the ""get active"" reminders too!üëç"
"I recently bought a Samsung not 10+.I already have a Samsung Gear 3 Classic smart watch, but why can't it connect with this app. This phone and watch wasn't cheap. I bought the phone bc it was bigger and I could see things on it better. Gaming was better on note 10+ than on my Note 8. Please, explains why can't I download my SW Gear 3 Classic to my phone. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. I have been Samsung phone and products fan for over 20 years. I may be changing to IOS soon."
love the monthly challenges. I also like that I can set my daily goals..it makes me motivated...I always try to improve my averages. I have never been a competitve athletic individual...this app gives me the opportunity to compare my achievements with others ..AROUND the WORLD!
"The make and manage phone calls mandatory permission. Don't make it required. Doesn't make it a better experience if it isn't noticeable. Your automated response was clearly too faulty to not address my issue, that it is mandatory."
"I am using a new galaxy watch active. I have not found an option for manual setting frequency when I run, for example. there is no way to add one more training exercise like canoeing. looking forward to get help or address this issue to developers"
I have been using this app from last 3 months and I was really loving it but now all of a sudden it's showing some mismanagement in calculating my distance. It shows less distance than I actually covered and this left me disappointed. Please check out this problem..
"Running coach doesn't work with the 4mm Galaxy Watch 4 Classic paired to my Galaxy Note 10. Running Coach Exercises cancel at random if they were started from the Watch, but if they're started from the phone then the only metric I see on my Watch is heart rate and the pause button on that screen doesn't pause either my music or workout. It has also never been good at measuirng speed during running coach. Trying to get this to work seriously hindered my run. Shoulda got a Garmin."
"This app erased all of my data that I had stored for my summer goals; distance, speed, day of the week: everything totally worthless. I truly regret preordering the Note 10 so that I can go into the apple system. They might not have as many features however the apps that they do have work! Wasted workouts!"
"It's actually pretty darn good. Is a general app, covers several areas. I use it often to confirm sleep, mtn biking, & hikes. I don't generally recommend the auto-pause feature, due to rock-gardens, etc, but it likely works for others. For a more accurate heart rate, use a timer & measure it yourself"
"This app stopped working when I didn't agree to give permission to access my contacts, camera and files. It was awesome before. Had to get a different one, and uninstalled this one. U guys are losing people because of this stupid üôÑpermissions that are not necessary."
"Worse and worse Agreed, each time they do it they make it worse - The last update now means that while it's kind enough to count steps it won't keep them in history. It's also perpetually running ads about monitoring my menstrual cycle which as 55 year old man I do not require since I am decidedly post menopausal. It's also no longer possible to sync it with the Qantas app. Use Google fit, it's better."
"Used to be a good app but lately it just will not sync with my Samsung band. It will not register my sleep, my steps, my exercise. Get it sorted! Uninstall app and reinstalled seemed to fix the problem. I have a question. Is it possible to change to distance from miles to kilometres?"
"It's Ok, but there's a ways to go. I have it on my Samsung Galaxy Watch Active as well. I did 10 minutes on the stairmaster and it says I walked up 1 flight of stairs. Hopefully the kinks can be worked out with the feedback offered by customers."
"Would be a 5 star app if you fix the weight management card. I understand you want to include cals burned at rest but your app is extremely triggering to those who have experienced eating disorders when you wake up to a card that says you're already over in calories when you havent eaten a bite yet. it's not user friendly, as it will say you are over until the end of the day when It resets. You cant check actual progress to see if you're on track until midnight when the days over. please fix."
suddenly stoped and sead my security has changed and I can no longer get into the app. So frustrating as it was helping me please fix or tell me who to contact. would add pic of messages but won't let me. But when it was good this app was great.
Samsung please sort your app out. My Android 9 phone is CONSTANTLY popping up saying Samsung Health is a battery draining app. I keep force closing your app but it keeps reopening and then I get notified it is draining the battery again and again every few minutes . No other app does this just yours. Please fix it. Thanks
"One big thing it is missing is following friends in other activities like running, cycling etc. Also the ability to set other challenges then walking. It would also be good to be able to set up your own training plan."
This app is simply great... The interface is very user friendly. The achievements and badges feature is really icing on the cake as it helps me to keep pushing myself for those extra steps. Highly recommended.
"I don't like that I can't add more than 3 workouts, If the workout is listed on the app I should be able to add to the watch! Not helpful!! I can't get an accurate workout because I'm constantly substituting similar workouts -IT'S A PAIN! Update: I don't want to call you, I would like for you to make the workouts listed on the phone app, available to add to the watch! Aerobic exercises is one example it's not available on the watch!"
"The Samsung health app on the Galaxy watch refuses to update no matter what I Try. I tempting to updated results in the Galaxy store on the phone saying that I could not install the update only watch and that I need to reconnect my watch to the Phone. Also, for some reason this also call this my watch to both disconnect and unpair from my phone, Leading me to have to go through the pairing process again. Also the Heart shaped Activity ring on the Galaxy watch Will not track workout minutes."
Was excited to use this app and it worked great for the first year. I've had this phone since 12/2019 and since 4months ago it started to act up doubling or tripling my steps or not recording any at all when the day changes I restarted my phone cleared the cache of the app but nothing. Tonight I did all of that even restarted my phone 2x still not recording my steps. plz fix
"Can't use the app, it randomly opens itself with the following message: because of new security policy samsung health can't be open on rooted device. My device is not and never has been rooted. I've uninstalled and reinstalled twice. Still get the error. So I've had to uninstall for good."
It's a pretty good app with some cool automatic features. Had it synced with Go365 for my health insurance to track steps and workouts but the last update screwed up the ability to sync so I need to find a new app or lose all my exercise data.
"After recent update when I look back at yesterday's hike which was recorded on my watch and displayed the map of the route in the summary on the app, the map is no longer visible to review. This was always viewable. Why is it no longer viewable? its part of stats the route should be visible."
"Latest update is complete garbage. From tracking meals, nutrition information, exercise and weight history can no longer be seen. Major step backwards after using app for 2 plus years and even buying the galaxy watch to work with it I'm beyond extremely disappointed."
"Still wont sync my steps and the advice from samsung was poor, i do not have a device manager on my phone, only device maintenence. I also dont have anywhere where i can select to clear cache. I selected to force stop which did absolutely nothing at all except grey out the words 'force stop' and the app still doesnt work!"
"I hate the new update. Its so much harder to use and looks like its designed for children. Anyone actually using the app wants data, whether that's over an extended period of time or for one instance. Taking away the ability to easily see that is a clear sign they don't understand their target audience or that they don't care."
"Last update removed the basic sleep tracker, IE a clock that just told you when you stopped using your phone at night and started in the morning. I don't have a smart watch device, which is now required, so this app is now useless unless they add that function back in. Very disappointing."
This app is good but it doesn't sense whether i m walking or running. So its not accurate. When i am walking it records as runninh so whole data is wrong. Dev.team Please rectify this and update. I did all the steps you have mentioned. Paused and started counting the steps. Still shows running whike i am walking No changes
"Although I never use the together feature, the response is far better than a cut and paste reply. Ty. . . . I'm locked out, because I won't provide permission to use my phone, to make and manage phone calls. I presume that auto implies permission to the call logs also. Why? The standard bot reply from Samsung is insufficient. It basically says, Trust me? I had regularly used the health app. Now I'm locked out. Along with my smart watch."
Needs more options to add workouts. Being only able to include three tyres of exercise is bloody painful. I'm extremely active and partake in multiple sports and have to go in to manually add one type of sport/workout and remove another. It's a stupid limit on an otherwise pretty great app
Like I said in previous comment that this app will not work if you do not have a Sim card. You guys reply saying that you need it for notifications and for the friends challenge. This is really not acceptable. What about all the Samsung tablets that have no Sim. There is so many people with devices without Sims that use strictly wifi. Having a wifi connection should be the only requirement. Having a Sim card as a requirement limits it's users and to many people makes absolutely no sense.
"An update where it asks permission to make and receive phone calls, with no explanation and won't work unless I agree? Very 2010 of you, Samsung. No thanks. And please don't bother to tell me to use the app to contact you. I can't get into the app because I won't give permission. I'm contacting you this way."
"Go back to integrating with other apps please. I like the Samsung watches but no app has everything, integration is key. Adding workouts manually is confusing too. I always struggle through it. Why don't all types of workouts track your heart rate?!"
Needs a sim to operate? Sims will be a thing of the past. Learn that sooner than later #wifilife Update: you replied! Good form Samsung. Good customer support so I added another üåü. The reasoning why you need a sim card still doesn't make sense and imo isn't inline with current trends. People are dropping cellular plans and opting for wifi only is trending hard. I've been off plans for over two years and have never looked back. My health app doesn't need a sim. It's not as good as yours though.
"Installing Samsung health spp pn anothe android phone does not record correct distance & steps counting. My android phone records correctly. Any reason why. Still not recording correctly. Cache cleared, pauses & reset steps. Surely this does not need to be done daily. Very annoying."
"Worked fine for a couple of years, and then wouldn't work at all. Got stuck in a circular loop of agreeing changes to privacy policy and trying to use app. Brilliantly unclear what actions I needed to take to resolve. (For the avoidance of doubt, that's British-speak for ""your app isn't very user-friendly!!"") I'd use it again if it would let me."
"It helps and support to boost the inner confidence to do more work by simply displaying the daily working graph and comparisons within age group, friends also the sleeping records. Best thing i find here is the weekly summary. It have lot more options as per user interest."
"Great app, keeps me on track of my activity. I have always used my watch to record my exercise and it has always worked great until this week. For some reason any workout I start just stops recording now, even one minute into it. I restarted a workout 7 times today to get 30 min of walking in. Then tried to do yoga, started a work out and when I was done see that it only recorded 2 minutes of yoga workout. Why is this happening all of a sudden??? I made sure everything is up to date. PLEASE FIX"
It's very annoying that I can no longer join the community Together without adding my contacts. I do not want to sync with my contacts so I have now stopped using the app. This is a pop up window that is impossible to get rid of and which stops me from joining the community without adding my contacts. Pressing the cancel button does not help since it keeps coming back.
"I agree with the other comments regarding the updated version. I used to enjoy this app, but now I have to give Samsung not needed, ridiculous permissions to phone, contacts, and camera. Wake up and get on board Samsung! In this age of privacy concerns you are moving toward less privacy. I'll be deleting the app."
The recent update wants access to information it doesn't need. I have no problem with 2 step verification but I do not want to give across info such as my contacts. So far the update doesn't affect the info coming from me smart watch but I am close to looking for a different fitness/smart watch.
"App is getting worse!!! Lack of weight management, now i can't see average weight for week! I cant care how it looka like but what does! Combined with watch helped to track and loose weight, where other app don't work that well. I really loved it! Why dont you let people use just counting calories and show where they are on watch? I dont need this watch anymore! Ibe looking for different comapny."
"The app is great for measuring heart rate, steps, food etc. but why isn't there an option to log workouts without having to start the counter? I can't take the phone to the pool or when I'm in yoga. Why isn't there a simple option to log distance or time spent exercising."
This app was great for sure. And now this latest update requires permission to make and manage phone calls for the together portion of the app. Oh please! Find another way to do it. Prompt users each time they want together or something. This permission junk is overated. I'm out till Samsung removes that permission requirement. Bye
Let me edit my sleep! I've learned from this watch I get pretty much zero deep sleep but I would like to be able to edit my sleep when it's not accurate for when I'm awake. Used to you could edit out a whole cycle of sleep like say a nap but now it's all lumped into one and the edit option is only there to delete your entire sleep record which is useless ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èalso have wondered how accurate the step count is. Also can't look at my sleep for any other night except the previous night.
"I have used this app for years and out of nowhere there is an error message that I rooted my phone?!? I tried to send an email to request assistance but got some auto response. I see the response others are getting with a phone number. Sorry guys, don't have time to sit on hold with tech support. I really hope this is fixed soon. Very disappointing. Samsung, I am not calling you. Please provide an email contact. Please actually READ these posts if you are going to bother responding."
The sync feature is pretty bad. It does not sync with the Gear S3 like most of the times.! It just comes up with sync failure. It has synced like once in 3 days ! Is there anything wrong with this app?
Having to drop the stars because the app isn't counting my steps correctly. I had the iphone 8 before I switched to the s20 5g and since then my total steps per day has dropped. Not sure what happened there. Aside from that the app works great.
"Have been using it since my S7 till now on my Note. Not sure if it's the recent software upgrade but it crashes every time I access my running trends. It has never been totally bug free from day 1, I'm sure there are much better apps out there"
"When I owned a Samsung S10e the app worked and did what I wanted (albeit with ads). Now on a Pixel 4XL and I simply cannot login no matter how many times try different ways. Giving 3 star because it does what needs to on Samsung phones, but could improve in a number of ways then dropping a star for login in problems on other phones."
"Amazing until last update Please reverse interface to old version We want to see nutrient score and grams on main screen like before, not on separate screen Overall nutrient score isn't even available anymore. Update: macros are show as old version now, thanks team! but please bring back overall nutrition score to main screen!!!"
"Not sure if anyone else has reported this issue, but the inactive alert option is missing from this app. I reported this issue to Samsung support in Australia and they had no idea, and asked me to escalate this problem to you. I have the latest version of this app and this option is now missing. Please investigate."
"Poor compared with other health apps. It only stores data for 30 days. It doesn't rotate, being fixed in portrait mode. Graphs cannot be zoomed in to analyse the data in detail. No web portal."
Poor new design as Nov 2018. No sync from this app to Strava. Data can't be exported to GPX anymore. This is a runners' worst nightmare. All samsung galaxy watches use this app. I wouldn't recommend it to any runnner. There are better alternatives. Service support useless. USA number.
"I had a great walk for an hour and it only tracked steps; less than 500. Then I switched to walking (didn't know I had to) and it kept pausing and resuming while I was walking with an audible annoying ""paused"", ""resumed"". I was done after 15 minutes of that. So now it shows my entire workout for the day as 15 minutes which can't be modified. SMH"
"Why did you feel the need to update this app? It was perfect. I am on a fat loss diet and this app was really helping me. I now don't know exact carbs, fat and protein while was a big thing i needed to track. I really don't want to download another app as I'm very loyal to samsung but looks like i don't have much of a choice. New update now fixes the problems with old version, thanks for listening samsung"
"Used to love this app but about 2 days ago it stopped recording my steps properly. I walk regularly and would get 10,000+ steps and now the app says I only walk 1000. Worst of all, if i log a walking exercise it will say ""3000 steps"" on the exercise, but the step counter doesn't change at all. I just took a walk that the app says was 2200 steps and yet the counter didnt change by more than 50, never used to be the case. I don't know what changed."
The app has good features except with inaccuracy in tracking steps. It only uses motion to track steps.so if your phone is in the inside pocket of your jacket and not shaking it does not count any steps you take. The app should rather use GPS to track your steps.
"App just randomly stops counting steps. I've cleared the cache, force stop.. all the usual things. Uninstalling because it's a waste of space. Shouldnt have to babysit these apps with constant maintenance on my end.. oh wait... isnt that why we're supposed to update these things.. yeah..nah. bye."
Excellent app. I did write saying your personal health data must be shared to use this app. I have found this is optional. So I have reinstalled it. Bring back the oxygen saturation as a separate entity as this app would be almost perfect. Give the users what they are asking for.
Samsung need to remove the sign in option and also the 2 step verification. This is totally unnecessary for an app like this. I'm not creating another account to use this app. You should just be able to install the app and then pair it to your physical Galaxy Fit wristband. This needs changing immediately.
"This is my first experience with this app, after a brief trouble of not syncing with healthify me app the problem got sorted and now it's over.The app is overall good with so many option of logging of things and best part is walking and challenging with option 'Together ',it is very good as it keeps you motivated."
"worked great for 3.5 months. now it stops after only a few seconds. it does keep counting steps, but not time, speed, or distance. talked with customer support about this twice. 2nd time they told me I should take my $1200 phone to get fixed. guess I'll find a new app then delete this one."
"I am really loving this app. It really pushes you to be more active and to be healthy. I also recently got Womens health as well and my menstrual cycle is spot on. Its only been off by a day or 2. I was also looking at pregnancy apps, and it would be interesting to include this item onto womens health as well."
"Problems with app talking or guide sound which is very occurd sound just like drunk person slow sound, I request samsung to improve or provide old or new soft sound. No Changes From Last 6 Months From Last Complaint. Please Take Note. New Problem in Samsung Health Occuring is that there is no option present for measuring Oxygen Saturation as this option was present there before in old version, please fix this option as soon as. very disappointing update."
"Some exceptional features and some that just suck: Lots of information from every workout. Good. Easy to use functionality on the watch. Good. GUI. Good. No way of manually altering stride length. Bad. (Really important in racquet sports!) Speaking of which, no modes for any racquet sport. (How can you omit pickleball?!?! Fastest growing sport in the country.) Your calories burned calculation is a joke. It's an easy calculation. Fix it! (30 min. agility ladder drills = 200 calories?!?!)"
"I used to love this app but since the removal of the weight management feature, it has become largely useless for me. Please answer this simple question before I possibly leave this app... Are you planning on bringing the Weight Management feature back or not? Many people have asked but have not yet received a clear answer. If you are, when will it be added? Your clear answer (or lack there of) will directly affect whether I stay part of the Samsung ecosystem or not. Thank you."
best experience yet with any health app... love that it detects your movement as soon as you pick up your phone... ive had quite a few apps that u have to physically turn the app on so it counts your steps..... not this one and it gives me my weekly and daily goal notifications... i love it !!!
"Did an update and now I can't log into my account, won't allow me to do 2 Step Verification. Enter the number sent and the verification button is still greyed out. App is completely unusable now. I love how their solution was to go into the app I can't use and send a screenshot, into the app I CAN'T USE."
Issues with sleep tracking and syncing to my Samsung galaxy watch active 2 under armour edition. I got to be around 10pm and wake up around 5am each day. For my sleep 4 to 5 days of the week it will show the 10pm to around 1145pm sleep on the prior days sleep total. Which makes it alot less for my current day sleep. I then turn my watch off. Got to app settings and clear the cache and force close the app and it works fine for a day or 2 then I have repeat these steps again in a day or 2. Fix it
"Doesn't work. Since I got my Note9 this app has never worked. Go through set up but hangs when you either select ""sync"" or ""skip"". Ended up having it disabled until recently to see if it worked again. It didn't."
"I like this app but it does not support industry best fitness apps like runkeeper, Nike and few more.. I understand that fitbit is a competitor in smartwatch segment but what about runkeeper and nike.. i have been using runkeeper for years and now this s health only supports Strava which is not good as other apps which I mentioned above. Please bring back support to runkeeper and other app supports."
Update - magically the app fixed it self the day after the developer responded. Weirdest thing but now I'm happy. Star rating updated Used to be great then it stopped detecting workouts. I genuinely dislike the layout. I was OK with it until it stopped detecting workouts. The app is basically useless to me now.
"I was very satisfied with this app, used to like it but since I had to give more permissions I became unsatisfied. I don't get why a fitness app needs permission to make and read my phone calls, to control or have a permission to read my contacts or to open my camera as a default. You are making these permissions as a stopper to open the app. forcing me is either giving the app all (non scene) permissions or not using the app!!! For sure will choose not to use it (I'm not in that BAD need to it)"
"Wildly inaccurate fitness tracking. Bought a Samsung active watch, walking workout logs as burning about 3x the calories you actually burn. No tracking for hiit workouts and no tracking for general weight lifting, you'd need to add the different weight lifting exercises independently, which just isn't practical. Wish i'd known this before hand or I wouldn't have purchased the watch. I'm in UK so don't know which country that number relates to that you've provided me in order to call!"
Useless since latest update. Weight management feature removed and pedometer not working. It skipped over 2000 steps for me. Thank god I didn't buy a galaxy watch like I was going to. Samsung just hamstrung itself with this one. Edit: Step counter was fixed but still not as good as prior to that update.
"I don't like the new version just as the previous reviews have already stated. My question is why do you actually need my contact list information? And the canned answers given to them do not answer why. Optimal experience is not sufficient enough. This should be rolled back. Plus, all phones have a locking ability whether we use it or not no need for the two-step verification. This should be optional not forced. 4/18/21 Samsung developer my question was not answered."
"Has decided to be able to require access to phone and contacts for mfa. Good grief just to count steps and use the built in pulse ox....the once amazing feature/app is now useless as i refuse to allow samsung to further invade my privacy. Breaking pulse ox feature seems like a bad idea for people with covid...users are now forced to sideload an older version incurring potential for malware it seems from the response I recieved from Samsung.-fix your app, it appears many users are unhappy now."
"Drains battery like crazy on Moto Z. No screen on time yet over 2% battery use per hour. Also, i don't see an option of not using phone for step count. Since it counts a bike ride as steps, would be nice to turn it off. Making a web interface is a must as well if you wanna play with Garmin and such."
"I have enjoyed using this app for several years but now that they have changed their permission requirements requiring I give them access to my entire smartphone I will no longer use this app. There is absolutely no reason why they need access to my camera, contacts, files and other privacy areas."
New version blocking on S9+. Older veraion working but Android keeps updating. Frustrating. I like the app for measuring oxygen spo2... 2 stars because old version was ok but new version not working ! Thank you for solving S9+ issue . Works very well now - change rating to 5* !
I loved this app until today when I saw that the update removed the Weight Management and The Caffeine features. The weight management feature was the most important form I relied on this feature for my weight loss goals. I'm really disappointed. Now I can't keep track of my weight management with my watch üò°
Many features removed from previous versions. Big example is pulse oximeter which is one reason I bought a Samsung phone. Because of that I don't see any reason to use this app over the Google Fit product. I wish I could roll back to a previous version
"Ads take up 1/3rd of the screen every time you use it with no option to remove it at all. Extremely frustrating. Contacted support, did not get an answer to my question other than ""it is a free app so there will be ads"""
"It was my favorite app for few days, but it shows inflated data, actual km covered in today run was 12.58 km(Decathlon app) Vs Samsung app showing 17.5 km. With the belief of this data I practiced for half marathon and failed to meet target time by big margin. I can give all details, screenshots, reports. They really need to do something on this. I have stopped using it, have you?"
I am very unhappy that the Samsung health app feels the need to require access to my phone with the new update. That is not appropriate. If I want to Grant access fine but the app should still work even if I deny phone access. this is not acceptable. I see the response from Samsung but the person who responded missed Point. It should NOT be required that is not right I don't care if you don't use it for anything else! I should be able to decline the use of the phone and still be able to use ap
Between the app and the new Samsung Galaxy Watch Active things are doing fine. I wish there was a high intensity interval training workout and or a spin class workout. A list of Les Mills workouts would be nice. I used the stationary bike workout for the Les Mills sprint class and I am sure I burnt more calories than what was said by the watch. I will try to use the Other Workout setting with it set on vigorous and see what happens. Any other suggestions are welcome.
"Definetly, ""sleep is not a waste of time and should receive the same level of attention as nutrition and exercise in the package for good health"" thus, Sumsung Health is really useful app but if it could connect to other apps such as ""clock"" and ""Bixbi Routines"", smart stay (night using time) for auto calculation of real sleeping time , it would be better..."
Its great but it would be good if when you are running you could choose the stats in the audioguide. Before there were the average workout stats and now just the ones for every km which i dont like and can not change.
It's pretty awesome but it could definitely use some extras! The ring of hearts would be a perfect widget! (Why isn't it?) (Plus seeing the heart rings of friends daily would be awesome) More competition stuff! Not just steps! Gamifying workouts should be more commonplace and Samsung should jump in the lead here!
"I have been using Samsung Health for almost 2 years now with no problems, until the last update in July. I can no longer connect to third party apps like my fitness Pal. If looking to download would wait till they get there stuff together."
"This app is awesome. I would like to know if there could be a way to have the app scan barcodes of the foods so it automatically upload the nutrional info and that way finds the exact food that I'm consuming. Other than that, the app is great, it helps me keep on track."
"This app needs to have a scanner for recording food and it needs to have some adjustments for when people add activities. For example if someone worked out on the elliptical is should have miles completed, how long, and maybe other tools to help determine how many calories burned for that workout. Also, those steps equivalent to that work out should be applied to steps over all for certain excersises."
Great watch app! love all the features but the ECG. it does not read my finger properly at all for measuring for a solid 30 seconds. quite annoying- they should check on the bugs for how that part of the app works through the watch.
"Latest update has made sleep tracking useless. Previous days' records only display one sleep period, with no way to view the night's cumulative sleep. As someone who routinely wakes up at night, that completely obscures the data."
"I like it alot but it is really amazing it doesn't have a period tracker, one of the main things for womens health. Secondly the calorie counting could offer kilojoules and have more likely serving sizes rather than all being 1 cup. Another app I use has a guide...tablespoon, teaspoon, handful, small bowl, matchbox etc as well as having likely serving sizes. For example, the serving size on Samsung health is 1 cup for coconut oil (you would die or vomit) and it's really more like 5ml needed."
"It has the best integration capabilities of any health tracking app. There is nothing more I could want in a fitness app. Every kind of tracking you could wish for, challenges, and fitness videos."
"EDITED ON 25th October 2018 - I am changing my rating to 1star today. It looks like the app is broken after all! This morning there was no sleep record and since 11am I have not been able to access anything within the app without it closing down. It tells me it has synced successfully with my Gear s3 but after that I can't access anything. Make the app work & bring back the homepage that was available prior to the update & I will change my rating to be more favourable. Since the update & the new homepage I have actually gained some weight that I had lost due to how helpful the old homepage was for me. Have a friend who feels the same in regards to the update. There is no point in us using it now. The info we need at a glance is buried & you have to go searching for it. ************************** Original review 3 stars - I have been using this app since June 2018 & would have been happy to give a 5 star review until the latest update. I don't understand why any of the changes were made.... it was better the way it was before this update. Not as user friendly as it was!!!! If it's not broken, don't fix it!!! EDIT 25th Oct 2018 Changed to 1 star today as it seems it is broken after all. No sleep record this morning and since 11am my time, the app is unusable. It keeps closing whenever I try to access anything after telling me it has successfully synced with my Gear S3. Up until the update mentioned in my earlier review I would happily have given a 5 star review. Get the app working & roll the home page back to the way it was in August & I will again edit my review to be more favourable. For now, it looks like I will have to install an alternative app to use."
"After installing the app, it asks for a two step verification. Once that is entered and submitted, the app doesn't allow me to continue to next step. I've never had this issue before. I've even tried updating and uninstalling to reinstall."
"Latest update is a disaster...earlier it was my fav app with precise step and distance count day wise but now after update i cant see my whole day walk , few slots are missing..also its not recording my running automatically.biggest issue is it shows 2019 data as my recent not of yesterday.... Very disappointed. Donot roll out updates if not tested fully..."
"This app is full of content. I can even track my exercises based on the specific activity. The sensors on the watch have a small delay when tracking lunges and sit ups. However, it's like having a personal coach!"
Like the app as it tracks me to the level i want. It is non intrusive and does not believe that fitness is the only motto of my life. At the same time it throwes challenges which keep me motivated. Good job. Keep it up!
I reviewed this app about 2 year ago and gave it 3 stars. I stopped using it for a while even. I resumed using it about 6 months ago and am very pleased with the updates. I am enjoying the added features as well as the improved accuracy with keeping up with my activity.
"The most comprehensive and well integrated life fitness system i have found to date. This app tracks so many things and stores it all in one place. Best of all, you can access ALL of your data as simple spreadsheets through a free app available on the samsung website. AMAZING"
It would be really cool if you could start including elevation changes in your tracking: I might walk only 1.5 mi. but it could be 60% up hill. I feel like that also affects calories burned. I feel like Google Fit does it but they don't have a watch. Thanks!
Great but latest version removes the minimal widget that shows simple step count without a target and 'Samsung health' text. Completely baffled that they'd remove this great feature - if you find the last version of the APK and turn off updates though you can restore it. Fix this and I'll update.
"I use this app every day for gym workouts and my step count and after the new update for the Galaxy Watch my phone no longer gives me the option to record steps exclusively from my watch and forces me to count ""all steps"" which makes my step count inaccurate. Really hope Samsung fixes this quickly."
"I enjoy keeping track of all the things. I would give it 5 stars if there was a website version that you could access with the computer that could show a calendar view of steps, and to run more reports. Fun app."
The app stops counting after sometimes. After doing as suggested still facing same issue. Also the walking and steps show different timings and steps. My walking time 45 min. Walking app shows 30.53 min while steps showed 23 min. Even for this I opened the app twice to reactivate as it stopped frequently
always running in background. can't be stopped starting.wasting power and memory. i do start this App when needed to sync with fit pro device and like to have full control over it. please respect this! it is really annoying.
I used to have galaxy s series phones up until my s8. But I broke the camera so I got a new phone. I decided to get the Samsung A51. I have been using this health app for years to track my water and mainly my step count. Now this phone isnt tracking my steps at all. And there is no customer service for this app unless you agree to have them take over your phone remotely. I really want to be able to continue on track with my fitness goals. But this is b.s.
What in the world did y'all do to this app??? üëÄ Omg! This app is so slow. I lost all of my saved meals. It takes for ever to enter and select a meal item. I have a S9. There was nothing wrong with the older version of this app. Revert back. This update is no good.
"What a mistake buying a gear sport watch. I'm using Strava because this app doesn't even login. I tried to reset phone, clear cache, turn on 2FA... It spins and spins forever. I had one Samsung phone in my life and was the worst experience ever. I have no idea why I got this piece of junk watch now with so many better options with better support out there."
"Their ""new"" update is just adding more to spy on users. There is absolutely ZERO reason for this app to require access to use my phone to make phone calls. Why, so you can read my contact list and spam people with calls and ads? Requiring 2fa to link a account is unnecessary and pointless. Better solution: REMOVE THE REQUIREMENT FOR AN ACCOUNT. No more problems. Everyone should avoid this Spyware at all costs. Better yet stop buying anything with the Samsung brand attached to it."
"Was 4 stars, changed to 1 upon most recent update. Update removed the functionality I used most. App no longer tracks trends and averages over given time spans. Wieght/BMI fluctuate throughout the day. The app no long displays long/short term trends or averages. Why remove functionality?"
The edit function for sleep tracking has been removed now I can not delete the times when my watch thinks I'm asleep when I am actually watching TV or just sitting quietly therefore gives false information. I used to be able to just delete one part of the nights sleep record with its own start and stop time not any more just the whole night.please fix ASAP
I really like this app! I have been using it to be more aware of how much food and calories I am eating and it really has a good tracking system. The only thing I wish they would fix is that the step counter tells me to try taking a walk right when I get up in the morning because I have no steps. But I have 0 steps because I have been sleeping haha. Otherwise an awesome app.
"The app is good at motivating us to walk more because of the monthly competitions, but it randomly stops counting steps. I've to force stop the app around 5 times a day for it to start counting again, and sometimes even that doesn't work."
"Suddenly the app is malfunctioning and causing issues with my fit watch. Please fix, it is draining my phone and not giving me notifications on my watch or freezing my watching all of the time in the last couple of days! I love this app and am very disappointed."
"Oh my goodness, I can't use the app now without giving it access to my phone number and setting up two-step verification? No thanks. I don't like having to be forced to accept some of these permissions just to use a health app. I'll just download a basic, free step counter app instead: apparently this one has ads now too so what's the difference."
"Lost access to everything after years of use, and without warning. They are asking for too many permissions for new functions that are made mandatory in stead of optional. Ie. allowing other people to search for you."
"It was great until the last update. Now, it's more difficult to track activities beyond steps and see past data in detail. Samsung seems to be downgrading features on many apps. Not going to be a user much longer if it continues."
"Very helpful. Track Calories, Breakfast,Lunch and Dinner. Records how many glass of water/caffeine were taken. Record steps. More programs are available such as yoga,boxing. Many exercises such as, hiking, walking,running etc. Record km. Or even calories burned! I highly recommend this app if you want a track of your progress. Ps. It wont track steps now. Pls fixed."
"I am using the app now for 2 months. Even a Day did not work as I mt should. It IS closing all the Time, some days it soes not track the staps... Connectong with fit e device is some Times ok, in majority not syncing... I used hours to try to solve the errors. Now Ia manalysing what the market offerw to try some other aollution before I stop using the apps and the device."
"Was very good before the update. Now I can't see my data in charts of days/months/years, and it just made it very difficult for me to access my data, especially the weights. I dont understand why you would take out the charts function. Please make a change to it."
All of the heart rat data for the past year just disappeared.!!! ISamsung also need to add an edit feature to the app for exercises. And the auto stride lengths are way off screwing up non-gps measured distances This also needs a separate editable setting.
"I am so frustrated with this app! I can't take my phone on the treadmill with me and because of that, it can't record my steps and after messing with the functions forever, I tried help online and apparently you can't add steps manually. This app is useless."
loved the app until they took the O2/hr sensor out on the new s21ultra. And it doesn't work on the older Samsung watch. Wish Samsung would leave the good alone. would also be nice if the first samsung watch read blood pressure like it was originally advertised. I have been an avid samsung supporter but some of the recent changes are really starting to make me rethink
The app was great before they removed the weight management system! I used it daily to track exercise versus caloric intake and it was really helpful. I wasn't interested in using other apps but now I may need to.
Since downloading this app I have lost 3 stone after failing 3 times to lose weight. I've never been very good with counting my calories but this app really helps with that. Highly recommend. I love it and will continue to use.
Very unhappy with the new update. I loved using this app for tracking my macros & micros. With the new update its much harder to see everything on one page. I miss the nutrient balance score and having everything basic on the original page.
Used this app for years. No reason you should need access to make calls on my phone. That's a deal killer. Have deleted the app since I can no longer use it. Update: The canned response to everyone rating this update with 1 star offers no resolution to the issue. The statement that Samsung just wants access to my phone and contacts to load the new version is laughable. Try fixing your update so it doesn't need access to my phone and contacts instead.
"The latest update deprecated the weight management function. I have been using it and it has helped me lose 25 lbs. Without this function, this app is basically USELESS to me. Restore the functionality, immediately!"
"The app was very useful, but the stair count is useless. I go up and down stairs all day and it rarely counts any. Latest version requires me to set up an account and share lots of personal information. Dropping it. Using S3 watch."
"Just dropped this down from 4 to 2. I have been using the app fine for years and liked the updates. However, since the last update the app is now asking for the ability to make phone calls when I accept the privacy statement. What in earth for? No explanation about this. The health app does not need this feature. Maybe the Samsung watch all, but not the health app. What are you up to Samsung, this is not good user experience."
After all these years Samsung still didn't add the functionality that is most calorie tracking apps: scanning an items bar code to add it to your daily tracking. I've reviewed this app a year ago with the same feedback and no change. Lowering the ratings.
"App worked great until a month or so ago, now it will not track steps, detect walking/running, and the heart rate/stress monitors don't work either. It may as well be a notepad for me to write down what I eat on. I don't know what changed, but I am quite disappointed."
"I loved this app when i had a Samsung phone some years ago so i downloaded it again. Unfortunately, it came with pop-up adds each time i turned on my phone. Deleted the app and no more pop-ups. Bad idea, Samsung."
I love the tools in this app and would give it a 5 but it won't sync my food off my fitness pal. I've reinstated both and still having issues. Please either fix the syncing issue or improve your food tracker to the quality and functionality of MFP with the code scanner and correct nutritional information please.
I WILL APPRICIATE. IF YOUR VIEWS OR ACTION IN HAND MAY BE INTIMATED. ELSE SAMSUNG HELTH INTERACTING APP OR DATABASE MAY BE SUGESTED THROUGH MESSAGE OR NOTIFICATIONS. Problem is in food selection. Searching is difficult. It would be more useful to search country wise or region wise. It will save time and accuracy food calorie and component accuracy will be high. Regards.
"I've loved S-health from day one. Up until the Feb Update which took sleek-looking, easy to see graphics & downgraded them into what looks like a kid's toy! Obviously Samsung are getting us ready for the upcoming removal of the physical sensors on our phones, & are making the in-phone app awful for no good reason! Very sad. Edit: telling me to phone Samsung for help isn't going to do a single thing outside of wasting my time & call charges, because this is the app and a call won't change it."
"Following the recent October update, the app no longer works properly. It records the number of walking steps but doesn't update the daily history correctly. I've uninstalled and reinstalled the app but it makes no difference. Please sort this out pronto!!"
"Like the app. However, it suddenly will not sync to other apps that have previously been synced. Customer service is aware.....hoping for a solution soon as I use this app with my watch and need to be able to sync to my virgin pulse account for work."
"Bad, misleading adds, a lot of informative pins and side gimicks that will cost you money. All the diet and helpful ideas will cost you a lot if you try them and it is hard to cancel them .... if you can. Anything they advertise ... you can find its equivalent for free."
"Why the app don't work anymore? The app didn't capture the distance and map routes of all my cycling trips in last 2 weeks. This week, it captures my hours of cycling but Okm! Last week each of my trips are recorded as only a few minutes with 0km despite hours of cycling! So your recent update is asking us to find a new alternative app to replace your app?"
Weight management removal : epic fail I loved this app until they removed the weight management. It would have been fair to let the user choose whether or not to downgrade the app and lose capabilities. Very disappointed. No updates so far to the lost capability of weight management removed over 1year ago. Plus now Samsung Health app does not sync with my Galaxy Watch 4 blood pressure and ECG. Seriously? Not even syncing in the same ecosystem?
"The new sleep data is a crook it gives you nothing no stages of anything, not pleased at all. I want it back to the way it was. I called 7 times and no one could figure it out, but I fixed it myself anyone having trouble should reset your watch. That fixed it for me"
It was okay at the start it use to Sync with my smart watch no problems now it won't but it's saying it's connected and if you sync it manually it says it's synced but it ain't it's really disappointing especially if you're trying to lose weight and want to keep record of your success
"This app used to be easy-to-use, it was perfect, but recently it has been undated into some kind of near version, I don't see the Daly intake values, is very hard to use and also from 6 meals it was reduce to 4, why? I just don't like it, please put it back the way it was."
For the most part it is a good app..however it never properly records stairs. Also there is know way the stress tracker is correct because no matter when I check it I'm at high stress. It never used to do that so now something is apparently jacked up with it.
Main feature removed? The main reason to use this app and help support a healthy lifestyle is the weight management feature which has ridiculously been removed. Do not get this app or a Samsung smart watch now. As they are basically a very expensive step counter. Awful decision Samsung and one you can see online is not working out well for you.
"Really love it, a simple way to track yourself via food and steps. A lifestyle game changer. Only reason its not 5 stars is because of the meditation function, the narrator's voice is disturbing, Making it difficult to relax. Other than that the app is solid üëå üí™"
"Fix your damn app. I had to install a previous version, start it without logging in, go to settings to log in, log in, update to the new version and only then did it work. All because the last update is broken when you try to log in. I hope you fix it and that this helps people with the same issue."
"I should know better than to update apps that are working perfectly fine. I appreciated the simplicity of the previous layout and the larger focus area for today's step progress, and the ease of getting to all previous day counts."
"Required permissions are a total invasion of privacy. I keep seeing responses about how these permissions are ""intended"" to be used. But nothing saying they will NEVER be used for other purposes. If these are truly used only for the together feature, then allow people to disable that feature and deny those permissions."
great app. would be nice if there was different levels in the competition. 200000 steps for older persons is a lot. maybe give us a choice of targets and slowly progress up to the 200000 steps challenge.
Really great app. Would love to see the calorie counter have a barcode scanner option due to some foods i cannot seem to find in the search. And also to add cups in the drop down servings box. Other than that great app!!
"I love watching how far I've come, and over a month it gives you allowance for bad days and you can make it up with really good days! Love the app - it's missing something but I can't put my finger on it! Otherwise perfect so still 5 stars!"
"The food tracking really annoys me. I have to enter descriptions of my homemade salad (no, I don't know how much everything weighs) and find this incredibly stressful! There has to be an easier way to track calories."
Step counter is not accurate. Workout times are not accurate. Sleep is not accurate. It's terrible. Now the app wants to access call features or you can't use it. I've uninstalled it. Complete garbage.
I have been using this app for several years now. Had to get a new phone. Now I can not track my stress level anymore. And I went from being on level 27 for my steps and now I'm back to level 2. All my numbers loaded but the level never carried over.
The food intake search is absolutely horrible! I went from My Fitness Pal to this app and was let down. I like all the other features but it really lacks when it comes to entering your food intake. There should be a way to scan food into the app.
"Samsung please fix this, I am not going to share call data, I'm not interested in Together or sharing information with friends. This combined with the battery wrecking recent Tizen update has made my otherwise great Samsung watch unusable. If Samsung want to operate like this and treat their customers badly then I might as well get a generic smartwatch and not pay the premium for a Samsung product that I was previously happy to do. Edit- the generic bot non- response from Samsung says it all."
"uninstalled, update requires to allow the app to make and manage calls? I don't think so. And I don't want to hear it's to improve my experience there is absolutely nothing in making and managing calls that will improve my experience. I want the app to do what I want it to do, not share every little bit of information with third-party data collectors. üñï I don't need it to identify my unique identifier for the together feature, I don't want it. It's all data collection. I now give it üñïüñïüñï"
"Suddenly having issues. Doesn't always seem to sync up correctly with my Gear and this morning I couldn't open the app at all. Just getting ""unauthorized access where made to your phone contact customer service"" no idea what happened."
"Can no longer use my FitBit with Samsung Health. I used to use the Health Sync app to record my daily steps in Samsung Health, now Samsung has revoked the ability of all third party apps to write data in it and because of this won't let me sync my steps or other exercises between Fitbit and Samsung. Google Fit works fine with my Fitbit, so I'll be switching to it until Samsung fixes this issue and lets apps like ""Health Sync"" write data in Samsung Health again."
Update jan. 2021: app still lacks the feature making it as generic as the other apps it competes with. Loved the app until the recent update where they removed the ability to set a weight loss goal and told you how intense you could make your workouts and calorie count.
Was a really good app. However with the latest update it no longer breaks down or tracks my sleep. Even tho my gear fit watch says its recording it. Doesnt show on my phone. Very disappointed. If it isn't broke dont fix it. Simple
"Steps is not very accurate, I have some difficulty getting it to measure my heart rate, especially when it is beating fast. I wish it would also track my heart beat for a period of time instead of just once then having to measure repeated times."
"It's so frustrating when you're 90 minutes into a cardio workout, and you see the app has only tracked 22 minutes! The stats are then worthless, throwing off daily and weekly goals and progress."
cannot sync to fitbit for steps (or even my fitness pal) its samsung health default step tracker or nothing. I can't/don't always carry my phone on my person to record my steps but my fitbit is always on my wrist. makes the rest of the stats redundant as calories/workouts/fitness trackers become inaccurate also.
Not happy after the update. I loved using the weight control aspect where it should you how many calories burned throughout the day vs calories consumed. I was following it and finally broke through the weight loss plateau I had been experiencing. I'm very disappointed in this update.
"I try to use this app regularly, with my last 3 phones, And it worked very good for what I wanted to use it for, but now I find out I have to give permission for my contacts to get the ""optimal"" experience. That Explanation does not make sense explain to me, in detail, exactly how you having my contacts gives me a better experience than I have, which I have been more than satisfied with up till now. Without a detailed explanation you've lost me"
This app would be better if there was local challenges instead of global. This app would also be better if it was compatible with other apps too. I have the Samsung watch but cant participate in group challenges with my friends because the app isn't compatible. I might get a different watch because of this.
"I really like this app. Wish the notifications where customizable (food, water, caffeine input reminders more often) I would also like to see mapped out routes like mapmyfitness.. it's the only thing that makes me keep that app.. everything else is grest."
"I truly enjoyed this app. All of a sudden, (within the last 2 weeks) when I open the app, it shuts down and I end up on my home page. I refreshed my phone, (Samsung Galaxy Note 10 Plys) keep turning it off and then turn it back on, to no avail. Please help me out."
"Unfortunately the app became bad. It can't track my all steps, just a few of them. For instance, When I was achieving 1500 steps in the Huawei Health app, I was achieving only 46 steps in the Samsung Health app. Before it was very good now I don't know what happened. All settings were in the right choices but there was no usefulness."
"I used to love this app. It allowed me to sync from my other devices (data sharing). But then, Samsung got greedy and I am not able to sync it anymore. Samsung wants me to use only Samsung devices. Well, good bye Samsung health. I thought Samsung was different from Apple in that it understood its customers. Thanks for proving me wrong. Y'all just went backwards."
"I want to be able to uninstall this bloatware. Android has become literal garbage after programs started to come preinstalled with no actual safe way to uninstall them. Disabling leaves the app on my phone, occupating memory and resourses, which is not the same as comoletely uninstalling the app."
"Great app until they did away with the ""Weight Management"" function in the latest update. Not sure why they did this. This was the one feature I couldn't get with other apps. Hoping they put it back or I'll be looking elsewhere"
"App worked great & I loved it then I updated it today now I've had to do a force stop to get repetitive messages about how it cannot open on a rooted device & of course its rendered the app utterly useless. My phone's operating system has not been tampered with it was purchased directly from Sasktel all updates have been from Samsung only. I shouldn't of updated this update is the worst. ü§¨ After uninstalling & clearing cash√® it still wasn't working, had to do it again plus restart now works"
Hey..!!! Could you please add these feature to the app. 1. Stop Time duration when distance is completed and vice versa also. Except all features. Some of my friends are preapring for INDIAN ARMY PHYSICAL RUNNING. If you add this feature it helps us a lot to track running time duration. Please have a look on my request.üôèüôè Thanks in advance...
The update to the app today is just what I've been waiting for. You can now easily scroll back though your workouts where as before it was just the last 30 days. The new graphics and theme is refreshing as well. This update means I can finally ditch Strava completely as it now has everything I need. Thanks Samsung 5 stars üëçüëç
Cannot sign into account with this useless Samsung app - sort this mess out Samsung. Nothing in cache memory as this is a new install on a new (non Samsung) phone. So your advice is as bad as your security nonsense. This is ALL your doing and USELESS is the word that springs to mind will avoid all Samsung Tech in the future as a result of this useless customer support.
Bring back total distance for days/weeks/months/years No one wants an adverage distance... we need to see total distance covered from one set date to a different set date I was completing a 2000 mile chalange and i was using this fitness app as a record of my distance but now you have removed this option i can not complete it
"App was working. Now when we try to scroll ot access blood pressure tracking, the app hangs and closes. I contacted the developers, since then, the issue we were experience has been corrected. Thanks to the developers."
"This is my first smart watch and am quite liking it, main issue I've been having is active calories burned. These are calories burned just by being active throughout your day via steps, moving etc. They are completely off, these past 3 days I've been seeing numbers upwards of 5,000! You have to work out for hours to see that type of result. Saw the same issue in an Amazon top review, there was a women with exact problem. It's a bug I hope they fix soon."
"Wonderful till modified, now not happy at all! Have COPD and was very happy with the ability to check my O2 and record it's trends. Unfortunately, Samaung decided to incorporate multiple definitive test into some obscure thing called STRESS. One of those definitive test was the O2. Now I have to wait twice as long to get a more vague answer to what I need. I wish Samsung would have followed the rule ""If if ain't broke dont fix it!"" Of course getting them to change it back is impossible."
"This app is wonderful. It's simple, straightforward, and easy to use. Although, I wish there was a feature with the sleep tracker where you could add in naps and such, even though that's not totally healthy and all, but it'd be nice to have some tips on how to stay away during the day."
"First, why does the app keeps persistently running in the background ? I would give five stars if it could track via gps the distance travelled. The app is no use to me as I have to download Runtastic just for this tracking feature which is missing in Samsung Health. Developers may kindly look into this."
"I love this app all around. The nutrient score and break down of macro and micro nutrients is exceptional. Free workouts for a variety of levels, the ability to connect with and encourage your friends, it doesn't get much better than this."
"Its good to Count daily Calorie deficit to achieve target weight but there is no calender to check record of previous days. Daily progress needs to be mentioned with dates in calender. Kindlly add this feature. There should also be a Target weight loss Calculator in this app. So that one can get the estimate of target date and recommended Calorie intake. Hoping to see these features soon, thanks."
"Since the last update the app does not accurately track steps or miles. It doesn't provide any errors and I have full bars so no reason to show 0 miles/steps after a walk, run or bakeries. I have used the app for years and am now very disappointed"
"Good app, MS Paint 1995 widgets, Edit: Thanks but people don't need to ring another country over widgets, that's why we have comments on Playstore. Second and final edit: Deleted it entirely as Samsung decided to update it twice without my permission, I caught the silent notification, twice, FING freaks."
Just started to use this App for a week now. Overall it is easy to use but does not have too many function or allow me to edit. Such as change the name of work out activity (cannot find CrossFit). I cannot view the work out activity in a monthly basis summary. Does anyone know how??
"Used all the time to track my walks. However since the latest update, the app can't work out the accurate speed I am walking. ie after 1 mile app reports, distance 1 mile, time 15 mins, average speed 2.8 miles an hour. Now I am no mathmation, but even I know if I have walked for 15mins and covered 1 mile, then my average speed is 4 mph."
"It does what it says it will do. Tracks your steps, your sleep, and your water intake. But my problem lies in the calorie and nutrients tracker. It really doesn't work too well. I drank an entire cup of milk, logged it, and no calcium was logged for it. There is especially a problem with logging vitamins and supplements. Please update it."
"I used to love this app, especially the sleep tracker but as many other people are stating, it isn't really working anymore. I tried the fix they suggested in another comment to clear the cache, force stop the app, and restart my device but no dice. I really hope they fix this soon!"
"This new design looks very sleek, i like it a lot, app itself is very easy to use, and i lost 15+ kg in just 4 months using it. Wish there were more Russian and Asian quisine in food menu to add though, otherwise it's great."
I used to love this app on my old phone but I brought a new phone and it seems there is a bug where the app won't start and gives a security message stating your phone is rooted when it isnt and the app can't start . Any fix for this coming soon ? please don't send me that generic message telling to call that overseas phone number when I'm based in the UK. sort it out samsung UPDATE - your instructions don't work NEW UPDATE - I don't live in America so I'm not calling this number. This issue is n
"I previously used the app as an assist for tracking weight management. Unfortunately, the recent update has removed the plus/minus calorie weight management function. Really disappointed as that was the main feature I used the app for. Samsung Health was a 5 star before the update."
"Lately it just stops counting steps. It shouldn't be my job to solve this, no matter it's just clearing cache. Also it is not normal to reinstal every week this. Maybe you should learn a thing or two from Sony's app which is by far better in every way. Disappointing!!! And to make even worse they reply by telling me to do exactly what i have already done. Thank you very F-in much. That confirms me they the developer has auto reply for bad ratings :))"
"Not very useful, but it could be. It only lets you select 3 exercises. It would be awesome if you could build a circuit or interval workout using all the different exercises."
"App for monthly challenge is not giving the stars as intended, I have made more steps than required and in the time required, but if I dont check the app manually I dont get rewarded. This robs me of my earned exp rewards, kind of useless for even accepting the challenge if it isnt going to work right."
I am highly disappointed with the recent changes to Samsung's health app. How can a company be so clueless as to make such a debacle of this app. I had been seriously considering moving to an iPhone and an Apple Watch. Thanks Samsung for making this decision much easier... Additional thought. How does One UI 3 have anything to do with the Samsung health app itself? I am on One UI 2.5. Once again a debacle!
"The app opens up, i get to the login screen, then nothing. It keeps loading forever ... Update: I tried the method provided, nothing changed. Update 2: I bypassed logging in after installing the app, I got to the home page then I logged in from the settings tab ...."
"Why does the app ask for a login? Also if I click login it shows account already exists in account manager!?? Couldn't use the app at all! Please resolve this issue! I already have an account but it couldn't be accessed and the app isn't opening only. So kindly note, the issue is not about not having an account!"
"It's a fantastic app to compete and compare how active you are to the rest of the world. It's great at motivating you to get outside. And there are endless activities you can do on it. The only problem I had was that the app stopped counting my steps, but all I had to do was reinstall the app and it's working fine to this day!"
"Application stoped recording move using GPS, tends to cut step counter by 30%. Step counter was always different comparing to other. But I really liked GPS training which used to work good in the past. Training programs in app need to get some kind of rating or opinions. Also calories burned is behaving weird; you can make 10 pushups and burn more calories than making 30 or 12 minutes of hard circuit training burns less than 15 squats."
on new A70 it doesn't count correct step nor close to the actual steps. I compare it with Google map and its shows 3.6km and this app shows 2km and My old note 3 works fine it shows 3.99km (which is close ). I'm expecting this will count almost exact steps and distance but üòï
"No respect for private information. Read the privacy agreement. This app actually has some nice features, but it wants access to way too much personal infornation. Why does a fitness app need access to my contacts, messages, and calls? Very disappointing."
Latest update (5th August 2020) has ruined the app. Taking away the weight management section which was a key component of the app seems a strange idea with no warning. New colour scheme makes it hard to distinguish between Carbs and Fat macro as they look to me to be the same green colour. Currently wouldn't recommend to download the app and to seek alternatives.
Bring back the weekly and monthly charts for weight! Seeing daily figures is rubbish for identifying longer term trends. Also the the standard deviation in the charts needs to return also. Stupid that you have trend charts for steps etc but not for weight!
"Honestly? You want me to input my birthday by paging forward or back one month at a time? For, in my case, 40 years??? Unless I""m missing something, 480 button presses to input a datum is a new low in UX design. Same thing with food entry ... inputting grams of food, you get to scroll ... by a tenth of a gram. Give me a freakin' numeric keypad, already. Some parts of the user interface are just mind-boggling dumb. Let me know if I'm missing something here ..."
"Overall I like the app but it would be SO much better if there was a way to creates notes and have them saved in the same date/time format as all the measurements that are recorded. A couple fields have note lines but they are a) too short, b) not on all fields and c) none are universal across all measurements."
Samsung health doesn't sync right with galaxy watch. Steps are always different on app than watch. Why can't it sync both ways.... Misses loads of steps due to first 15 missing each time. 6500 normal in a class is barely 5000! Going back to fitbit!!!!!!
"Just updated my Moto g2 force this weekend. Now EVERY 3 minutes i get a message stating that Samsung Health is not responding. I chose the option to close app on my phone and 3 minutes later it's back up again. I tried contacting the developer, but email listed is a noreply email box. I've been to Samsung's website with no links to app support. Fix it soon or I'm dumping the app and possibly my gear watch as well."
The app is overall good for health tracking but automatically updates steps. I completed 6021 steps at a time and noticing after some time (2 hrs) it automatically updated the step count to 6093 and I remember of not moving even a single inch in that time period.
"App is easy to use, wish it had a couple of the following features 1) A breakdown of Lifetime steps, 1 year, 3 months, monthly and weekly totals. 2) easier to add friends and do friendly challenges. Similar yo how fitbit has its own group challenges/adventure challenges"
"Like the app and what it does but one thing I really would like to see is the capability of zooming in to see the steps taken for a period of time. For example, if I look at today's steps I can see the progress bars of what I did but can't quite tell how many at what time. I'd like to be able to dig down by hour. Can this be added?"
"I like the app overall, but don't see the sudden need to allow permissions for files, contacts, phone, etc. I allowed just long enough to get back into the app and then denied them all again."
"This just keeps getting less user friendly with each update! Now you took away the ability to see other people's friends list. I used to only challenge the people who had me in their friends list. Now there's no way of telling. These are not upgrades, they are downgrades. Every time you take away more and more options! JUST DELETED THE APP, DECIDED THE FRIENDS LIST WAS TO IMPORTANT SO I'M LOOKING FOR ANOTHER APP. DELETED ALL SAVED DATA, GOD BYE SAMSUNG HEALTH..."
"Poor. When trying to save what I recorded manually it wouldn't accept it. After entering height & birth date for BMI it disappeared after ""saving"" but didn't calculate and doesn't appear anywhere nor does it give me the opportunity to enter again...harvested info. I suppose."
"BRING BACK THE WEIGHT MANAGEMENT SECTION! Why remove an entire feature???? Sometimes, when changing the number of servings of a food item, the app will not register the change, even if the change is displayed. As soon as the number is saved, it will revert back to the default number. Needs a barcode scanner."
"It is a good app, but you should adjust it for the places you live in. For example, if i eat something and i want to check it on the phone, i only have american options and I unfortunately live in Romania where we do not use most of those... So that part gives me a hard time..."
So frustrated that the new update removed weight management. This was my main reason for using the app and the ability to see how I was doing on calorie intake compared to calories burned for a day was great. Really disappointed in the removal of this.
Great app and I would love to carry on using it but I had to change from Samsung devices to Garmin for sport and unfortunately Samsung does not support Garmin devices and now they will not allow for the data to be synced. Looks like I will have to move to an alternative health app. Would give 5 stars if they supported Garmin watches.
"Loved this app for years, and told people about it. Over the years the cool added content slowly went away. Suddenly the best features disappear. Not much use anymore so I decided to disable the app. It was wasting storage."
"Missing a key feature - pill tracker. Also, some functionally was cut over the updates, would like to see pulse/oximeter come back, the phone and the watches have hardware for it, and it used to work with the older phones, why remove it? Pill tracker and oximeter would give this app 5 stars!"
"Whatever Samsung update that just happened, it's now not working. Out says it can't open because my phone is rooted, but my phone is NOT rooted. I called Samsung support and they couldn't figure it out. It's a shame too because I really like tracking my steps. It worked fine just a week or two ago. I wish someone could tell me how to fix it."
"This app is perfect for those who want to keep track of their physical fitness. The app is easy to use and automatically tracks your steps without requiring you to leave your location on. It also lets you track your sleep, nutrition, weight, and a few dozen forms of exercise."
Wish there was a way to edit a sleep entry without deleting the whole thing. Also would like to be able to interact with the data showing what times where light sleep etc. Like you're able to with a Fitbit.
Used this app for some years and the recent update has made a right mess of it. The GPS tracker is now way off and does not register 75% of my run anymore. Really disappointing. Have to look for something more reliable.
"Brand new watch, signed in to Wear app with my old samsung account, no can do with the Health App. Please fix this. I shouldn't have to call you... Just fix it. (No, clearing cache doesn't work.) Spinning icon after two step verification, now I have to wait 30 minutes because I tried too many times. This is rediculous. I feel like I made a mistake getting a Samsung device again. Again, no, I'm not spending my time on the phone with you. This should just work. I'm returning this watch."
Really disappointed keep taking items away On the App and on the watch The main thing I really needed was the weight management now it's gone why do I still have this then. I feel I give the weight management does not come back with the next update I feel like I might go back to fit bit !! I am so very disappointed in this app and the creator's right now Please bring back The weight management
"Recent update to privacy policy far too invasive for me. As of the latest update collects and sends out all of your personal info along with every physiological measurement you take. A shame, an otherwise useful app, looking for a replacement now. Edit: Got a new phone, noticed the permissions had eased so gave it another go.. And two weeks later it demands contacts and calls permissions for a feature I don't use. Ffs lads."
This was a great app until the last update now when you put in a workout like stretching and the phone puts in more than you have done you can not adjust it!! Also its geared toward the American market and doesn't always understand English! Its a shame as it was a good app!!
"The app doesn't record my workouts. I have been following the beginners program to run 5k. It recorded the first three. But after that whenever I press finish workout, it just freezes. Please resolve this issue ASAP."
"Keeps getting worse, used to be a good app but every other month they get rid of another service. Now there's not much left. All scanning has been removed, you can buy a heart monitor strapped across your chest, but that doesn't help with the other 95% of your day. I would have paid a few bucks a month just for the ease of checking things with just a finger, but it's gone and the app is useless now. Uninstalled"
"amazing app, very useful, it makes me become healthier, but we need the ""stairs"" counter. and it would be lovely if a notification appear when someone is feeling lazy and not moving, the app should be like ""you are not moving today! are you okay? get up and take a good walk!""."
"The first time I used it, it was fantastic! The second time I tried it was completely different. I could only see my steps. I was not able to track my walk like I did the first time. Could not find any exercise options. I even tried uninstalling and reinstalling to see if that would fix it to no avail."
"EDIT Response from the app developers were very quick. I called customer support, and the guy was super nice. I believe his name was Jim or Tim, but whomever I talked to made my day. Thank you! PREVIOUS write after the update today, it appears I cannot open my app because my phone is rooted. my phone isnt rooted. i dont know what's going on. and even if I do something else on the phone, it pops up like a virus or malware. I dont get what they did with their security update, but it needs fixing."
"Very disappointed to find Spo2 no longer logged. This was a very important feature for me as I need to monitor daily my oxygen levels. It was also badly done in that it erased all stored data. The facility to check and record Spo2 data was the main reason I bought a Galaxy phone, if this is an example of the way Samsung treats its customers this may be my last Samsung phone. Please restore this facility SAP."
"I had been using the Samsung Health App that sync with a fitness app, Singtel StepUp without any issues. However, over the last 2 days the app no longer sync with my fitness app. The Grant Permission is showing up on the sync error or warning. How do I remedy this"
"This is a great app that does what it says it does. Thanks. Now that Samsung and Google are on the same smartwatch page, would you please update this app to sync with Google Fit directly? I know you can use a 3rd party app, but I'm quite sure Wear OS 3 will sync directly with G Fit. It would be really good and make us Tizen people feel that we're part of the ""family""."
"UPDATE as of April 9, 2019 this app starting working tracking my steps again!! Thanks for listening to my concerns! since my galaxy 8s plus updated last week. this app stopped counting steps. I uninstalled and reinstalled it. Still Nothing!! I loved this app at one time!!"
Step counter: absolute flop. Me and a friend have been using this for about a month now... after walks not registering I started monitoring it a bit more closely. I have literally walked around my house counting up to 100 steps while only 1 registered on the app. I can take the exact same route time and time again and the step count will be anything from 500 to 7000. For the exact same distance. Do NOT use this app.
Would be good if Samsung allowed syncing to other health apps (Fitbit). I love the app and wish I could use it with my Fitbit that I already own instead of having to buy a new tracker. Also wish the app had a place to log body measurements and ability to connect to a smart body tape measure.
"Not working. Recording miles/time during run but the distance isn't kept. Keeps saying 0.0 after saved. Also new update, don't like navigation that I can't pause easily for sprints and can not go into lock mode to save battery."
"Had trouble with the update. Called the number given. Had a friendly informative person help me. My app is now working and I'm very excited! I rely on this app for my fitness and health issues. It connects me with like minded fitness people. I love joining the challenges. This is a great motivational app, and my number 1 go to, as I have used Fitbit, Under Armor, and Runtastic."
Just wondering why there is not a scanning option to scan labels versus attempting to guess the values of the food you are eating? The lists of foods on the app are very incomplete and the portion amount is confusing. I will utilize another app until this app is improved.
When i first downloaded this app it worked fine but lately inconjunction with myfitnesspal the exercises and or steps i am recording through tracking on samsung health are duplicating multiple times on myfitnesspal app. This has never happened before. I uninstalled and reinstalled both apps and it continues to do this. Hopefully you can help.
"I had been using this app for quite awhile. I had to replace my phone and lost all my data. Also. when I downloaded the app, it did NOT create an icon. I have to go into Playstore to enter data. This is a problem."
This used to be a great app and the reason why I got an active watch but the weight management and coffee tracking were removed. This is a big disappointment to me as those were the features I used a lot. Bring them back please.... it's a health app.
A great app for monitoring weight diet and exercise. I like the monthly challenges but wish they would divide them into age/ability groups. It is imposible to compete with the marathon runners or cheats who finish the entire challenge in a day or two.
"Really liked using this app to track steps/walk durations and heartrate. But with the new privacy policy I won't be using it anymore, there is no reason it should need access to my phone permissions. I don't care what the new ""features"" are that require it, let us opt out."
Good all around app for tracking fitness. Easy to use. Wish walking maps was available from 'Steps' menu directly. Food tracking is mostly complete. Wish it had more nutrition details. I like it overall.
"I downloaded this app to try and better myself. I am personally WELL AWARE that I am overweight, and getting in shape is long overdue. However, I do not appreciate (or find it motivating or funny even in the slightest way) to receive notifications that say ""Goodmorning Fatty"" due to inactivity. I work 9+ hour shifts, 5-6 days a week and during these shifts it is required of me to not have my phone on my person. So while my phone just sits there for (at least) 9 hours, I am on my feet and moving nonstop. I can't believe how insensitive Samsung is. I just want to go throw up every time I eat. I hate my body more than ever now that I have given birth to two kids. I will never recommend this app to my friends and family, and I will never download it again. I don't know if it gets worse, or if they find nicer things to say, but I won't stick around to find out. I will get fit, I will lose weight, and I will do it without being bullied by Samsung."
"Forces you to create samsung account, asks for many unnecessary info, then you cant login. I verify my phone number (not sure why i even need to do this) then i get an error message and cant login and i am stuck there. 00000 stars. If you force people to create accounts to use their info for ads and other moneymaking stuff for you at least make sure it works. 0 stars!"
I love this app it's great for tracking my steps when I'm in step challenges at work. The only thing I dont like is when you are entering food that you cannot scan barcodes of food. It would make things so much easier
The app causes lag while syncing with android phones orher than samsung. My galaxy watch 3 data is not synced regularly with my one plus 7 Keeps showing no device connected even when the device is connected. I have also experienced phone getting heated up while trying to sync my watch with my phone
"It used to be much better when you could see weekly or monthly averages as well as weekly or monthly high/ low for weight. Now there is only the chart, which is not as useful for tracking."
"Like! Great step and distance tracking app. However, in weekly and monthly trend, it would be great if it show total step, total distance and total cal too. Currently, it just display average values..."
"Syncing has slightly improved since my last feedback in January but the related services (Gear Plugin and Accessory service) are draining the battery like crazy. My OnePlus 7 Pro battery is draining down from 100 to 25 in 4-6 hours, consistently showing these two services as culprits. They are using 15-25% battery for last 2 weeks or so."
It keeps telling me I need to agree to permissions. I have......over and over again and still won't let me use. This app came with my phone and was wonderful but all of a sudden I couldn't use. I deleted amd downloaded again and still the same problems.
"Good app, but gutted that Samsung removed the SP02 measurement tool for no reason. I'd like some of my money back for the cost of thw phone please Samsung, after you've disabled one of the hardware features. Additionally, Samsung's response is to direct you to an American support phone number, forgetting their devices are sold around the world. Fail."
"I know longer have a Samsung but the app is great for tacking my steps, keeping track of my meals and water intake. I went from maybe 500-1000 steps daily to 10000 consistently! All because this app keeps me motivated. Give it a try, if you don't like it,you can always uninstall it."
"I really want to Like this app, but it does not read my steps or activity correctly. I have connected my fitbit but it doesnt read it. I even connected my fitness pal. Doesnt read that either. It says i cant change default step count. I didnt MAKE a default. I want fitbit to be my default. Would love ro uae the app, but xant even find help!"
"I've used Samsung Health for about five years and loved it. However, the recent permission change is a deal-breaker. Don't bother telling me that it's for ""overall better experience"" because if that were true, it wouldn't be REQUIRED to use the app at all. If it's required for the ""together"" feature, then make it required for the together feature. Whether or not Samsung has nefarious intentions is irrelevant because DATA BREACHES HAPPEN and hackers don't care about privacy policies. No thanks."
The removal of weight management especially calorie counting and the loss of my history has been devastating. I know it is not the app developers fault someone made a bad paradigm decision and thought removing the most useful part of the app was a good decision. This change means i need to find a different app to use with Dana Faber to manage my food intake and be able to show them at each visit.
"I am tired of the app constantly telling me I have a rooted phone. I have a new note 8 and never rooted it. They need to fix this problem and make it compatible with a Samsung phone. Sucks. So the response from Samsung is reboot, what a cop-out poor response. FIX THE DAMN PROBLEM!!! WHAT IS THE ROOT CAUSE, Why do I have to force stop and reboot at least twice a month, poor poor response!!!!!!"
It didn't track my steps nor the floors I climbed. I even had it connected with my watch. The watch app doesn't calculate very well either. Neither app kept track of my activity level. Which told me I had been inactive while I was out walking around the park for 30 minutes.
"This app used to be excellent before this last update. Now it just shows the last 30 days (so I lost all the records and it turned to be useless) and I can't just open the app and start the activity I want in the homescreen anymore. It was the only app I had to track my activities, now I will need to find something else."
"I'm having some difficulty connecting this app to my Fitbit, but maybe that's on my end. My only other criticism is that the food library is somewhat lacking compared to other apps like Fitnesspal. Love the walking and work out challenges though, great for accountability."
"While currently there is a weekly summary of all activity, a monthly summary option(Total Distance walked, Average per day, Average Calories, etc) would have been a great help. Something to look forward to in the next update i hope."
"I like the ease of the Samsung Health APP in recording my daily steps, but an issue has developed. About ten days ago the APP started randomly recording some of my steps on the current day and then switching to record them on the previous day. I have not been doing anything differently."
"I really like the ap. I track meals, steps, it connects with my Sansung Watch. Two challenges: It does not track steps accurately on a treadmill in the running challenges, and the watch does not either. Also, the monthly challenges are always topped by members reaching 100,000 steps a day. Several online blogs attribute this to hackers."
"I have bought exclusively Samsung products for the last 4-5 years, and I can tell you that I Am truly thinking I'll be getting something different when my A10 goes out. I am very disappointed that I am no longer able to use my Gear 2 with my Note 8 in the Samsung Health app as it keeps telling me that i have to sign in but won't let me. I used to use the many of the features that I had with getting them both 4/5 years ago. Totally disappointed in the quality now."
"Really enjoyed this app but see no reason it needs to have access to my contacts or phone calls. Uninstalling it and searching for a replacement. I don't need to hear any garbage about ""these permissions are necessary for optimal user experience"". I had an ""optimal experience"" with this app prior to the update, which proves the new update permissions now required are absolutely not necessary. >:("
"This app would be 5 stars if it allowed you to add or edit a workout. When I run on the treadmill the miles and calories are not accurately recorded, but I just have to accept how my Gear recorded it and Samsung Health stores it. Allow me to edit the workout to accurately reflect what I did!"
"I used this app daily forever, but the recent update just deleted the feature I used the most! No more weight maintenance? That's the entire reason I used the app. Now all my data is gone and I can't see any of my hardwork anymore. Samsung, the weight maintenance is what set you apart, that was the whole reason I kept you after downloading and deleting so many apps. If you add it back, I may consider reinstalling, but as of now, it no longer serves a purpose. :("
Seems like I'm not the only one with issues being able to open the app after having to update my preferences to let the app make phone calls. Why would it need it make phone calls? Doesn't say anything about that in the user agreement.
why would you remove the feature that reminded you to do lunges or torso twist when it identified inactivity? I regularly used that feature. I have contacted Samsung regarding issue and still no resolve. The fact that you guys only replied with a phone number is the reason why I've changed my star rating.
it's a nice app. but i absolutely cannot stand that in the running excercise there isn't an option to turn off warm up and cool down. How am i gonna measure my pace accurately if it averages it with walking for 10 minutes? makes no sense at all
"Won't let me log in after most recent update. It just buffers forever and never works. I have uninstalled and reinstalled and it refuses to work. Very upsetting since I just got a new Samsung watch and now it is useless, because this app doesn't work"
"New update makes the app unusable. Used to love this app, but now I can't even log in. It doesn't even let me set up the two-step verification. I get the code and enter it but it doesn't let you click verify, even after entering in the code. Really disappointed with the new update."
The app is pretty good. It'd be nice if we could view weight in stone and lbs as that's the standard in the UK. Also I'd like to be able to look at weight graph for a year to see a longer trend. Both of these can be done in myfitnesspal.
In the last update they went from a 2x1 to 5x1 widget for my phone's home screen and there's no additional useful information to warrant such a big increase in size. I liked having it on my main screen but now have to keep it on the 3rd screen just to have space for it. So disappointing.
I use this app daily for weight loss and exercise! It syncs up to my watch and has been great! I have noticed since the 25th that the burnt calories are no where correct. I do anywhere from 10k to 23k steps a day. Adding from 1100 - 2300 burnt calories. Now it's telling me I'm burning up in the 10k's. There is no way possible! I use these #'s for weekly doc appts. Please fix this asap!!
"I've lost 111lbs so far since October 2018. Samsung Health has helped me to easily identify noticable trends in my restingheart rate, sleep averages, stress, blood pressure and so much more. Utilizing this app along with the Galaxy Watch which also updates my step and other data has been a big corner stone of my current success in personal health improvement. I would highly recommend and can only look forward to updates in the future."
i hate the samsung ads at the top of the page. it takes up screen space and I'm not switching phones. it doesn't share good with other fitness app! screw you Samsung. The app has good features and tge sleep tracker seems to work as expected. About on par with fetbit.
"Fantastic app. Perfect as a food and exercise diary. I keep finding new useful features. Only complaint I have is it doesn't sync with my smart band, but I found a workaround."
"Great app, very useful.. it would be great however (@developers) if you guys could make a widget for the other functions as well.. not just the step count but like on the smart watch, also the period tracker widget.. maybe even like on the smartwatch a sumary of all in a neat compact widget."
"I really really really love all the features in my galaxy note5(including s health) so much that I'm addicted to it and now upgrading to note9. But this problem, that you won't collaborate with any other app but yourself, is a bit disappointing! I have an honor band5 and I'm dying to sync my steps with s health so I can set 1:1 challenges with my friends. You won't let google fit or anyother app to participate and that is just sooooooo depressing. I actually cried over it!!!"
User interface and interaction are amazing on the Samsung Health app. You can get a free personalized training and trainer to assist with your exercise. Challenges and goals which keep motivation going especially when you are doing it a by yourself. 100% this app gets 5 stars.
needs to be more customizable. Needs to be able to set calories better like it use too. a scanner would be a nice touch to log in food and for people who are on different types of work shifts there should be a custom time to log in meals also.
"App is OK in general, but it's seems impossible to do cardio and watch movie at the same time. If I switch task, the app pauses the workout. It seems developers expect users to watch running man for 28 minutes nonstop."
"I created two account on Samsung health app, I use OnePlus 3 smartphone. I'm facing difficulty in logging in to my account. As I put password and press sign in, it keeps rotating for eternity and I'm stuck in that page not able to proceed further. I recently bought a fit 2 band and wanted to track my activity through Samsung health app. Please help me solve this issue."
"Was great before mandatory update. After reading reviews of Samsung needing more personal info, such as personal contacts. ""Required for a better experience "" ...hmmm, whatever. Also, I lost all my previous data...even after ""$ynching""... Looks like my user experience is.worse, not ""better enhanced"". I will delete this app."
The last update absolutely ruined this app for me not only does it require permissions that the app in no way needs to work but recently it stopped counting my steps properly and has become totally useless. I use this app to count my steps in conjunction with another app I use everyday and samsung health has also ruined my experience in that app as well. VERY DISAPPOINTED!! If only they would allow you to give 0 stars
"The updated version is very poor. While walking, app discontinues recording despite having full internet connectivity. I am experiencing this problem every day. Previous version was better. Please fix the bug ASAP."
"I used to use this app all the time and absolutely loved it. But I think it must have auto updated in the last month or two, and it is now seriously inaccurate (it underestimates by a lot) for distance covered which is all I use it for. I really want to use it to measure the distance walked and don't know how to rectify it. Any suggestions? Thanks."
"The app keeps crashing when you try to start an exercise, or try to review recent exercises. It seams to be trying to display the map when it crashes. Been using it for years but now it doesn't work."
"I first tried this on my old note and then stopped using it because it only counted maybe half my steps or less, so now I got the note 9+ and figured it must of been fixed and now still only counts steps when it like too.i can literally take a dozen steps and watch it not count, I stop then walk again and nothing until like over a dozen steps in then it starts. Can somebody tell me why this is and how I can get an accurate step count"
The app is no longer connecting with my fitness pal which makes the experience less efficient. It would be really great to get this sorted so we can all have some semblance of reliable holistic tracking.
The August update removed the weight management card. I had heard this might happen and had saved a previous version just in case it actually did. Uninstall the update and reinstall the old version. Will update only if the weight management card comes back.
"It doesn't seem to be able to sync with my Fitbit, or with the Loseit app. I'm not going to log my steps (most of them are not when I'm holding my phone) or meals twice, so large parts are useless."
"Awfull. Too much permissions without any sense for application usage. Privacy is not as name says, but to make all your data public. I really do not understand how this is allowed in EU. Also paired with a watch and all recent changes around privacy makes the watch unusable if you do not want to share all data and make it public, which is illegal to be forced to do so for a product that you own already."
"Love it. Just wish they had s journaling function and tracked sugar intake on the nutrients portion. Otherwise, it is everything you need AND is just a fun interface, I especially like the monthly walking challenges."
"Nutrition balance score missing Unlike previous version, the new update doesn't show Nutrition balance score. The score helped me balance the macronutrients in each meal during the day and improve accordingly. Hopefully it gets picked up in the next update. Thanks."
"I recently got a Samsung Galaxy Fit, but this app annoying doesn't re-sync the steps after phone has been turned off and back on again. On Sunday it was telling me that I needed some steps to reach my 6k daily step target, meanwhile my watch has my 14k steps. It happened again today, this app is saying 3666 steps meanwhile my watch is saying 7552 steps. I expect when it's supposed to sync to the watch, it should know what the watch us saying. This annoys me way more than it probably should!"
"I my opinion the watch should be renamed to Promise 3. Great features was promised by samsung, but after nearly a year, still promises. The health app is ok, but lack quality, and features that actually works. I don't think the sleep patterns since day 1, has ever worked correctly. Finally the sleep oxygen was added, which also seems not be working, but Fitbit had this feature working 2 years ago for half the price. I had all the phone models from S2 until now the note 10+"
"Update ruined this app. Useless. Why the developers deleted the one function I and many others relied on, plus ruined the color scheme, who knows. This app was everything in my weight loss journey and nutrition score keeping. Without the weight management feature, it's just as mediocre as other step counter apps. Thoroughly disappointed and happy to share it with everyone I know."
"For about the past few weeks, the walking workout function stops tracking at just over 6 minutes. the steps function is working, just the walking workout function. I have rebooted several times. I am using version 6.4.0.047."
"I'm a first-time fitness app user, so I'd say this is simply amazing! Helps with weight loss targets and calorie counts, also records some exercise automatically e.g. walking, running. I would highly recommend it."
"I like this app very much for the purpose I use it. I would really appreciate it if the new version had a view history button for the weight as it does for exercise. I compare weekly and monthly weight averages much more than daily. Please, please, add."
"Last update bricked the app. Was wondering why my watch wouldn't tell me sleep info, workout data, ect. so tried to open app to learn I needed to log in again. Then just got the circle, indefinitely. Came here and followed advice recommended by samsung to previous reviewers such as clear data, clear cache. Tried that, nothing. Tried again, only this time uninstalled and restarted phone, then redownloaded. Still nothing. Incredibly inferiorating and unacceptable. Time to look at garmin I guess."
"I am crushed by this update. My weight has been tracked for years. Now have to scroll continuously to find old readings. No longer see break down , lowest, average and highest. This is terrible. This was the best app."
This bloatware should be self-contained in the wearable app. It coerces you to create a Samsung account without option to sign in with Google or Facebook or anything. It also coerces you to approve all app permissions to work instead of only providing the features for the permissions you approved. Finally it coerces you to give your phone number for two step authentication without the option to decline. Samsung should hire experienced engineers instead of using toddlers as software architects.
it keeps me motivated to keep walking and keep doing excercise. It keeps record of the distance and how many steps I take and keep upgrading my achievements.... which in return keeps my interest alive Good app...üëç . The only reason its 4 star üåü there room for improvement in everything we may get surprised by new innovation in this app....
"Recent update is horrible! Cannot even use the app, it just stays on the 2 step verification screen. Please fix this! I have to uninstall then redownload to use it, but then not allow it to update at all to use the basic features."
"I really like this app. Only if I could just figure out how exactly to hold my finger just right everytime for the stress and heart beat test, I would be all set! Happy to have a heart rate testing device at the tip of my finger at any giving time!"
"Dissapointed the latest version has removed the weekly and monthly weight trend function. These are as important, if not more important, that a basic record of daily weight. If I am to continue using this app I would need see them re-instated."
Having used the fitbit app I found this app okay and used it only because I bought Gear S3. Now it does not sync with the watch automatically. Every manual sync with the app is a pain. Please improve the app and especially the syncing with the watch issue
"This app was so helpful until they removed the weight management widget. I lost 25 lbs using it and can't find a replacement app that has similar features. Seems like they took the best part away, are they planning on making people pay for the good parts of the app?I understand people were having trouble understanding how it works but give people a chance.Its hard at first to understand how bmr, calorie deficit and exercise come together at the end of the day. It helped people learn &understand"
"Similar to previous users, I'm uninstalling this app after many years of usage due to recent privacy concerns. The updated app requires permission to make phone calls and access contacts for unconvincing reasons. Samsung's reply to these concerns was very political and didn't touch on the concern. For me, it is considered disrespectful to the consumer. In a digital world full of competition, I'll switch to another with better privacy protection."
"This was my goto app for workouts, especially for runs. Now after a few updates, my heartbeat sensor is no longer compatible with the app. After the last update, it now requests permission to access my phone and contacts?! Why? This is a health app, not a social media platform. Uninstalled...."
I'm extremely bummed that the Samsung Health App no longer has the optin to connect and sync to a Fitbit. I'm not sure why they thought it was a good idea to take it away but I really hope they bring the option back soon.
The new update has taken away the total carb count something diabetics need. Now to use the app to get a total carb you have to go thru each meal and physically add it up for those of us who physically keep a carb count with our blood sugars. Time to find a different app and hit delete on this one.
"Update: the fix sent by developers seems to be working so far. üôÇ This app has been great for a long time, but just in the last few months or hasn't been tracking my steps accurately. Frustrating!"
"I can't open the app because it keeps twlling me ""unauthorized changes have been made to your phone"" even though I haven't changed anything. Before I was also getting an error that would force the app to open to tell me about the error when I wouldn:t be using it."
"terrible. have to keep on uninstalling as it loses step count every 3 months. ridiculous thanks for the feedback, but still this doesnt work. I dont understand why the app cannot be fixed versus doing these steps, which dont even work. today I have walked 20km and the steps are saying 9k which is massively understated"
"New permissions make it unusable. Junk app now, somehow Samsung removed last review, seems fishy. Response is not great, I won't be changing my review. Please remove the requirement to access my phone, that is not required for a fitness app. Several updates, still requires phone permissions. Won't be buying a Samsung fitness device again. Worthless. Still not fixed, uninstalled and replacing watch."
Inconsistent its good as a stand alone but not very good at connecting with other apps. On my most recent run it hasnt synced to strava and hasnt created a gpx file meaning I cant export it manually either. Very frustrating. Otherwise its OK.
Stress reading not working always reads at the extreme low end since last update. Started the app and set for a cycle ride. That recorded fine. But the app also recorded me a walking over 4000 steps at the same time. If it knows I'm cycling why does it do this?
"I wish I could give it zero stars at this point. This app was working fine at first along with my watch. It would collect data on my REM sleep, my stress levels a d have detailed information. Now it's not recording any of that stuff. It won't even add on the app when I have a glass of water after entering it from my watch. Please do not tell me to call any number as I am from Trinidad and calling overseas will be very expensive. Do something about the app...fix it please."
I love all the challenges especially the global. It has been very motivated. I wish you could also add the miles to those. I know it show miles for the daily but it would be awesome to see it for the week and month or Global challenges.
"Hi, I can't access the app today. I requires me to sign in into Samsung account after agreeing to the new privacy note, but there is no place to sign in... Shall I uninstall it and install again? Also, it's totally incomprehensible why the app needs access to my calls? Some other questions: - why doesn't the list of workouts in the app and in the watch (Samsung Gear Fit) match? E.g. there's no crosscountry skiing in the watch. - why doesn't app calculate steps etc. in a non-Samsung phone?"
Bad as hell. If there were 0‚òÜ i would rank it as 0. Says leave your mobile data oppened for a better journey. Doesn't work. Leave your screen on. Doesn't work. This app needs to he fixeddd. It doesn't show the correct amount traveled!!!!
"I would have given this app 5 STARS before the update. Now I can't clearly see Carbs, fats, and protein grams. What was the point of doing that?? What happened to the Nutrient Score? What was the absolute point? You had a good thing and ruined it. We bought the phone and the app came with it. You just made it so useless. Until it is fixed, I'll have to go find some other app to help me track my macros."
"i mainly use for the steps tracking aspect. steps challenges are fun and give a new goal. water, food, caffiene, sleep logs etc are easy to use. if you want to set a goal weight and track calories in and out it tells you when you should hit your target weight"
"Rubbish not being able too synch other health apps with this, seems every other heth app will let you synch with other apps such as Google fit, but Samsung won't allow this, doesn't help the fact the app isn't recording steps corrects in a Huawei p20 pro seems too be the only step app that won't work with the phone on the market!"
I love this app. It has me step conscious. I'm not good with the calorie counting section of my meals. Wished it was simpler. Thanks to this app I have been exercising non stop. Wished there was some other way to get through to persons for a challenge. Why when I sent the snow challenge to a friend she could see my activity but I couldn't see hers?
Can't scroll down past heart rate on the main screen without the app force stopping. All menu choices above it and including it work properly; I just can't access any choices below it. Even after restart and clearing cache. OG Pixel/ Android 10
"My tracker says no steps recorded, when i can always see step count on notification panel.why so????. After update cannot slide screen to view any data.How to go back To old version. Still the same issue after this update. Everytime need to open and refresh the app for step count."
"Hello. Everything was good untill recent update. Now I cannot use this app at all. It just does not allow to enter the program. I input personal data, sign in. Then it shows loading mark which does not disappear."
This app was amazing. I used it to lose quite a bit of weight and recommended the app when people asked how I did it. But now I can't see my weight trends. That was the best feature for me in my weight loss journey. Unhappy with this change.
The app is terrible since the update. Every morning it shows that I have less steps than I had when I went to bed. I also don't like that I can no longer see how I'm doing with my calories and eating once my workouts are incorporated. Please fix this app.
"Great app, but over the last few weeks it stops tracking my runs if I get text messages. I won't notice it unless I'm constantly looking at my pace. Then I have to restart it and I lose time and distance..."
"How can so Major company create such bad app. App simply cannot be used, since you can't pass the 2FA screen - once code is entered the ""Verify"" button is grayed out xD When you try to skip, error pops out XD Horrible. No update for a while too, I'm completly locked out of my account. I`m gonna sell my samsung band and buy a Mi band instead, since I can't use this one."
"4 stars because it doesn't have a more precise timer for workouts, like seconds or something for intervals, it would be awesome if they added that too, otherwise i mostly use it for tracking sleep, water and heart rate and it works nice"
Straightforward and easy to use. I like this app a lot except recently am noticing it's slowed down considerably meaning it's frustrating trying to input data because you need to wait 5 seconds after every selection input.
"It had been working as it should lately, until about a week ago. As of October 1st, it's suddenly showing all my sleep to be restless once again. I don't know why that keeps happening, but maybe that should be an area you double check before releasing an update. 4/14/2021- I knocked your rating down another 2 stars. Not only is the app STILL not recording sleep data properly, but this new update requires the app to have permission to make and manage phone calls??? Why is this necessary??"
"Changed my previous 3 star review after the update that removed entirely the most useful feature of this app, weight and kcal tracking. I used them daily and had tons of personal food data stored. At this point I'll just uninstall the app. Very disappointed with samsung for this."
"Really enjoying the loading circle that seems to be the only content of this app. After logging in, that's all that happens on my oneplus 7t. reinstalling, restarting phone did not fix it. Hope it gets fixed until sync with other fitness apps gets disabled .."
I love this app and would have given it 5 stars. The reason I haven't is that following an update a few months back steps and distance tracked are all lumped into one amount and not separate episodes during the day. Before the update I could see how much walking/cals achieved in the morning and then again in the afternoon and also a total for the day. Please can you guys at Samsung think about improving this function in your next update and it will then be a 5 star rating and beats other apps.
"Used this for a couple of years now and couldn't fault the app until now. For some unknown reason despite counting my steps for the past two days, after midnight they have been wiped showing no record of usage whatsoever. Nearly 28k steps lost from my weekly average"
"Bring back the weight management functionality. The reason i bought samsung phones is to have that management app. I've been loyal to samsung brands when it comes to phones, tablets, appliances and wearables. Now, removing the weight management functionality is like losing the sole purpose of buying sumsung phones at smart watches."
"New update awhile ago, changed the food portion of the app so it takes more steps to log your meals. Now another update still more steps to log meals & you can only choose from ALL, RECENT & CUSTOM; FAVORITES is gone. Instead of making app easier its more complicated & confusing. My spouse is frustrated, so not to using app any more."
Been using for 3yrs. Dont think I'll use any other. Fiance bought me HR fit watch. Syncing is seamless. Love the new streamlined version. Accessible and user friendly. Did not take long to relearn. But can they add ALL MY MARATHON TOTAL DISTANCE next to my expert level so all can see and put some respect on meüôÉ. Cant wait to make expert level 50!
"I would like to see better integration with MyFitnessPal. Currently the app is very slow to sync workout data and also, there's no way to sync step data, which seems somewhat absurd to me."
"This is a good app if used with a Samsung gear watch or fitness band. But the app on phone doesn't monitor health parameter itself, so, I loose on my workout monitoring of I am not wearing gear watch. I guess the app may be working on Samsung phone but I have a Xiaomi phone. If they can resolve this, the app will become five star quality. Also, while logging meals it does not have most of the Indians food options. Food logging is only beneficial if you are logging typical western cuisine."
"My phone keeps notifying me that this app is draining the battery, asking if I want to Force Stop it. Which I do, my battery is way more important. I like this app, but I like using my phone, and batteries only have a limited amount of lifetime charge. This makes my Samsung smartwatch particularly useless for anything but telling the time If I knew this I would have saved $200 and got a regular watch, and just kept a separate pedometer on my belt."
"Redesign is horrible, seems like you have to scroll for an hour to find what you want. Previous design was perfect, everything at your fingertips. CHANGE IT BACK!"
"Another preloaded app that started awesome, and is now going to be rolled back to the original version to restore the only two features that made it useful. EDIT: Cool, Stress Measure includes SpO2, except that I'm in Canada, and its not available. EDIT2: Bought a CATEYE ant+ HRM. Big surprise, doesnt work with Samsung Health. Guess this is going back to the bin."
Ever since i got my phone i have discovered this app and i use it everyday ! I keep track of my food intake and my daily exercise ! I have succeeded into loosing way more weight than i ever expected. And i would recommend it to my friends. Edit: on the new upgrade they removed the most important feature ! The weight managment feature is now gone ! How am i supposed to know if i'm over or under ?? Bring it back ! We need it.
I liked the app but I can't transfer data from my old phone. The help says to use options that don't exist to backup and restore. Sync doesn't work. So I've lost 3 year's worth of history.
Why can't I delete foods that I've added anymore!? I love this app and use it everyday to track my meals and activity. I used to be able to delete foods that I've manually added to make room for different things since you can only add 100 items but now it won't last me delete anything! The 100 item cap isn't a big deal if I can delete items but now that I can't this app is pretty much dead to me as a food tracker. Please fix this!
"This is a good app, I use it daily. It used to sync with MyFitnessPal, but it no longer does, and it hasn't for quite some time. If it was possible to sync with MyFitnessPal again, I would definitely give this app 5 stars."
The app is good but there is no option to add gym classes such as spin class to your exercise record. There's also no option to include weighted kit such as weighted backpacks/belts or ankle/wrist weights to the hiking and walking exercises. This means the calories burned for these sessions is wildly inaccurate because it doesn't measure the additional weighted equipment carried.
"Used to be buggy. To their credit they've fixed a lot of the things I used to complain about. Things that are great about this app now are the treadmill, exercise bike, walking, and addable exercises that is like a top 4 that you can start on the fly. And the autostart walking sensor is quicker to respond. Do they still have more work to do? Sure! But it looks to me like they're actually working on improving the product."
"This app come with all galaxy phones, but I love it! Best health app I have ever used. It has everything to help track every aspect of health. I've compared it to fitbit and google fit, and this one by far is better when it come to tracking fitness."
edit : i just recieved a notice from samsung saying that starting this july 6.11 update there won't be weight management feature and caffeine tracking. like seriously samsung??? first the community feature and now this. honest review i highly appreciate the weight management feature cz it helped me lose 15kg in 3 months and it helped me a lot with my diet management. removing the features is just like putting the app into an unbalance where the greatest feature is not available anymore.
"I brought the galaxy watch active 2 yesterday, the step count can not be calculated separated from your phone. Which gives a incorrect count, so completely defeats the purpose of the step count if you cant get an accurate count.had i known this prior to buying the watch i would never had brought it. You also cant add foods or products through the app, to manage food intake."
"New update is still horrible. Bring back the option to see weekly and monthly weight trends in the chart that records weight. Still not fixed in the new update. I recommend the App ""Weight Loss Tracker & BMI Calculator- WeightFit"" for those frustrated with Samsung."
"Loved it until you stopped third party programs being able to import your step count. My tracker isn't a Samsung so now this app is useless. You can't let me put my step count in manually either. Bloatware now! And your response is only helpful if the number was available in my country. Not everyone is in the USA, let alone the northern hemisphere! Ugh!"
Feeling very frustrated...... I don't understand why it will only show a weekly average. I would like to see the weekly total distance and weekly total steps but this information is not available. I actually replaced my fitbit for my galaxy watch but I'm now beginning to regret it.
After the last update my phone is no longer compatible with my watch. Even though I've had the watch for over a year and my phone has all the specs but not the correct model. I have an LG g7 and i was told that it's not a compatible phone model. Please fix update so my watch works correctly again.
"I am a user of Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 and Galaxy S10 lite. Whenever I am joing a fittness programe, the watch is not counting the time and calories as well as on my phone also, the calories burnt and heart rate option is not showing. Everytime, I have to uninstall and install the Samsung health app to make it work. But after completing one session of a program, the same problem is again prevailing. So everytime I start a workout, I have to uninstall and then install this app. Plz fix."
"I hope you guys bring back the weight management, it was a great feature, not just for me but for a lot of us. This app had all in one, where we didn't have to download different apps. Please bring it back & I will change to 5 stars."
"I've been using this app for years and overall have had no issues with it. However, currently I am unable to manually enter a workout if I forget to start it on my watch. Am I just overlooking how to do this with the new update or has that feature been taken away? If so, bringing that feature back would be great."
"Can you please add the ability to sync to Google Fit? That'll automatically make it a five star rated app for me. As it is, the app is really useful to me. Both functional and aesthetically pleasing. UI/UX is smooth. Also, improve the Samsung account sign in process...make it a bit easier. Thanks for your work. May my God bless you devs"
I wish it was a little more intuitive. It's difficult to adjust sleep times and doesn't rate waking distance as accurate as I would like without the help of additional gear.
"This is the worst thing to run with. It is completely innacurate when describing duration. I ran a 400 (on a track), 3.5x before it counted a single mile. The most demotivating thing ever. Fastest mile i can currently do is 5:30, according to this it's 7 minutes. Unbelievable."
I dont know what did samsung do with the recent updates but i can no longer sync with my AIA vitality app. This is very frustrating. It kept saying samsung health is not granting data permission. I switched it on but it doesnt work.
"If I could give it zero stars I would. Can't login which is frustrating. I've tried the steps to remove cache etc, reinstall, restart but it's made no difference. Very disappointing as it makes my new watch fairly pointless."
"The last update was really bad and this one is even worse. How can you do this to people who depend on it ? It was great at first. Now you can't log the snacks at the right time, you can't see the nutrients add up...very disappointing, it used the be the greatest free app."
"I love this app, but sleep detection works strange with my Galaxy Watch 4. It shows sleep time correctly, but sleep stages are all at zero level. Sometimes it shows correctly, sometimes not. Can't understand what am I doing wrong. It works fine on my Watch app."
One of the best fitness apps I've ever used in my life. One problem is though that when you record your sleeping hours you always have to round off on the time which I don't like at all hopefully that get's fixed other then that it's great.
For years is was good. Their last update added two permissions to use the app but would not allow me to do anything. Not even add the two permissions which in my opinion is not needed. I uninstalled it and reinstalled and still couldn't get in to the app.
"It's a useful app. I enjoyed the food tracking except I'm trying to gain weight and I need 3,400 calories. App only allows 2,700. I switched to MyFitnessPal. The speedometer is wacky. Tells me my current pace is 56-minutes/mile, then it says my average is 17-minutes/mile. Samsung needs to tweek their algorithms ASAP. I love the workout options and can't wait to get off my lazy-ass and start using them."
tracking steps better. path on map not accurate; it cuts off the corners thus reducing mileage. that feature is better if you create a session. can't find my husband to be my friend on the group challenge.
"I am seriously annoyed. I spent $300 on a watch and the app doesn't work. I can't sign in. My husband can't sign in. Found a similar response and followed the ""fix"" didn't work. Not going to call, as the ""fix"" didn't work. So don't suggest calling. They can't load into your phone for you. üôÑüôÑ IMO it is a waste of money. Can't even rate the actual app because it won't let me log in."
"I loved the app the way it was. Now, not only is all my past data gone it won't sink with my Samsung watch. Disappointed and want it back the way it was. It was more functional, useful and user friendly before the update."
Nice app. Interface is attractive. The only issue I faced was when two family members used same email ID. Data was recorded from two trackers and combined result was shown on both phones. It become a mess until we used separate email IDs.
"I used to love this app. Now it's saying my phone was rooted/unauthorized changes were made (which isn't true) so the app can no longer open. I uninstalled it, cleared data, force stopped it. Everything, but nothing works."
"The new update doesn't work. Never had a problem with the app until this last update. After the update, apparently I have died since I have no heart rate and no steps recorded since the update. This would also explain no sleep record since the dead don't sleep."
The response below mustn't move you. DON'T BOTHER TO DOWNLOAD. it only exites you for a second before it fails you. 1 week and 2 reinstallations later. Programs still Freeze and some download upto 10% then cancel. USELESS APP. I dont know why Vitality chose to partner with such inefficiency
I've been using this app for quite a while. It has helped with tracking my calorie and nutritional intake. But it just updated and suddenly the app wanted me to sign up again and then give permission to my phone contacts! This is unacceptable! I uninstalled it and am looking for a new health app that doesn't expect more than the information I intend to give.
Have uninstalled and reinstalled app continuing to have issues with it tracking steps. I have went into settings and verified steps are tracking through mobile and still not having any luck getting it to track. After following steps of troubleshooting provided issue has been resolved. Thank you Samsung ü•∞
"I love it! You can set your target for exercise, diet, sleeping etc. Obviously having a watch unlocks alot more of the features of this app. However, even just your üì± has plenty to positively change your diet or exercising."
"Lack of configuration options, horrible UI. It's also possible to delete your entire food entries for a single meal by accident if you discard your changes. Doesn't sync with non-Samsung devices."
"I've recently bought a new phone Samsung M31, only to find that my Samsung gear fit pro wearable is not compatible! Having fairly recently replaced the watch I'm very disappointed, so now I've had to buy a Samsung galaxy fit wearable. The problem I now have is that it doesn't count the floors, OK I should have checked that before I bought it, but then surely my phone should still do that, but the floors option has disappeared from the app. Is that something that was in the latest update?"
"Was using some of the basics until it last updated. Now I can't stand it, and have deleted it. It shouldn't take 20 minutes to try to get access to my data that it has been tracking for years with the previous version. I'll be looking for a new app that is user friendly, as this one no longer is."
"Been using apps to track blood sugar for a couple of years and liked how I could look at and graph daily, weekly or monthly trends with ease. Thats now gone with latest update. Going to have to look for another app."
I use to love the application until the latest software update in Jan 2019 . Can't compare between dates . I'm not receiving notification for walking more than the target which is 60 minutes. üò¢üò¢ I think that you should have kept the main pages that we got used to it instead of changing the whole thing . - Thanks for responding & I hope you understood what I meant . cheers
"I am new to this app. When I agreed to all the terms and condition, the app couldnt proceed to the next stage. The apps showed an error occurred. I tried once again afer cleaning the data but it still showed an error."
"It's ridiculous that Samsung devices run on Andriod, but Samsung Health and Google Fit do not sync. That makes zero sense. You would think that it would be a no brainer that they would easily sync so users don't need to use third party apps. It's poor logic like this that explains why people *think* Apple is easier."
"This app was fantastic for a few months, but this last update has caused me to decide to delete the app. It has began to send sexually explicit content to not only my phone but my child's phone...and I can't seem to get any answers when I email the email listed so I'll post a review!"
"Extremely inaccurate for watches, especially with moving and sleeping. I thought maybe dysfunctional watch and got a replacement but it still often tells me I should get moving when I've been constantly moving at work. Also tells me I'm sleeping when really awake and waking up many times throughout the night when I'm not"
"4/18/19-The app stopped counting my steps. I've restarted my phone and uninstalled/reinstalled the app and nothing has changed. I would give this app 5‚òÜ is someone could tell me how to fix the step counter. 4/19/19-I received a message from the developer on how to reset the pedometer and it is working great again, upgraded the rating to 5‚òÜ. Thank you."
"Thanks for adding new feature: Woman's health. It is really important. Could you also add into this feature one more little improvement? I think, there shoud be added button or something similar for creating a list with all logs, it will be better than scrolling whole calendar for find one note"
I had to switch out of my Samsung Note 9 recently to a non Samsung phone. Downloaded this app for my Samsung active 2 watch which I still have and it doesn't work with my phone. Freezes right after login. It's irritating. Hopefully it can be fixed cause idk how long I'll be with this new phone.
I had a Fitbit for many years. I was worried about changing to another activity watch because of the ap. I am so glad I made the switch! I couldn't be happier! It always synces with my LG Stylo and the information is accurate!
"Sleep function was no longer displaying details in chart & graph. I followed the instructions that Samsung provided to another user (clear cache, force stop, restart phone) and this fixed the issue, and I'm back to loving this app again!"
Great app and fun to use. Non intrusive but still encourages you to push and do more. will definitely lose weight if you're consistent enough. only snag is some difficulty in recording calorie intake.
"I truly find this to be a great way to keep track of exercises and weight loss. The step counter however needs to be adjustable, or some way to calibrate steps. On the S9 it is counting more steps than taken."
"I'm so disappointed!! This app was brilliant and had everything. Since the update, everything has gone. Bring back what you've taken off the app and I would definitely give it 5 stars. This is so frustrating after trying everything to get them back on to then read on the reviews that you have actually removed them! I will be downloading another app now so I get the heart rate, oxygen levels etc and not using this one until its back to how it used to be!"
"Would like if it had extra widgets to choose, like one for challenges or weekly numbers, active minutes. The stress bar doesn't have the measure button, looked at settings nothing,not sure why it exist if it's useless."
After the last update I can't even login to the app. It asks me to set up two step verification and then won't let me verify. When I try to skip the setup I get an error and get kicked back to the login screen.üò°
"This app has a bug that renders it unusable. It asks you to do 2 step verification but goes in a looped bug, where you can never get past that, so you never get past the setup to use the app."
"Cant open it anymore. It prompts me to enable two factor authentication, which then asks for my phone number, which then sends me back to the previous screen. Repeat cycle forever. It's been like this for sever days even after updating everything."
"I loved this app until the latest update. I don't use the ""together"" feature, so the app doesn't need permissions to my phone contacts. Unfortunately I will no longer be using this app which I have used for years. I'm very disappointed in Samsung for this change."
"Covers everything and runs smoothly. Constructive criticism- Thing is if you're going to add a feature to tag different bpms, either add an other option we can fill in or add an anxiety tag. Sometimes my watch thinks I'm working out when I'm walking and anxious."
"If I could give this app a minus rating, I would. It will not work at all. There are no ""measure"" buttons to press for heart rate, blood pressure etc, only record buttons and it takes you to a screen to enter the details manually. That's not the way it's supposed to work."
"One of the main reasons I got this phone was for Bixby and my ability to easily track my heart rate and oxygen levels. This came in so handy during my last pregnancy, and is really needed with this one. Had I known I would need my watch all the time for this, I probably would have just kept my S8. Maybe I'm missing it. Idk. But rn I'm pretty disappointed and having buyer's remorse. üôÉüôÉ"
"For years I've used Samsung Health multiple times daily with my Galaxy 6. Recently updated to new S20+. Very disappointed with Samsung Health on new phone. Both the stress and oxygen saturation are there, but absolutely no way to measure. These are two of the features I used up to several times a day. What's the deal?"
"Sync is totally unreliable. Eg 7000 steps on watch, after syncing the app says 1500. No errors reported in sync but the totals are completely wrong. I have to give up on monthly challenges because my actual steps aren't even tallied."
"This app keep crashing. When I try to open this app and click agree for privacy policy, it can't to start and keep loading. I've been waiting for a long time, but it keeps loading. Please, fix this bug!"
Updated Samsung health 3 days ago now it does not sync my sleep data from galaxy fit were as it worked fine before update...?so got it working again and after 8 months back to sleep data not syncing again..heart rate set to continuous...have cleared cache so will see if that helps in the morning.ok after clearing Samsung health cache and gear app cache I have my sleep data again...heart rate data through the night not syncing since last SH update though.
"After years of using this app, i deleted due to new requirement to manage my calls. Really could not understand the mandatory agreement. Too bad! I diwnloaded another one. Thanks for the great years, i ran hundred of kms with my Samsung buddy, time to move on !"
Great that it records every aspect of lifestyle in one app without ads. Definitely need a barcode scanner for food. It dies feel like recording lots of data without generating any insights; food recommendations like Lifesum would be great.
"Earlier this week I received an update notification for my Samsung Health app. I did the update, and when I went to access the app, I had to log in (??). That was new, never happened before, not on my current or previous devices. I don't know why all of a sudden it is NOW. I created a login linked up to my Google account, and it's been a nightmare ever since. Now other apps are asking for permission to my contacts and phone in order to sync. Uh why and nope, denied. Buh-bye Samsung Health app üëã"
"I wanted to sync my Galaxy watch 3 with this but I can't login from OnePlus 6T. Tried deleting tha app and reinstalling it several times. No solution. I guess Samsung is just forcing you to buy its phone for this. Update: Your reply does not help samsung!! Try searching on Google, hundreds of people are facing the same issue."
I wanted an app that would help me track everything. I have had Samsung phones for years but never used the apps to their full extent. I started tracking my Food about 2 weeks ago because I needed to get back to Journaling. Its the only way I can lose weight or maintain my weight. This app does it all!! I don't need to check out any others. **Update - 5/24/21- I am down 15lbs thanks to Samsung Health and daily tracking. It also records my Renpho scale. I love this app!
"Very disappointing üò° after an update app wants me to log in, which was not the case before and after signing in qith google account, it still wants to have a 2 way authentication. Seriousely? It is just a health app. So for some reason this app wants to know everythings about me and my contact and keep sending me spam ads. I used to like it before, but seems i need to find another app with less hunger for my personal data..."
Wondering why after buying an s10 theres ads in this app along with most of the Samsung apps. Why am I getting ads I this app? Just got a Netflix ad and a blue cross blue shield ad in THIS ap. Samsung health. before writing this review. Ive seen others get a reply from samsung saying this app doesn't have ads. It does. Along with other samsung aps. Theres literaly news articles about this.
After the update on 8/29 the app won't sync to my Go365 or Myfitnesspal. Greatly disappointed that there seems to be an issue the company hasn't fixed. Unless it can sync and stayed synced this is a completely useless app.
Seemed to he working alright since installed (end Feb 2021). BUT for last 2 nights (3/10 & 4/10) NO SLEEP GRAPH appears. There is a Sleep score given tho. So no graph means no breakdown of Sleep Stages. However on the watch all the data is there! What is going on??
"The new menu is better, but why are there ads in this app? I paid for your hardware, I should not have to have ads! Edit: Switched to one star. Developer says there are no ads, yet I have a big ad at the top for a Galaxy Watch Active 2, Blue Apron, and more."
"The app is always open, always drawing power and yet it does not work. I am on my feet all day but not a step is covered unless i go into the app, pause the steps then turn them back on. Updating has not helped. I do not recommend this app."
I loved the app for tracking steps and sleep. But recently something change in sleep tracker. My sleep hasn't changed but the sleep scoring has drasticallychanged. Also if I wake up in the middle of the night it separates the sleep. Frustrating...
"I love how it keeps me motivated! The only thing I would suggest is to add 1/4 serving sizes under the meal tracker section, it would make easier to track home cooked meals more accurately. Other than that I all around love it!"
App is great for tracking steps etc but would rate better if could sync to apps like steidekick. Google fit steps vs Samsung health is completely different. And I use stridekick app with colleagues and family in challenges month to month. Samsung health needs should give them permission to use to sync data to app
"Used this app daily but now I MUST use 2 factor authentication. No way to skip. Aggravating, when I get the code and type it in, the (verify) button stays Grey and isn't clickable. So now after uninstalling and reinstalling all I have is a headache. Made it so frustrating I realized I don't need this app. Oh and just try to submit a question, can't even choose Samsung health as a topic. Have to gather so much information about phone just to ask a question. Might miss it for a second. Maybe."
"As of This October 1st my sleep partner at night isn't being recorded ONLY naps. I have I have I have uninstalled and reinstalled the app, which I loose my step count. I'm able to see my total sleep pattern on my galaxy watch. Only thing dislike is about 200 calories already counted for the day before even starting the day... I am now having issues with the step counter. I have lost 4-5 days of steps including calories are off. I've called support and done what was advised with no luck."
"sync with other apps (runkeeper, gear fit, and google fit) keeps getting worse. gps cuts and and says ive used 5 steps for a 2 mile run logged with the kinked samsung watch.. tried suoport help but after 15 messages back and forth gave up they are not helping or have any intention to make app compatibility better"
"Since the last update this app wants to read your phone ID, contacts, make phone calls and who knows what. This app seems to be shady and poses huge security issue for me. Verdict: AVOID. No samsung, I don't want to share my sensitive data to have - as you call it - optimal experience."
"Love it, keeps me going, I watch what I eat. I enjoy the challenge that you have every month, especially when you have people running or walking or horse riding with you, actually so many things to choose. I will definitely recommend this app....."
"Will uninstall this app. You Do NOT need access to my phone or contacts for what this app is supposed to do and I will not grant access to that information. I don't want ""Samsung health together"". Please FIX THIS App! It used to work without ""phone"" access and now it doesn't. You failed at providing ""an optimal experience"". You did anger a lot of soon-to-be previous customers. The fact that you send everyone the same canned answer proves you don't understand how big an issue this is."
as a 6 foot 2 280 pound teenager. this definitely helps me keep track of everything I do. every week I lose atleast 3 pounds and gain it back in muscle. and this really gives me something to work towards. I definitely suggest this app to anyone wanting to add some fun to their workout.
"They removed the most important feature in the latest update - trends. Now you can longer see your data grouped by weeks, months, average, etc. Just a timeline of days. Time to find an app that is committed to helping with health."
** Edit- Customer service line was amazing! quick to answer quick to solve my issue! I'm so happy to get my app working again! I love this app. However my phone (galaxy s 8) did a system update this morning and it is no longer counting my steps. Can you advise me on how to fix it? I have looked at everything and cannot figure it out.
I like the app to track my activity. I was told that the challenges help you earn points and such to go towards accessories. For example a Samsung Galaxy smartwatch. That would be cool if that were true. I have been wanting one but those things are expensive
I used to rely on this app...only needed to count my steps. With the latest update the 'Privacy policy' is anything but private. I WILL NEVER agree to my data being shared. They don't even say how they will store highly confidential data. Absolute rubbish.
"WHY?! Why would you remove the weight management feature? It was the best thing about the app, and I'm sure a feature that most users valued. Absolutely mind boggling that you would remove it. Consequently, the app has gone from being unequivocally better than Fitbit, Google fit etc to being somewhere in the pack. Please reinstate the feature."
"**update** Thank you for updating the app to include the macronutrient count for the day. I very much appreciate your consideration! The new update has removed everything I loved about the app. As a PT, I made all my clients use it to keep track of their calories and macronutrients by number. As you have removed them, this app is unusable for tracking food properly. This is extremely disappointing. Can you please bring back numbers in the next update?"
"Useful app but the Jan 2021 update is ugly and removes useful features (eg weekly average weight, week and month views). It's a small thing but the animation on the numbers for weight is irritating too - I'd much rather it just show the number, not flicker every time."
"Tried to open the app this week. It said it doesn't work with a rooted phone (mine isn't). Now it will randomly pop up out or the blue to tell me that, even though I'm not in the app. it'll keep doing that every 5-10 seconds until i force stop it. I uninstalled just to get it to leave me alone."
"Always been a fan of Samsung products, but not impressed with their health app. Would be nice if they added a bar code scanner to the calorie tracker...that's pretty much standard on all other comparable fittness apps... get with the times Samsung."
"While I enjoy the functionality of the app greatly, and use it several times a day, it is extremely disencouraging that hundreds or maybe thousands of people cheat in the global challenge, and nothing is done about it. You cannot even report a user for cheating, only ""Fake picture"", ""Inappropriate picture"" and ""Inappropriate name"". It was the same when I participated in my first global challenge more than a year ago, and nothing has changed, it's even some of the same users as back then."
Very help full app. Tracks every health related issues. One issue is in water drinking it would be better if the app is with notification or reminder about water drinking so that it will avoid unneccessary installing of other drinking tracking ups.
"Samsung really messed up on this one, if the last couple of years didn't show you how important Privacy is than you need a serious lesson. Why would I allow a health app permission to things it don't need to track stats from my watch... Give us the option to opt in/out! Speaking from someone in Cybersecurity, you need to re-evaluate this. Response to Samsung: the best thing for this app to do is have those permissions optional...you telling me it is not used mean nothing. It worked fine before."
"BEWARE: I loved this app, for 3 months, then, all of a sudden, in the MIDDLE of a workout, it starts asking me questions, agreements for permissions, like as though I had just downloaded the thing!! So, I stopped my workout, slammed through the questions, only to have it start my count over, after I had done 2 miles that I knew of and was going for 3.5. TOTALLY DERANGED to have this happen in the MIDDLE of a workout."
I've used this app for several years and was very happy with it until the recent update. Now it requires me to login but doesn't recognize my email or password. Uninstalled and reinstalled no change. Very dissatisfied and disappointed with this change.
This app worked great until the most recent update. Now it longer connects to my fitness app and when you try to reconnect the entire Samsung Health app crashes. Very frustrating & if not resolved soon I will have to look for a similar app to replace this one to continue tracking my progress.
"It does not automatically record your steps and I'm sure it's supposed to. I like the period tracker, weight, sleep monitor etc. Shame the pedometer doesn't work. I've had to download another app just to count my steps."
I get an error message every time I open the app. It says Samsung experience ser... Keeps stopping. I got the Samsung activity watch because my other brand I am not naming. Quite responding. I can say I am a little disappointed in my new tracker also. That cost to much to disappoint.
Update now requires permission to make phone calls? No thanks. Uninstalling. I don't care what you use the permissions for. There is no need for phone call permissions. Am no longer using. The only apps that need those permissions are communication apps.
Use to love this app until I installed the latest update and now everytime I try to to record a mileage for a walk the app just keeps crashing even after forcing a stop to the app and clearing cache. Looks like I'm going to have to uninstall and get myself a Fitbit as this is useless!!!
"It is beyond absurd that the ""samsung health monitor"" is exclusive to Samsung smartphone owners. Because I have a different android phone, I am not allowed to enjoy the ecg or blood pressure feature of their smartwatch. Samsung ispicking and choosing which features are available to you based on your allegiance to Samsung products. Whole new level of nonsense. I look forward to a different smartwatch developer releasing the blood glucose feature so I can forever walk away from this silly company."
"I used to love this app but recent UX and design changes have taken it significantly backwards. ""Cute colours"" has been allowed to win over usability, data and functionality. Pity. Maybe later versions will improve."
Loved this app but but can't stand it any longer. Locked out because I wouldn't give access to contacts. You don't need the access since I don't want any of the features the permissions would permit. Don't waste the space with your bot response. We read it many times already
"Used to work flawlessly. Now they force you to sign in and give permissions. Sad that your own samsung phone can't even track steps and save locally. I'd suggest giving your users options like offline logging. Till then, this app is going into the trash."
This is a pretty good activity and health tracker. I wish the sleep tracker allowed for a secondary criteria to specify how easy/hard it was to wake up. Gauging sleep effectiveness of pretty hard but how was my wake up? That is pretty easy and less subjective. Both are useful though.
Permission to make phone calls just to open the app? Under no circumstances! This used to be a decent app when paired with a suitable watch. Unless something changes I will have to look for another watch to track my exercises.
"I used to like this app only because of its weight recording. After the update today, I can no longer see weekly and monthly body weight change which were very useful. You can monitor your weight change only daily now. Very disappointed..."
This USED to be a really good app. Now though it's starting to suck balls üòî. There taking away features that they had and also now my step counter doesn't sync with my fitness pal app I use. I contacted Samsung Health and basically they told me to do all the things I already did and nothing more. I'm getting disappointed with it now. Also they just updated the look of the app and it sucks üëπüñìüñïüî•üí©.
"It can't measure. I do a regular run of 4.2km which is a straight line to the end of the road and back. This app records it as 5.3km, 5.6km or anything else in between. Seems to be another crappy Samsung app that should be excellent but fails in the most basic way, a bit like Bixby."
"I absolutely love my health app! It helps me keep track of all my fitness activity with so many statistics I can use to monitor my progress. The ""Together"" section is a great way to be competitive with friends and family."
"What happened to the oxygen sensor, the heart rate monitor and the stress measurements that the Samsung Health app had on my Note 8? I just started using a new Note 10 and when I went to the Samsung Health app all these functions were not to be found???? And the app now has advertisements. This has really made me very disappointed with Samsung. I should have gone with Apple. Fix this app Samsung!!!!! UPDATE: I can't turn on measure multiple because there is no stress tracker. I am in Australia."
"I have been using the app for almost 2 years, but the past few days have me looking for a new app. I am current on all applications and the Samsung phone app will not sync steps from my Samsung gear fit. Very disappointed in application readiness testing."
No longer adjusts calories available based on weight loss goal and calories burned. Food only tracks a static calorie target which is not nearly as useful as it was before. This functionally was the only real benefit of the app before.
"Love this app! But i find it highly annoying that when i missed a day with an exercise program i can't do it the next day, i have to do the whole program again.. I wish it would let me alter the days of a program to my liking so it would actually fit into my routine. That way i can decide what day is a rest day and follow multiple programs at the same time."
It used to be a great app geared to a single user and you were not pushed to give phone permission etc. I will delete it from my phone as I do not want extra access to my phone and photo data etc. Why has such a great app been turned into a data gathering tool for Samsung.
Works great but for some reason it stopped adding my exercises over to myfitnesspal. I have disconnected and reconnected and its not working. Im not sure if its on this end or the other. I would really like to continue having the 2 communicate.
"The app recently updated so I'm hoping this is just an easily fixed glitch. I went on an hour long walk this morning and tracked my workout which told me that I walked 7,637 steps...I didn't get credit for a single one of them on my daily step counter. I went on my walk and that's what matters...but I'm so close to being in the top 10% of the monthly challenge that I'm pretty upset that I'm not getting credit for my steps with three days left to go. I feel cheated."
New update is useless. I had been using this to track my steps and heart rate same time. These features are no more. And just to sell its accessories removing these features are short sighted strategy samsung adopted. I will go away with samsung altogether and turn to other phones and devices not time.
"Was great until a recent update. Now I can't track my calorie intake because it just keeps freezing up! It was nice to add an option for a morning, afternoon, and evening snack but it's no help if it's not functional!"
"Works great now. Rarely has bugs, but no way to access data without going thru the app when there is bugs. Welp, back to 3 stars. App crashes whenever trying to change the date on blood glucose."
With the latest update this app now wants access to my phone calls -why? That is completely unacceptable. It will not open unless I accept terms. I use this app primarily to keep track of my bloodsugar readings and steps each day. I prefer this app for those tasks since it is uncomplicated. Please fix! I don't want to have to uninstall.
"I used to love this app. Now? Not so much. Whatever updates where done to accommodate the Galaxy 4 watches now ( I have an Active 2 ) & Galaxy s20+ but now the sleep tracker doesn't provide the graph of awake, REM, light, and deep sleep anymore and it doesn't provide the breakdown of how long in each cycle anymore either. This app used to be very helpful with working with my Healthcare team with my sleep tracking, now it's almost useless. All app components UTD get a patch together please 2 fix"
"Maybe samsung should just focus on making devices. I was using this app for only using checking my hearth rate with the sensors and the app was not great at all. But now, it doesnt even work. It asks permissions that i will never agree. It has optional choises to start app and i choose none. Obviously just like forcing bixby on users this is another disaster. One more thing like this an my next phone will not be a samsung device."
With this new update being able to keep track of calories and how much I've burned is harder and before this feature was so helpful. With out this feature I've moved on to another app. Bring back the calories tracker and ill be back
"I used to love this app until I updated my cellphone software and it stopped counting my steps! Everything is turned on, all the permits included, and i cant figure out why it doesn't keep up with my steps! It does work when I am IN the app, but not when my cel is in my pocket and I'm not using it. Quite disappointed tho."
"Used to be very good but ever since the update, it stops counting my steps several times a day. The only way to fix it is to restart the phone, but then it happens again 10 minutes later. The update rendered this app useless."
"useful for pulse oximetry on some phones. Supposedly I can use this with my Galaxy Watch (active 2) for a simple EKG but despite downloading the update and synchronization with watch and phone, it just isn't happening. I am disappointed."
"Bring back the weight management feature! This is ridiculous, I have been diligently using this feature every day for the last year only to have it yanked out from under me only halfway through my goal! Not happy, bring it back!"
i would not recommend this app. main issue I have noticed is workout detection. when I walk for 30 mins.. this app is detecting and recording only 17 or 18 mins some times.. I also use other fitness apps on the same phone and did not find any such issue with them.
Well I had it. It updated and I deleted it over all the ridiculous permissions needed. I tried other apps. They sucked or used too uch battery. So I downloaded this again and it seems to need more personal information than before. So guess what? Delete. Delete. Delete. I really don't need to know how.many steps I take in a day. And I definitely don't need everyone else on my contacts list to know as well.
This was an awesome app till the latest update. I used the Oxygen Saturation sensor to track my oxygen levels since I'm on oxygen and now all that data is lost and now I have to track via the stress track which isn't as accurate. Please put the O2 on it's own again. I enjoy being able to keep track of my health all in one place since I'm Handicapped and this app normally helps me achieve that.
"Ok for the past few days or possibly a few weeks, I haven't been able to track any of my steps or anything else. I even uninstalled it and then reinstalled it thinking that it would reset! However, that failed and so in order for me to do that, I've got to use my watch. I used to like this app but now I definitely despise it 100%! Samsung, do your freaking job and fix this app especially since majority of these views are 1 star with lots of bad views. Btw, if I could give zero stars, I would."
"I have a new Samsung phone and it adds thousands of steps. Evidently, it's also adding the steps from my husband's Samsung watch as well. It's set to only get information from my watch. Everything else seems to be fine. Overall I like this app, but the step tracking is useless."
"I don't want to call you, YOU SHOULD IMPLEMENT NEW FEATURES, read carefully what i wrote. ADD SKATEBOARD, ADD TRICEPS PUSHUPS, ADD SOULDER PRESS ETC. in Exercises. ADD counting repeats settings in certain exercises, example i want to set XX repeats with XX times with XX second pause for exercise. ALSO check heart rate of the connected sensors even when I finish the workout. Your mf, ""prefer not to say"" etc is obviously most important thing to fix!!!"
I just purchased a Samsung and I can't even get passed the green agree button. I have allowed most of the permissions it wants but it keeps telling me to go to settings. A fitness app does not need access to my contacts and does not need to manage my calls.
"I was contemplating getting a samsung fit or a fitbit. I got the samsung fit simply because I liked the layout of samsung health app. (I have a note 10) I am happy to say that I am extremely please with both. The only addition that I would like is a scanner to scan foods. I know I can search foods, but that would be one step simpler."
"Not having the oxygen and heart rate sensor on the newer phones makes this app worthless, to me personally. There are other apps that I can use, who's layouts I prefer, to keep track of this information. I've ALWAYS been a Samsung fan but this s21 ultra is making me rethink if I want to give iPhone a chance."
"I upgraded my phone to the Samsung S21 thinking it had the health in it. Not everyone can exercise Samsung I have multiple sclerosis however I do house work and cook also walk a bit. My heart rate is out of sink and I use the app for my heart rate, oxygen and both now I have to buy another app. I don't like your watch I wear a skagen falster 3 compatible with my phone. I should have waited and bought an iPhone. Very disappointed with Samsung products my last phone caught fire S9 üëé."
"I liked the original version, but hate the so-called upgrade. It provides less information and no longer tracks the amount of time spent walking. It would have been nice to maintain some consistency with the original version to compare apples to apples, so to speak, over time."
"Hello Samsung Health, I have a problem recently syncing my samsung charm data with the app. It seems like it doesn't sync anymore to get the data (Steps count) from the samsung charm bracelet. I hope that you can help me with this problem. Thank you."
"I used to use this every day on my walks. Now, it will not automatically track my walks and record the distance. Not even manually. I am not able to have the app track location at all. Very frustrating."
"I like the app. Easy to use and tracks multiple health metrics, but before the recent update it provided an average weight for the week & month. I liked that feature and hope it comes back."
"Great APP. Has all the tools needed in 1 App whether it be for watching your weight, body building, dieting, or if you're a diabetic keeping logs of your glucose levels, carbs, daily steps, blood pressure. I could go on and on. Only recommendation I could give developers is to possibly add UPC barcode scanner when searching for packaged foods."
"And once again an update removes a feature (Weight Management) without warning or explanation. Seriously, Samsung, if apps are too hard, spin off that part of the business and focus on the hardware."
"It was awesome until the recent update which has removed the customized activities (such as light cardio, etc). I hope these activities can be returned to the app. Thanks. I located it, with the help of your response."
Have been using this app for a while now and for the most part really enjoy it the one thing that really annoys me is the incorrect syncing between my Samsung watch and phone for example my phone will say 8670 steps when my watch will say 10345 steps and no matter how many times I refresh or restart my phone or disconnect and reconnect my watch etc nothing works really frustrating
O2 sensor not available anymore . It has supposedly been merged with stress reader of which is not available to Canadian people. Very disappointed with the change . I used the O2 sensor many times after my surgury. It helped me detect that I had pneumonia. oxygen level was extremely low . Very disappointed with the app now . Will definitely think of switching to apple products next time i need a new phone .
"Unable to turn off step counter using phone, does not give option. Only got app to sync work outs and sleep from my Galaxy watch. Don't need a battery draining feature I can't turn off. Had the option on my Note, but not on a non Galaxy phone for some reason .."
Really good app. I love the features and how customizable it is. It connects really well yo my Samsung Active watch. I would like to suggest the nutrition section have options to count calories or just rate your nutrition for the day with smiley faces or number rating system.
An excellent way to track all thinhs health related. It would however have been nice if one could create your own fitness/workout programs instead of only being able to select from programs of in app providers.
"I see I'm not the only one, the app now wants to use/manage phone calls but your policy does not state why. If I sent and try to accept it doesn't allow me access so it's Samsung's way or the highway? Maybe it's time to switch out to a device/company only interested in your health and less about pure data grabbing"
"Useful but a waste of an app with the intrusive ads. I already paid $1,300 for a Samsung phone why do you have to fill all the stock apps with ads? Edit: In response to the message I got from Samsung, yes it does have ads, it even says on the Google Play store ""contains ads."" Come on."
"I had this app for a long time, really liked it before and used it everyday. However, since about 1 year and few months ago, with each new update things started to get worse and worse, until app became unusable and I finally had to uninstall it today. Great job team samsung, if loosing users is your goal you are succeeding!!"
"What's going on? Yesterday the Weight Manage item was listed under my Steps and today it is gone and no where to be found. I see there was an update on 8-5. I track my calories daily and need it back. UPDATE: Thank you for your response. I just bought an A71 and was looking forward to using the Samsung Health App. By removing the weight management functionality, you've reduced the app's usefulness to that of step counter. Please reconsider and add weight management back."
App is relatively clean and easy to use. Nutrition tracking is not very robust or detailed - foods not listed in the nutrition database are tricky to ass manually. Would love increased integration with other platforms like Cronometer that are built for more robust nutrition tracking.
"I've been using Samsung health for the past few years to track my fitness. After lock down I've gained some weight and weight management feature managed to help me to loose weight. After I found out that Samsung Health is not longer going to have the Weight management feature, I decided to roll back to the previous version. I am afraid I am not going to update until the weight management feature comes back."
"App never connects goes into an infinite loading screen and never loads it. I appreciate the instructions. I tried and it did not work. I tried calling as well, and offices are closed. I will call during business hours."
This was a good app until the recent update which eliminated the weight management feature. I had previously raved about this app and recommended it to my friends based on the weight management feature. But now the app has lost it's shine for me.
App just updated an now my phone continuously pops open the app stating that it cant be opened on a rooted phone. This REALLY needs fixed ASAP as it's been all of 10 minutes and I'm ready to smash my phone. Like while typing this it has popped open 3 times and I have to navigate back to what I was doing.
My last review seems to have been deleted. Since you have removed syncing of other apps like google fit you have essentially made my watch redundant. This app is awful. I will not be purchasing another samsung product. Do you not realise that people purchase your products so they can have the freedom of intergrating them with other products. With this update it is now an expensive alarm clock on my wrist.
"It works, , but I cant get it to sync with my watch. When you search foods for your diet, it adds it, but not the nutritional values. There is no edit to add the nutrition yourself, or edit any of the entries nutrition."
"Doesn't track my sleep properly, if I sit it logs sleep time.. going up and down stairs daily is always wrong. Im always moving at work and it will tell me to stretch because I've been immobile to long.. I loved my fitbit and app, was hoping to love the Samsung watch and app too.. but not till they actually work properly. Ya'll need to step it up."
"Bring back the TOTAL STEPS per day, per week, per month. I don't care to know my average stats, I want to know my EXACT STATS. This app is horrible for figuring out distance, etc. Update: Called customer service as directed. They said the avg daily steps could not be changed to totals since the new update, but they would consider requests for changes with the next update. I am hoping that they change it with the next update. Since I have to go through each day and add it myself for the month."
Take the autofill off of the food section. Literally the most annoying thing ever. I cant find a way to delete the items or change the option to autofill. This feature does not enhance user experience or make logical sense.
"Two step authentication does not work. Such in a loop. Enter code and goes back to ""set up two step authentication"". The update had bricked this app and I can't access my previously logged health data Really unhelpful response suggests contacting support via the app BUT I CANT GET INTO THE APP! That's the problem"
"What happened in this last update? Battery usage has jumped up. I'm getting warnings on my phone about high battery usage. I use this app often. I hope this gets fixed. Update. Thanks Samsung for replying, but I can't afford to dial an international number. Not everyone in the world lives in the USA. You are more than welcome to email me."
"This app used to be fantastic, but the last update rendered it useless! The weight management feature has been removed which was the most useful feature the app had. Sadly I'm now looking for an alternative app to use instead. If they bring it back, I will gladly give 5 stars again."
Fonts (tekst) size too small making this application hard to use. Design of application has oversized graphical elements and really small text. It definitely isn't design for older generation (45+). 3 millimeter heigh of text is just ridiculous There is no way in settings to change font size...
App keeps crashing. I've uninstalled and reinstalled it. I've downloaded it from the play store and the galaxy store. I got the new Galaxy Watch 3 and can't even open the app before it closes itself. I use to like the app in the past when I used it.
I like all the different exercises that your app can keep track of...I only hope there was a way to make corrections.. Like when you forget to stop an exercise and keeps going...its cheating bit I dont know how to change it...
"Before the updqte I was very happy with the app! I dont carry my phone with me to every walk, workout or activity now I can't log those steps, distance or calories burned! Many ppl had suggested other apps, it may be time to try them out and delete this one."
Use to be great ... Now it keeps saying app needs to be shut down. Delete app reinstall a couple hours or days and it still keeps popping up on phone mainly . But watch hasn't been right for the last few months.. Agravated spent this much on a watch and phone says compatible... Not sure that's true.....
I loved the app until the Weight Management function was dropped in the latest update. It actually helped me lose 10 kg and I was on my way to lose more. Please bring back this feature.
"It use to work just fine ...but lately it's not counting my steps. The first time that it happened, I reinstalled the app and it work fine. Now it's doing it again..I reinstalled the app but this time it just not working..can u please fix it...have to unistalled for to to start working...getting tiresome! Enough is enough...this app isn't worth the effort of installing again and again..."
"everytime I double check my workout route, Samsung is off. the last one, I ran 2 miles according to this app(my location is enabled and on) however, I used another map app and it said the distance was 2.8. I knew I was out of shape, but not enough to run a 19 min 2 mile... 2.8mi in 19min is a lot more reasonable."
"I've been using this app for about a year now and it was great, but now I'm having the same problem as other 2 users. Not counting runs/bike ride distance and it pauses if the phone is ""asleep "" I need to keep the screen on. Looking for another app already."
I am disappointed with this app. It is recording very high calorie burned from activities to values like 5000 a day. I am really tiny and can only burn on average 1500 a day total. I contacted costumer service several times but nothing has changed so far. This really discouraged me from tracking my daily activity. I am going back to fitbit for my next tracker update.
"following the latest update the app regularly misses out large sections of mins/steps from my walks and has stopped recording locations. where do you find the pedometer? I've looked through all the settings. I've deleted and reinstalled cleaed the cache, but the issue is still ongoing! Also I'm in the UK so where do I call to resolve the issue?"
"It's good, but for a newbie, it's not always easy to figure out what to do. For example, when 'circuit training' is selected, how does it figure out what type of exercises I incorporate? I do INSANITY, by Shaun T.. That burns a lot of calories in a short time. Plus I can't have it on me during all exercises. How would it correctly record my burnt calories? Because every person has their own set of exercises, duration and intensity"
"If you delete watch data for a night of sleep, the app will not allow you to input manually and will not redownload the sleep data. So you get stuck with no sleep logged at all for that night. Otherwise easy food and exercise tracking."
"It used to be really really useful to keep daily track in the quantities of the macros (protein, carbs, fats) that was really useful to know how much grams are you consuming. Saving the last meals at the moment you want to record a new meal has gone. Please bring these features back!!!"
"Bluetooth issue got resolved with a compatiblily of data syncing to Strava. But now the data is not syncing in Strava which is a major concern as lots of cheap smartwatch like noise, Amazfit is having the syncing with Strava It was working till December, please check what has happened now."
"I used to use this app years ago and vary comfortable with it, but suddenly you removed ( pace target ) from the list of running in last update. It was very helpful to me especially with audio guidance. Can you bring it back again?"
can I sync this app with my fitbit? I don't always have my phone with me when exercising and it would be more convenient. this app offers features fitbit doesn't and it would be good to combine them.
When I use the app for cycling and I hit the start button it doesn't record. It stays at pause. In order for it to work you have to uninstall the app and reinstall. It will then work for a couple of days until the problem reaccurs again.
"The app was good until the recent update. It took away the way you could analyze any exercise or All Exercises by days, week, month or year. Now i can never figure out how many miles I have walked or how many miles i ran in the month of august, no i dont want a weekly status, i want to see monthly status plus those data bubbles that u use per day to tell how much a person ran, those bubbles dont have a data Label in them!!! A smaller bubble means I ran less comprd to otr days but no way to quant"
"I used to use this app daily, and I loved it but after it got updated it stopped working. It kept asking for permissions that are not necessary for the app (like access to my contacts). I lost all of my information, and now I have to look for another app. Updates are good but it should not have been changed, and permissions should be only for what the app is intended for with respect to the user's privacy preferences."
I agree with many of the posts about the lost functionality with the latest update. Previously I would have given many more stars. Please bring back the calorie burn counter and the ability to view historical data by month.
"Increasingly unreliable and inaccurate. In one respect it really doesn't matter, but of you go to the expense of buying a tracking device and app then you expect a level of integrity that Samsung are failing to deliver."
"The app overall was very good and helped me maintain knowledge over my workouts and what I eat, it helps to keep track of my steps but needs alot of permission for different things and for the past month everytime I try to open the app it always says there is an unknown error but I have tried to update the app and it still continues to say this."
"Good app with lots of features, would like to be able to log into it on the web / p.c as well as on the mobile, a bit like Fitbit. Works and syncs well with other products and is always improving so would definitely recommend"
"I love it, but why did you have to change the steps widget? I really liked I was able to refresh it manually. I also don't see the point of it saying 100% when you reach your target but not having the percentage visible before reaching your goal."
I use this app daily to track my steps and other things. I find tracking my food easier with myfitnesspal but you can connect the apps so the food I enter into myfitnesspal show up on samsung health so i can see everything in 1 place at the end of the day. i love the layout and the monthly challenges.
"For unknown reasons the app is no longer displaying my sleep record. It registers when I go to sleep, when I awake only. No graphs are displayed. My watch shows the info, however. Uninstalling & reinstalling changes nothing."
*Edit. I have asked to not receive a phone number to call. This has not resolved the issue. I have just bought the Samsung A40 and wanted to set up the Samsung Health app as I have used it a long time on various other devices. I am receiving a message saying access denied. I've no idea why. @Samsung I do not wish to call a number a response would be helpful instead. Thank you
"Data is gone? New update now only some of my data is in steps after tracking since 2015. Frustrating because its almost like steps below a certain threshold were deleted.. one example I walked 6k on 15th of Jan, it was registered on the app then but no data was kept after the update. From reading the other reviews it sounds like Samsung needs a redo."
"The app itself is good. However, it seems like Samsung Health condones cheating. The fact that it is a hundred percent impossible for someone to finish these races on the first day and Samsung Health doesn't do anything about the cheating shows their lack of professionalism. What is the point, other than getting people to be healthy, of doing challenges if are not honest? Be better. If your are going to offer an app that wants people to challenge each other then make it an honest challenge."
Loved the app till they removed the weight management. Even got the s3 watch to go with it. Now I can't stand either one the ap constantly has glitches and the watch barely feels like it works at all. I would not recommend either to anyone.
Gutted that the weight screen has changed. You cannot not compare to where you were last month without having to scroll through days and days of data. It was fine before why have you changed it?? Seriously just thinking of going back to fitbit tbh.
"Demands a lot of personal information, plus a password. Just wanted a simple app to track my bpm and steps. How does a password and personal data provide a better overall service experience. Also..."" Permissions is required to verify the unique device identifier for the together feature and it is not used for other purposes. Granting phone permission to Samsung Health is not intended for an actual phone call or for browsing call history."" if the forgoing is true, then why would I need to password protect my heartrate, pulse, ECG, ounces of water I drink, calories I burn, steps and distance I walk. However, when you demand my DOB, Name, and Location you then create a security nightmare for yourselves and I. Remove those requirements and it becomes a great app. Otherwise my opinion still stands. Furthermore, for the phone to recognize the watch and visa versa he each have a 32 digit EID they use, which in my opinion is far better then any user ID or Password I could ever come up with. Rethink your answer."
"Not good for non-Samsung phones due to low sensitivity. If I walk around for an hour at a medium pace with a Samsung phone in my pocket, I would accrue 3 times more steps as I would accrue in a non-Samsung phone. Extremely disappointed with this once good app."
"I can't record sleep, water, or all that other stuff. When I click on it it takes forever to load, and when it finally does when I click on the button that confirms that I slept that long, that takes forever to load. And after all of that nothing saves. So, now I don't know how long I've slept for the past few weeks even if I went through all that to so. Don't use this app. It sucks."
"This is a basic app that needs updating and more options, especially in the tracking feature. You should be able to set time goals as well as stop tracking when goal is reached."
"I already didn't like the extreme lack of options for food tracking, but now they straight up made it an awful UI and removed the ability to see macronutrients in your daily altogether. Absolute trash and I'm angry I have to switch apps AGAIN."
"Much prefer this as a fitness/ calorie counting app to MyFitnessPal. Much easier to use and much nicer lay-out. Only thing is, there's no food scanner so every item has to be typed out individually."
"App is nice. I just wish they would make a change to the monthly global challenge. The challenge starts on the 1st of the month and if you don't join until a few days later, it doesn't include any of the steps you took that month prior to joining. Since the app calculates your daily steps anyway, why not let those steps be included in that month's global challenge if you join the challenge late? It's hard enough to do 200,000 steps in 30 days, making it useless to join after the 1st of the month."
"I really do like this app but it would be nice if it gave us a few more options on our profile and workout settings, like letting it know if you're pregnant (so it stops telling me I'm obese) or can't eat gluten so your carb intake is significantly lower than others would be and protein is higher. Otherwise it works nicely."
"Great application, but since I changed my phone (to samsung s10+) my level progress is gone. It updated all my data except level (it was back to 1,and I was aroung 20lvl) Also I lost all my friends on app, and when I try to search them again it says ""no available friends"" I wrote to support directly in app but no response."
"After the latest update, the app won't retrieve my sleep data from my Active 2 watch. I even did a factory reset of the watch with no luck. Really disappointing to have close to $1000 of ""smart"" devices and have them not work properly."
The app is not counting my steps. I've unistalled it twice and then reinstalled it. I've also cleared the cache. But this hasn't helped Still not able to sort this out which is extremely frustrating
"Just upgraded my phone to the s21. Backed up my watch to my Samsung account and restored from the new phone. All my apps and stuff transferred but even though this app says it has data, no data shows up anymore so disappointing all my data is gone. even though Samsung has it, I don't get it"
"Okay, why the heck does this app only have one widget when there are several things this app tracks? How about putting my glass-of-water tracker on my home screen so I can easily add that cup when I drink it and not have to go into the app for it? That is info and usability I'd want at a glance, and I'm shocked no one at Samsung hasn't had the same sentiment."
Love the app before. But after recent update app started asking lot of sensitive permissions which I don't feel required. I am using this app to just sync data from galaxy watch and those permissions are not necessary for that. It has to be asked while using a particular feature instead of blocking the entire app.
"I used to LOVE this app. It helped me lose weight and I want to continue doing so. I'm upset because with one of the recent updates, they got rid of the Weight Management. I've noticed other users are also disappointed that Samsung took away that part of the app, too. Please bring it back!"
"The update ruined this app. I can't access my macros with grams, only percentages. Why would you mess with such an important part of tracking? Also, the calories in and calories burned remains screwed up. Save yourself the frustration and use another app."
"I love this app. I've been using it for a couple years now and its helped a ton. However, the newest update seems to have gotten rid of the weight management widget and I'm really disappointed. That widget is the reason SH has worked better for me than any weight mgmt app I've used."
"Super functional and easy to use. It tracks my macros, sleep, steps and workouts. I also love that it offers free guided workouts on days where I'm just having to stay inside. Couldn't ask for more in a fitness app"
"Samsung Health was recently updated and now I can't clear the step detector from my pull-down notification screen without disabling it completely. Super frustrating, because I liked getting a notification about the number of steps I'd taken as an FYI, but then I'd clear it."
"Used to use this a lot, was very good. Now useless. After latest update it does not work. Cannot get past inital screen asking for a login, which then informs me I have an account, and won't go any further. Phone is Galaxy A3 2016. Samsung suggested solution does not work as I am already signed in to my account."
"In line with other recent reviews, I used and loved this app for years, but the recent update asking for access for my contacts list makes no sense and I won't give permission. As it won't let me use the app without me handing out this private data that doesn't belong to me, I have had no choice but to uninstall. Shame really."
"Like many others I deleted the app after it required access to make phone calls. Regardless of the explanation given, that doesn't really make sense and goes well beyond what I'm willing to give for a fitness app. They need a reality check and to get rid of whoever decided that was a good idea."
I miss the old version on this app it seemed to me to be more informative. The weight tracking for example was much more detailed and you could view your progress on a nice detailed graph.
the graphic design in the latest version is over simplified to the point where it became difficult to read track data like curves. please bring back curves instead of the over simplified points. thanks
"I used to find this app very useful but since the update asking to setup two step authentication, the app won't allow me to enter the received code from SMS. Therefore I can't access the app to track my exercise or sleep anymore, it's basically useless. Please be quick in releasing a fix. Edit: I already stated on entering the code, the button to confirm stays dimmed and it is impossible therefore to confirm the code received by SMS"
"App now demands control of phone calls, contacts, camera, and management of all file types, before it will open at all. All 100% unnecessary permissions for this app and there are ZERO valid reasons for an upstanding health app to demand any of these permissions in order to function at all. This a malware app now, which does transmit your contacts out. Canned or inept replies to this issue do not help your position."
"The recent update made it really hard to look at historical info in the app. Instead of being able to look at monthly or weekly trends if I want to see my data from December 2019 I have to scroll and scroll and scroll. Also the app no longer shows any heart rate data from 11:00-11:59 pm for any days, even for days from before the app update when I know the data used to be there."
"I don't understand why they've removed so many features in this last update. I can understand the push to make things prettier and keep moving forward, but it's removed functionality that I used quite a lot, and apparently others have too. Can Samsung just roll us back to the previous version until they get the update right? I'd really like to know how those decisions were made. I've already called support and created a ticket. Phone support is nice, I'll give them that."
I was not able to set the weight target goal to keep track on the food consumption calories and activity calories upon the latest update...???!!! Can u guy response what wrong with this? Able to click in the set target but nothing can be select.. must be really joking. Man.
"Decent app that works well with the watch. I gave it 4 stars however because my primary form of exercise is jump rope, and frustratingly jump rope is not supported on the watch by Samsung health, and currently no other app is available on Samsung that i can download on the watch either."
it does a lot of stuff concerning the watch but i tried to use it like my fitness pal and it doesnt compare as far as entering food. it is so much more difficult on this app because you cant scan in the food and it doesnt have as many items on it as myfitnesspal.
"Does not record steps correctly registered on my Galaxy Active smart watch. I have tried everything and nothing records right. My watch has over 4500 steps recorded right now and Health will only show 1800. I have synched, uninstalled, reinstalled, checked all permissions and recording all steps from phone and mobile...NOTHING WORKS."
I used to really enjoy this app but with the latest update it does not track my calories when horseback riding and that is currently my number one form of exercise. I do love that it's an option but it's very frustrating when the multiple miles and hours I ride a day don't count towards my burned calories.
"Trash. I have been happily using it for that last year, but this latest update makes it unusable. Outside of missing features, it is asking me for my phone number to access the monthly challenge. I don't need it that badly. I will move on to something better."
Inaccurate but can be useful. Please allow stationary exercises to be accurately calculated. I jogged 30 minutes in place with an average heart rate of 120 but data shows I burned 0 calories and completed 0 distance. Also more programs please.
"Great challenges to keep me moving. The calorie calculation algorithm is a bit wonky, but as a guideline, its not bad. I'd love to see barcode scanning for the food entries."
Changing the permissions with the last update was ridiculous. You don't need access to our phones for calls or contacts. It should have been kept as an optional permission. Off to find a new app...
"floors target logging is completely useless, it counts trips in the elevator when you are not even physically moving. Surely they can work out that stationary trips up and down in height are elevator trips and not actual stairs climbed. No point in using this metric until it reads actual stairs climbed."
"Requires access to make phone calls for the ""together"" feature even if you don't use that feature. Should only be a requirement if you use that feature. *EDIT* Services I am not using should not require access to make phone calls. This is the opposite of optimization. You are lying. Bad autoresponse robot, shoo!"
"It's been extremely helpful for me, has with constant exercise and eating better. Helped me in tracking my health, I've been able to keep my weight goals. Guys, gals, you can do it too. Consistency is the key, this app will help you a lot."
Update 10 Sept. Issues resolved with the latest update. Thank you to the dev team Update 9 August. I followed the assistance from the dev team. The only thing that syncs is the step count. No exercise date syncs to the Discovery Vitality app at all. Both apps are fully updated. Phone is Samsung SM-N770F.
"Challenges are attainable for normal people. I do my thing but very discouraging when on the first of the month, there are many who have reached the finish line. I find it has kept me in good physical shape during the pandemic. It pushes me to be better."
"I am not sharing my contacts to be able to use an app. I liked previous versions and having my step count on hand easily. Sorry to see it go down hill. No matter what Samsung say in their response it is unacceptable to me. If could, I would now give it a 0 rating."
"I used to use the app with older versions it was way better, now the interface is so bad, I can't find what I need to find easily and the most important thing, it's not detecting my activities, like cycling or running I need manually to do everything, I need another app, a smart one instead of this one."
I have always used this app to calculate how many miles I run but now it is messing up and not calculating my miles at all. I will for sure do 2 miles and it will say i only did 0.21 and only walked 500 steps. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling but that didnt seem to work. I hope they fix this soon.
"I have used this app for years to record steps, weight etc. but now it's almost completely useless. Weight dashboard = GONE Pulse sensor feature =GONE What was a user friendly app has become a big waste of time. You can't see your monthly weight progress which is particularly frustrating. PLEASE RESTORE THE OLD FEATURES!"
"this is the only app i ever tried for keeping track of my steps & working out , it works well & its simple to use that's good enough for me never had any problems for over 2 years so far if it isn't broken don't fix it. i hope this review is useful for someone that is not sure."
"Like everyone else says, the app is now just about pointless since they've removed main features. The app also incorrectly just uses a formula to calc calories instead of the heart rate monitor.. so stupid. Luckily I'm still within my refund range for my watch."
"This used to be a good app, but as several others have said, they have removed so many useful features now. And now you can't even log workouts manually anymore. What the hell? What's the point of removing that feature? I forgot, for once, to start my fitness watch, and now there's a whole hour long session that I can't record. How is this now supposed to help me keep track of my activity level properly?"
"They removed the standalone oygen saturation meter, and made it more difficult to find my oygen levels. It is now located within the stress meter which takes forever to get a read. I did like this app but now since they removed the o2 meter I won't use it anymore."
"Tried to enter running manually, but it won't go past 30 SEP 21. When you try it shuts down the app. Over the last few years I feel like if it says Samsung, you have to deal with some level of product failure"
"It keeps having me go through a two step process, keeps saying my password is incorrect, I change password, still can not get back into app. I've uninstalled it, set it to factory settings, nothing helps. EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING"
"Works great loaded with features only issue is with continuous heart rate displayed it lags to the touch and it seems to shake, wish i was able to open a bigger graphs on all stats. With that being the only issue ive ever def worth the download"
"Love using the calorie counter, steps and sleep monitor. PLEASE bring back meals from previous days to copy!!! Horrible without that feature! That being said, I still love this app and it's features!!"
I like that the steps are accurate and I enjoy the challenges that they give. But I dont like that you cant add workouts and steps. I work in the public all the time and I cant always have access to my phone. I'd give it a 5 star if they fixed it .
"I haven't used all of the functions yet, but seems fairly useful. I would like to be able to enter water intake differently though. Either custom glass sizes or be able to enter ounces rather than glasses."
"Last few updates have raised doubts(atleast in my case). Walking is not being tracked appropriately. Over last 4 days, twice it failed to track initial 10 minutes of walking. Also it is breaking activity into 30 minutes sessions even the activity is a continuous one"
"Decent app, but annoying that each month I need to select my partner on the together challenge. Why can't this be automated? Also, GPS does vary day to day, I do a 30 min walk each lunchtime on the same route, however the distance calculated varies most of the time and also differs to my wife's distance who walks with me."
"If anything else, this app reminds me and even challenges me to get moving and thus helps with my accountability to exercise on a daily basis. It's a really great personal health tool. Additionally, there are other great features that this app helps record, in order to live a healthier lifestyle."
"From perfect to who cares?The recent update has turned this app barely effective. I can no longer see my food goal rating of over/under /perfect. And, I lost over years worth of history. Very disappointed."
This app was great until they got rid of the weight management feature. It was the reason I left apple and my iwatch behind. I guess I will be looking for another alternative or going back because you made it another glorified step counter.
"App now requires access to phone and contacts to use. Had been using it to track runs with my samsung watch, but sync issues began to be a problem and the app won't function without additional permissions now to seal the deal . Back to map my run."
"Like several others have commented, I think that the styling on the latest update is detrimental. It uses more space to give less information. I have also noticed that, since the update, it stops logging steps via my phone's internal step counter."
"Very complicate. Hard to pair or impossible to pair with other popular devices like xiaomi balance or google fit. And... Can anybody explain to me how it's possible I've lost all my data after factory reset on my phone and whatch? After re sign in to the application with my Samsung account, it's telling me there are no activity data last thirty days. What for is the Samsung account cloud, if it cannot keep the data? Honestly I really regret to buy the Samsung watch and using this app."
"I used this app on a daily basis to track my carb, calorie & fats. Your latest upgrade no longer displays total grams on meals logged. This was the best app I had found, easy to add food intake with current totals to help keep me on track. Unfortunately, I will be searching for a new app."
"If I could negative stars!!! I would, I hate that 02 sensor is gone as well as pulse. Worthless app!! Suggestions that it had moved to Stress are wrong, app doesn't work, just a useless catalog your own numbers app now, I could do that in S Note."
"Samsung changed the privacy agreement to allowing it to have access to EVERYTHING! Your email, pictures, contacts, etc. This is NOT necessary and you cannot access the app without agreeing. So, NO!"
"Permission Creep - now won't start without phone permission. I don't use, nor wish to ever use the ""feature"" Samsung allegedly requires this for. I just want to see my own data...not share it. While Samsung may have totally honorable intentions...hacking and breaches are all over the news. Better to not enable permissions needlessly. Let the user decide what feature/risk profile is right for them."
I use this app to track my weight. With the recent update I can no longer see weekly and monthly averages which are much more useful to track weight loss/gain. Day to day weight changes tell me nothing. Please bring those features back!
"Overall, it is a great app. I would like the option to include workouts other than walking and running, and I would like to be able to adjust my macro goals to aid in my diet goals."
"I really like the app, it encourages me to push myself. I wish it could figure whether I am walking or biking in case I forget to change it manually. Also if you could distinguish types of fats (Trans fat, olive oil, avocados etc..) instead if lumping them all into the same category it would be most helpful. Just curious if there are many other Californians participating in the challenges? Thank you!‚òÆ"
I like it but the weight management you got rid of when you updated the app. That was the main thing I used. I like how you added the menstrual period. So please do not get rid that and just add the weight management back please.
"This app could be better.. I don't like how you can't easily see the number of days per week you have worked out (ex 6/7 days), and I don't like how you cant log an entire workout including time and calories.. it's very restricted in that sense.. please make some good changes!"
"Good for tracking sleep. And literally nothing else. Can't scan any bar codes on food for easy logging, heart rate monitor is infuriatingly inaccurate and won't measure your heart rate without giving you at least 2 errors before measuring properly. I expect better out of Samsung and this app is a hot pile of garbage."
"It was a nice app until they introduced mandatory two step verification. Let me decide how I want to protect my data and dont make it mandatory. I stopped using it because of this. Can't be bothered to set it up. Edit after reply: seems you do not even bother reading the review. I know it will be working when I set up the verification. But I dont want to!! Let me decide how I want to protect my data. It is none of your business! As you dont bother, I am uninstalling."
"Honestly I'd give this negative stars if possible, the fact that Samsung thinks they can serve ads with no option to turn off in almost all there apps, phones, and TV's that consumers pay hundreds of dollars for is ridiculous! I don't care about your stupid products that have nothing to do with me, and I don't need the top section of the health app showing me useless garbage. Give users a option to at least disable them, if I pay $300 for a smartwatch you shouldn't be able to force ads on me."
"It was a fabulous app correctly monitoring everything. But since the android upgrade to pie, it has started malfunctioning. It does not monitor steps if the screen turns off... Earlier it worked absolutely fine!"
The best motivation app ever. I sometimes challenge my friends in it on a 50 thousand or 100 thousand steps And the first one to complete it gets a reward so that's keep us walking and even sometimes we skip riding the our cars and general transportation just to get more steps and win the challenge so that why i like it.
"You must develop a module for disabled people (wheelchair users for example) since counting/burning calories differ deeply from able-bodied people. The app now is calculating the steps based on the walk process, however, we're actually moving hands only (connected to the S3 gear). Please consider this as a priority, hence, you'll be the first provider to do so. Thanks"
"I love this app. I can keep information from my old watch and easily sync up my new watch. One improvement I would suggest is adding a mood tracker to the app. It can track stress, but more moods would be amazing."
"Removed the active time feature, which I needed. I see no way of adding it back. F me for updating, apparently. >:( Edit: replaced with a horrid graphic. Give us the option. Old way was a lot quicker. Edit 2: now this review is back and the other is gone. I give up"
wont work since latest android update since I don't latest android update the app wont work. keep getting error saying it won't work in a rooted phone. my phone hasn't been rooted. everytime I load app it just gives message and cuts out. them during other apps it keeps coming up again
"I would give it a 5 but I have pros and cons Cons first 1-I wish there was a side column where it puts all the program I completed in that topic. 2-Then I wish the programs that I choose are in the side column where it said ""let start"" so I know that's my program. Also, wish they was organize by dates so I know which one to start instead of looking for it.i know I can organize it myself that what I like to but wish their a filter that does it when we want it in order. Overall it's great app."
It's been a great companion for me when I take my regulation walk thrice a week. But I found it to my unbelievable surprise it stopped recording after 30 minutes of my walk. I don't know why it let me down! Hope it works next time when I go out.
"I've recently replaced a fitbit tracker with a new Samsung watch, and am relatively new to the Samsung health community. But it seems to me that there are some obviously glaring improvements that I was surprised to discover. I am not only disappointed, but APPALED, that there is currently no female health tracking option in neither the App nor the watch. In my opinion, Health cannot even compare to Fitbit until this has been remedied. Not only that, I'm curious as to why it doesn't yet exist."
"There was a terrible update in August that removed the weight/calorie tracker. I have waited months for an update to replace it with something similar, but nothing has come. This app is becoming useless."
"Since I updated to latest version 6.18.5.023, I can't sync my workout and step data to my other device. This happend within this 3 days. Example, I using 2 device with same Samsung Account, previously is no problem for me to sync my workout/step data from Device A to Device B, but this 3 days no matters how I sync, the data can't appear in my the other device. Please check for it, thanks."
It's great! I use it all the time. It would be nice if we could log any symptoms we felt during the day like a cold or a headache (my version doesn't allow this feature). It would be nice too if we could log how we're feeling and period dates.
I love this app. It syncs perfectly with my watch but I absolutely hate the look of the new update! I am mostly tracking my sleep and it's hard as all get out for me to read properly now. It would be 5 stars had it not been for this change.
"The latest update is TERRIBLE. It looks like a child's app now. They have taken away most of the details around meals and added progress bars instead, which are totally inappropriate for my diet and goal tracking."
"With each successive update, this app becomes a little worse. First the SpO2 was gone, and now, unless I give the app access to my contacts, I can't even use the little functionality still there. If it weren't so hard to uninstall, I would have done so long ago. This app auto-updates even when you turn auto-updates off, yet they still have the nerve to say, ""Trust us, we won't abuse your permissions."" Yet one more reason to convince me to never buy a Samsung again. Update: Nice to see the SpO2 function restored, and access to my contacts is no longer required after the public backlash. I'm still not sure why a health tracking app needs to know my phone number, but I guess that's the price we pay for free apps."
The last update includes several bugs. Food search regularly does not show any results without closing & reopening app. Newly entered weight is not immediately displayed. Please fix your app! It used to be 5 stars! Not anymore.
They changed permission settings not allowing me to use the app without giving them access to my contacts and other permissions that I don't feel comfortable with. I will go to other apps until they fix this. I loved this app before this change.
"I like this app. HOWEVER even though there are dozens of sections- many of which are unnecessary- there is no period calendar. It should not be really hard to integrate a section that nearly all women need and use from different apps. All we need is a neat, basic UX where we can see ovulation & menstruation days based on avarage cycling tracks."
"Great app, love the global challenge, although I think there is alot of cheating going on with the top position. (side note) if your having issues with the new update especially ""together"" just uninstall and reinstall, fixed my issue with it not wanting to work, might help others.."
I used to love this app. Specifically the step counter becaused it had an option to show monthly statistics and this used to motivate me to compete with the previous month. Now they changed it from monthly basis to last 30 days which sucks and I no longer use the app.
"Latest update disables the app unless you grant it access to Phone permissions. Edit to reply to dev comments: Great! So only ask for the extra permissions if I try to access the features that need those permissions. When you change the app to do that I'll change my review! Until then, tbh, I don't trust Samsung with any of my information that they don't explicitly need, especially because I don't have any interest in my health app having its own junky social network."
Very disappointed with the new update. Weight features are gone! It was the best part of the app and now I don't even open it anymore. Pity I own a Samsung watch because it synced very well.
The app stuck in the two step verification. It went through and set itself up but then got caught in a loop and brought me back to set up verification again which now gives me an access forbidden message. This makes the Samsung watch I bought pretty much useless to me.
I use to really enjoy using this app especially for weight loss for you could see your weight change by month or week or whatever you wanted. Know it is my day and I don't like or really use it now the way it is now. So not happy with the changes of the app. I wish it was back like it was. For then it was useful it isn't now.
"Together worked fine until the update. Now every time I open the Together tab I'm forced to verify again, every single time. I cant leave the app open cause it drains battery. Other than that it's an amazing application."
"Bug errors and a lack if listening to te community leads to a lack luster app. Skateboarding not added as an exercise. Steps are inaccurate, some being recorded in the future. Also massive cheating in global challenges."
"At first I thought this app was a little obnoxious but then i started challenging myself to do more every day. Then it turned into, trying to reach certain achievements an now I'm training for a half marathon!"
Terrible App to log food intake. Switched to Active 2 watch from Fitbit. Options to enter food accurately unless you want to measure in grams and calories. Fitbit gives more options to measure. Pointless function if I have to look up food elsewhere to use the app. The latest update brought my review from 2 stars to 1.
"Struggling to understand the new changes, less information and more wasted space, I liked that I could see my walking, cycling separately. Will stick with it as I'm tied to it for other reasons but a retrograde step."
"I'm really upset as the recent update on the 5th August 2020 has removed the weight management section, this is what has helped me to loose 1.5 stone at a gradual steady pace. As I balanced excercise with my food intake. Now this has gone, I'm not sure how it will work, I do hope this can be fixed very soon and we can all have it added back to this app, otherwise this is a fantastic app. Thankyou"
"Since the update nothing works, used to be great, now absolute rubbish. Cycling, I turn location on, run the app. It counts down goes into pause and doesn't resume, and therefore doesn't track my ride stats."
"I really wish I had not updated!! ü§¨ It now wants permissions I don't see any need for, such as making phone calls and access to contacts. It won't even show me my stats or exercise information now so it's COMPLETELY USELESS. I've had my fitband for just over a year but now I can't use the companion software and I've effectively lost all my data. I've been a devoted Samsung user since 2013 but this is how you treat me. What am I supposed to do now?? And don't give me the US 1800 number bs."
"Why would I need 2 step verification for a health app.. so stupid. What are people going to find out, how many steps I've done today?! oh dear. Why does this app get more annoying and less user friendly with every update. It's not even a choice either it forces you to use it. Then when you do it, it says you need to change your password THEN it logs you out and says your credentials are wrong, and doesn't let you log in again! Yikes. I just want to count my steps, why you gotta make it so hard."
Been using this app for years. It's always had things I didn't like but now you guys actually broke it for me. I hate that I can't see my macros on the food screen. I want to see grams but now I have to go to the learn more screen to see anything more than percentages. That was not a good decision. The percentages were always there. Why take the grams off? Why make it harder to see my details? I'm switching fitness apps. Hopefully you guys can fix this mistake so I can come back.
"It would be better if the developer includes energy expenditure for the practitioners of Tai Chi Chuan. There are a broad data base that can be use to measure it. I was expecting the adding of Tai Chi to it since the calories expending are greater than some activities that you have in your list. Now I found a new app which got. Thanks anyway, I'm moving on."
"Clunky app, hard to navigate really and compare daily health metrics. The way the information is displayed makes it hard to digest. So much information seems to be condensed into a weird layout Ugly ads built into the app ruins the experience as well."
Have tried to use this app twice now but both times I have trouble searching for food items and as I am counting calories this is most important. It might show food items one day and the next day when using search button does not do anything. I have synced everything as others users have said but no use. I would have given it 5 stars otherwise.
I'm a long time customer and unhappy.. Our features were taking away and that is not right an upgrade is suppose upgrade but we were down graded to a basic feature all the money it cost for the phone customers should be treated better. I have upgraded phones for years and I have not recently.
"Samsung does a great job with their health app. Highly recommend this app if you have a comparable smart watch to work along with it! Helps me track my sleep, heart rate, stress levels, step counter, and blood oxygen level, as well as show me how active I am compared to other people my age on the app!"
"I'm NOT giving you access to my contacts and camera. Please don't bother giving me your automated answer of optimal performance blah blah blah. Samsung has crossed a line. Glad so many people are speaking up. Its like having your health data held hostage unless we give them what they want. If they don't listen to their users and change this soon, I refuse to use it and I'm not buying Samsung again. I hope a lot of people do the same."
New widget has small font size making it difficult to read numbers on the go. Previous one was better.. or just give us another widget with only steps counter. Or may be visual widget with just a circle that gets filled up as i walk/run. But this widget is useless.
"If I could give this zero stars, I would. This fuelled my daughter's anorexia and OCD more than I would've deemed possible. I hate it with a passion. This app made her think that she must have low calories all the time, exercise all the time and think that weight gain is bad. She consumed no more than 500 calories a day and ended up in hospital underweight and malnourished. Instead of using an app, listen to your body. Please."
"Update: past few days the step counter is not syncing properly with the watch. Great app, and very motivating. Would be very useful if there were more nutrients added(more vitamins etc.)"
Been using this app for some time now but in the last few months it has stopped tracking my walks/runs and does not produce a map of my route. Location is turned on on my phone and Gear Fit 2. I can't understand it!
"really good for keeping track of steps, general calorie intake and active time. anything and everything can always be improved, but I love this app and was totally lost without it afew months back."
"The oxygen saturation never works anymore. From what I can tell off the internet, it's a known problem with this update version. I tried to download an older version, but it doesn't work anymore. And YES, the multiplier is on."
"Why, oh why have you changed the way that sleep patterns are displayed? The new way is really hard on the brain for people with neurological issues. Please change it back or find a less 'angry' way to display this data. Updated 1/6/2020 New update has taken away one of the key tools I use this app for, the breakdown of how many minutes are spent in the different heart rate zones in a day. I can't believe that anyone though removing such valuable data was a good idea, please bring it back"
Had used this app for years with great satisfaction. However with recent update I can no longer use the app without granting permission to access my contacts and allowing it to make calls. Now there are ads?????? UNACCEPTABLE!!!!! I don't buy the line about enhancing the user experience. THIS user's experience was just fine before. How could the developer think that my experience would be enhanced by giving permission to access calls and contacts????? The app tracked what I needed BEFORE!!!
good app but very buggy wouldn't recommend the spo2 sensor is extremely inaccurate if I followed the readings from it I'd be in hospital iv had readings as low as 70% and it seems to have disappeared from the app aswell apart from under the stress measurement please fix this as it's one of the reasons I bought the phone is for the added health benefits of tracking stress heart rate and spo2 levels on the go but they are useless as they are to inaccurate useless Samsung please fix this
"Good app, except why isn't there an option to see for example the total distance of a specific months running? I don't really care about the average. I heard that this feature was in the older versions so why delete it?"
Awful and useless. Never syncs properly with the Galaxy watch. Would be easy to have a Stress measurement for this app: every time you open it and believe this time it will work. Give up. It doesn't.
"I donnow what happened within the most recent GUI updates but it's tracking walking & running speeds incorrectly. For instance on my treadmill I have a walk speed average of 3.5 mph, but the app is clocking me at 2.9 mph. The older app clocked me at my treadmill speed! Please fix this!"
"App is good but after updating the app, i am unable to sync it with Healthify Me. Till yesterday night it was working fine but today i have updated the app and i have started facing issues. All the required permissions have been given still no luck. I wish I could attach screenshots."
"Use to love this app. Last few months or so the step counter has been VERY inaccurate. It would say I walked like 6 miles... In 10 minutes... While I slept. I don't sleep walk. And I like to have the small step counter widget on my home screen, only option now takes up so much room and I don't need all that info. I just want the number. 1x1 or 2x1. Not half the screen."
"This app was one of the best applications that I use to track my activities, wight, health indicators etc. I have been using this app for years but now I am rating it bad because it forces me to grant the permission for my contact for a feature that I am not interested in. Since I refuse to give the permission, it does not allow me to access the app. Anyway, I will never give the permission for my contact and they should respect the privacy of their users"
"No Garmin Connect sync option, delayed sync with other apps like UA record, no option to force a manual sync. I would like to be able to rearrange the order of items on the home screen."
"I really enjoyed this app but now it wants permission to ""make and manage phone calls"" on my phone. Maybe they will remove that so you have an option to allow it or not. Until then I will not give permission for this app to make and manage my calls. Maybe you should make that part of the app optional."
This app has help connect me with resources to help me with my diabetes. When I forget it reminds me and all other things in the app are so helpful. Today is my first problem though. I need to log in my meds. However the diabetes wellness is not connecting. I already restarted my phone and other stuff to try to see if it would help but it is not helping. Maybe time will help or I will have to figure something else out. I do not want the app or resources to go. This seems to be the only thing help
Very poor app. Doesn't update stats without WiFi connection even though I have mobile data and won't load on my tablet as for some stupid reason it must have access to a SIM card! Also has very limited support for 3rd party services.
2 stars since the last update. now my steps and heart rate are not functioning. Very disappointing. Had to edit. Followed Samsung instructions. Easy fix. Everything works fine now. Thank you. Back to 5 stars.
"A great application to track your sleep, steps and weight if you have the right accessories. Food tracking is a bit difficult with this application but it connects to other applications such as MyFitnessPal to allow you to sync calorie data."
"Since the update, the app stalls at the two-step verification stage: it gets caught in a feedback loop, first asking whether I agree to the privacy policy, then asking me to verify, and then taking me back to the first step asking me to agree to the privacy policy. I've tried different phone numbers, to no avail. It has rendered the whole app inoperable."
I'm dissapointed with the latest update - oxygen saturation has been lumped in with stress so it's no longer possible to measure and track those trends separately. It was my most used measurement and very helpful with my breathing problems.
The last month I keep having to delete the app and reinstall it otherwise it doesnt recognize my watch. I keep losing all my tracking information. I love when it works but it needs an update to fix the issue currently.
"Just stopped counting steps. I walk around for 2 hours and my steps count just stays at 1237 on both Galaxy 10 and active 2. I then sync and boom, it becomes 1239, 2 steps added after 2 hours walk. I tried to walk around and watch the step count on both, my watch and phone, none count. I have restarted and reset both devices."
I received an update and now I have to allow samsung access to make and receive phone calls as well as to my contacts. I'm uncomfortable with this but the app won't open until I allow it. I will switching to a different health app.
"I like all the functionality of samsung health. One thing that would make it more user friendly is when adding food, if we could scan the bar codes of the foods instead of having to type everything in."
"In these times,I am doing indoor runs only.and I think ,due to switching off GPS,the app does not calculate distance correctly as against the amount of time I run. Plus the steps done doting fun are not added to the daily step count."
"Can't use the app at all after the update UNLESS you agree to give permissions to all sorts of personal info on your phone including your contacts list, storage, camera,phone, etc. I am currently getting ready to uninstall Samsung health. I've used it the past few years and have loved it, not now, I'm sure I can find another app. Why do you need access to everything on my phone? This is a personal information invasion!"
Since the update happened I can no longer sync my steps from Samsung Health to Health sync to Google Fit. Everytime I try to enable the permissions it gives me an error message saying one or more permissions have not been enabled which all of them are enabled on my phone. Please fix this issue
"This was a great app, had it for years across multiple phones with no issues. The recent google webview issue where google 'forgot' to tell everyone to update meant i had to reset my phone and since then the app doesnt work. Such a shame."
"This app is normally so good. But as of late it'll stop counting the activities or calories burned in the middle of a workout. So regardless that I worked out for 1 hour, it'll get stuck counting and never updates and show that I only burned 150 calories, which I know is incorrect. Please fix!"
This app is not even close to being accurate when calculating kilometres during jogging. For every 1km it adds about 0.5km to my running distance. Extremely frustrating. Please note that I have contacted you via your email address.
"As of Dec 2021: SHealth has good features, but their data collection & use has become uncomfortably invasive - especially in regard to the Together feature. To use this they require access to all of my phone contacts so any SHealth users can automatically be added to my Friends whether I want them or not. Now they require collection of ""sensitive personal data"" that will be shared with others who ""may not provide the same level of data protection..."" Nothing they say can make this acceptable."
"This app is great, I will give you a 5 star if you can just add 1 more feature. When setting your target for food, make it so you can choose your macronutrients targets as well such as fats proteins and carbs. Everything else is perfect"
The app is not workin properly after the upgrade. I'm unable to link devices and other apps. I doubt the developers did proper testing. Please urgently release a fix for this bug. I'm unable to sync data with my Medical Aid rewards application Discover Health
"Hi, I've problems connecting my Samsung health to sync with my healthy 365 app. What happen with the updates? my Samsung fit2 is sync with my Samsung health, now healthy 365 don't see that I have the Samsung health install in my phone, even though that was installed all the while. very frustrated üò†"
"Why does this app not work without allowing access to calls, camera, files and contacts? Can't use app with just the relevant sensors and activity permissions. Shame bc I have a Samsung watch which is much less useful without the app. Guess I'll switch to fitbit, too bad Samsung you're losing a customer."
"New update is HORRIBLE! VERY difficult to use!! Logging sleep data went from one screen to multiple, one for amount then another for quality. As of today you have to maneuver if you don't want the app's calculation."
"Some days the App just do not count steps and I have to restart the phone to get it to work. Also there is no option to enter personal step length, hence distance walked in incorrect as the app calculates distance by average step length. Disappointed"
"They removed the weight management feature which allowed me to set goals balancing food intake and calories burned through exercise each day. I don't really use it for much else, so I will be looking elsewhere."
"This app worked better with my old galaxy watch than it did now. After I do a detected workout and look at it in this app, it does not have my heart rate correct. As a 74 year old woman, I don't believe my moderate heart beat should be over 91. I have done the math from the app and it should be about 73. I do not know how to fix this. Help, please. Thank you."
"I spoke to a very apologetic Samsung representative who agreed that there is no need for this app to make and manage calls and assured me this permission would be optional in the new update. The app will not allow me to finish setup without granting permission to make and manage calls. Uninstalled. Again. Also, listed developer contact is a ""noreply"" email address. Could you be any more contemptuous of your users?"
"It never was very easy to use. Now they have forced me to add 2-step verification, because ""they share my phone number with friends"" So now, it's even more trouble and much more than it's worth. How about this? How about you don't share any of my information unless I tell you to. Uninstalled. Looking for a new smartwatch. The reason given was because it may share my phone #. When installed, it demands permission to read phone #. Why?"
"Had to remove. Everything updated last week and since then SHealth decided to run constantly in the back ground killing my phone battery. Ive used this app for the past 3 years and never had an issue. And yes, i tried changing settings, nothing worked."
Take out the mandatory access to phone and 2 step verification and I could give a true rating. I used to use this with my last android phone and it worked well- however since my last time resetting my current phone I can't even load the app without jumping through all these hoops- I don't have to give Fitbit access to invite friends if I don't want to and don't have to have 2 step verification so it should be a choice here too
"I don't like the latest update. I walk multiple times a day for exercise. I like keeping track of my steps for each individual walk. The app no longer gives me the steps for each walk, It's only a combined total now. Not good."
"I can't seem to figure out the problem. The app with not sync with my steps or workout on my active 2 watch. They are signed into the same account, and I'm even trying back up and restore. Idk what's wrong."
"Very useful app. It would be nice if the graphics, like the recorded sleeping, where interactive and one can obtain more detailed information from them."
"I agree with the comments below. I have used and loved this app for years, but the current update just goes TOO far on access to my personal data. I got rid of my Samsung cell phone and now I will get rid of this app. I'm sure there is another app that will give me the same functionality without prying into my life. Samsung - you have gotten way too big for your britches!"
"They now require you to give them control to make and manage your phone calls. This is beyond excessive. I bought a $300 watch to monitor my health, now I can't use it (since all the info is sent to the app) and I'm pissed! Their response is, the app is not actually used for making and managing phone calls, then why are they asking for that permission?! It directly asks for the permission to ""make and manage phone calls""."
"I used coffee tracking every day and now it's gone. Also something strange happening with food tracking. Seems like less things to track. I wish I could have costumizable widgets for tracking anything I want, not static unreliable."
I had the Fitbit versa & app. I was able to set a reminder for every hour to remind and advise how many steps needed to keep on y'all of my desired daily steps. This would better perfect if it had that option. It will allow me to be sure to complete my daily steps
Excellent! High quality apps that tracks lots of different things for health. I especially love the Global Challenges for steps so I can participate in competitions and earn badges while it tracks my steps. I use this with a Galaxy Watch and it's perfect.
With the new update they stopped including the carb number. I'm trying to watch my carbs for being on my keto diet and now I can't keep track of my card number. Please reinstate the carb number! Also the app is very kindergartenish. They are dumbing everything down But a lot of people I think still want the expert knowledge that the data gives us. Please give us the data!
"They recommend too many daily calories when I want to lose weight. They have a good directory of foods and drinks. However, I want to be able to specifically choose my daily calories goal outside the range given to me."
New permission is unnecessary. I have read your response to others with this complaint and you do not need permission/access to calls and contacts. There is no 'better experience' you can provide to me with that information. App deleted.
"I left a review regarding how difficult it is to get support. The developer replied but when I return here, my review had been deleted. I read their reply in my email and they stated I could contact support through the app but that just leads you to a message board and doesn't put you in touch with customer support. Terrible experience, no customer support."
"If I could let you know how it actually performs, instead of ""unexpectedly shut down"". Seriously, every 5 - 10 mins, no matter what I'm doing on the phone, Samsung health crashes. I'm sick of sending error reports. How this garbage is still allowed on the playstore is beyond me. Seriously, DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME WITH SAMSUNG HEALTH!"
"Won't even login. Your update is garbage. It's made my expensive watch a useless hunk of metal. If I wanted a time piece that did nothing but tell the time I would buy an analog watch. Definitely considering it heavily now. The best help I got from the phone number was to wait, no idea how long - days, weeks, months, years - and just hope you fix it. That's really not a good look for Samsung Update: I did everything you told me to do in your reply, before I posted my review. It did nothing. That is why I called you to only be told you have no idea when your own app will work - NO IDEA WHEN IT WILL WORK. FOR A $300 WATCH. That is baloney"
"(this review 3/4/19) This app is a BATTERY HOG. I rarely open this app. I have it to sync my fitness data from my Gear Fit 2 and that is it. Without even opening the app, I'm finding that it drains 20-25% of my battery in a day. Previously, I was able to restrict background usage through Android settings. However, this doesn't work anymore - it tells me the app usage is in the foreground. I cannot imagine why an app I do not open is running in the foreground constantly and draining my battery."
The app was giving me some trouble so I decided to reinstall to try and fix the problem. I didn't know the app needed my number to work. I recently went to another country and left my sim card back at home. Now I get an unknown error occurred message. Why don't they use an email address for verification instead of a phone number? It was a great app and I enjoyed tracking my activities through the app; I really hope I can get a solution.Now I will be locked out of the app for over a year. Thanks.
this is problem that I have last week I select the walk exercises and the app suggest turn on GPS to keep track which I did and I walk ok total of 8 miles but when I done waking Samsung health show that I only walk only 6.3 miles. I did put the address from the start to end on Google map if I wanna walk shows that it's about 8 miles is the distance. but I don't why this app it's not accurate I hope they fix otherwise I have to go use other app
Why did you removed the WEIGHT MANAGEMENT feature in this new update? That was the most usefull feature in this app. I'm really dissapointed that I can't see now my progress during a day. Please bring it back! I used to love this app as it helped to loose weight. I've even recommended it this app to my family and friends. With this new version I wouldn't promote it.
"Overall a pretty good app with some really handy features. However, the steps challenge normally has a defect while calculating the final steps at the end of the competition."
"This app is scanning your device and limiting the options available on the basis of your phone being a Samsung device. Friends with Samsung phones have had no interruption in functionality. Call customer service, wait your turn in line and get the truth. I feel for those who bought Samsung accessories that will be limited by their choice in phone manufacturer."
Two step verification required and doesn't even work. I've tried multiple times to setup this feature and then when I enter the code that is sent to my phone the app stalls and doesn't even accept it. Used to really like this app. Uninstalling.
"I used to love this app but since the latest update it doesn't display sleep data all the time. If it does display it, it takes about 7 minutes to load and display. Hopefully Samsung does an update again soon to fix it."
Good app. Unfortunately in Canada the stress and other features aren't available. It would also be nice to be able to swipe through different days and see complete stats.
"My account seems to be attached with my Gmail therefore I can't just sign in with a email and password. You are forces to hit the ""sign in with Google"" which would generally be fine but after you click your account it just brings up a loading page and brings you back to the main login. Finally signed in when I was setting up my smart watch after about 20+ tries. This has been my experience with all of the Samsung apps I've tried to login on."
"I love this app and use it regularly. Would give it 5 stars but a) only works with certain brands of trackers, and b) the sleep graph no longer shows a difference in type of sleep. I used that difference to help guage my sleep problems but the last update ruined that. I use a cpap and this app used to help me keep track of my rem sleep. Now i can't. It really needs fixed!!!!"
It doesn't record heart rate data from watch when I start the treadmill workout. Returning my watch. Samsung software is so buggy. Going back to the iPhone for my next upgrade.
I'm Terribly Disappointed I have really enjoyed this app. I have been able to hold myself accountable for years by using it daily. I'm disappointed I will not continue using this app to track my activity and weight. The updated version is requesting me to authorize contact information that I will not share. I would like to hear any Health & Fitness apps that are recommended.
"Really awful app. Intrerrupts me 2x a day, every day, to close because it's not responding, even when I'm never using it. Supposedly syncs to my gear fit 2, but always shows different stats. Pretty well useless."
"I was incredibly fed-up when I found the app had updated and I had lost all my data and settings. I am grateful to the team for emailing me, I am humbled that my review was read. I took the time after dinner to sit and re-enter everything and start again üòô I am SO DISAPPOINTED, I had just started on a ""new me"", lose 1.5 stone, increase my energy output within my own limits, strictly monitor kcal energy input and look forward to feeling better about me and maybe the world. I've lost all my data and settings, had a really tough day at work and now THIS üôÅ"
"Generally I use this app for cycling. It has great user interface, data collection and graphics but there is one thing that ruins all of these; SAMSUNG HEALTH DATA NOT REACHABLE FROM OTHER DEVICES LIKE COMPUTER. Not only me but also MANY SAMSUNG HEALTH USER WANT TO see their data by their other devices. You can look at this subject on Samsung Community and see how many people wants this. It is nonsense to use other apps while I have a Samsung device. Please add this feature too and make it perf."
"Samsung just got rid of their ""weight management"" section of this app. This was the main reason most users used the app, including myself. You no longer have a running comparison of calories burned vs. eaten, in fact there is no clear way to even see how many total calories you've burned at a glance. I know many people are getting rid of Samsung wearables because of this. I bought a Samsung watch only a week ago, and had I known this awful change was coming, I wouldn't have."
"I used this app back before pre covid 19 days. I love the features where you were able to track your heart rate, weight management and calorie intake. I am a breast cancer survivor. I didn't and don't want to have to download all these different apps... when your app was an ""all in one"" app. Please consider bringing those features back on the next update. I'm sure everyone using it will greatly appreciate it. Thanks and God Bless."
"PLEASE add the feature to edit / trim recorded exercises! If I forget to end a workout on my watch, then I am stuck with 20+ minutes of nonsense tacked onto the end of the workout I tried to record and it ruins all of the data."
"The weight management feature was one of the best and you took it away. It was very helpful, lost went from 240 to under 200 using that feature, would like it back."
Amazing ap. I really like the challenges and workouts but lately I have a problem that I hope you guys can help with: for me the july challenge didn't start.. it keeps showing me the one from june with the message that is waiting for results. Please fix this. Thank you.
"Recently updated s8 software and the Samsung health app that was working perfectly now refuses to open. All I get are Non stop messages re:"" unauthorized changes were made to your phone"". For the record I have never ever rooted my phone!!!!"
"Can't detect steps correctly! If it's not the only Health app to sync to my AIA vitality I would have deleted in a second! I have my default Health app installed in my phone and compare to the two this Samsung Health can only detect not even half of my steps! Redicouls! I tried deleted it and reinstall as advised by my insurance agent, but it turn out the same! üëéüëéüëé"
Really loved this app when I got my Samsung Gear watch. Now they took away the setting to just count my steps on my watch I hate it. have no idea of how many steps I have taken. My phone stays with me most of the time. With that my steps are counted twice. How is the even logical. So I have stopped keeping track of my steps all together. I spent $400 on the watch for nothing. Only thing the watch is good for is keeping track of my sleep and telling times. A Fitbit would have been cheaper.üò°
"Phone for 1k and they display ads on half of the screen. Disgusting. After the update no way to see stats of weight (they never were ux friendly but now they are completely gone). You can't add ""other"" workout."
Further Update: I appreciate your response now recognising this issue but this has been ongoing for over a month. Please push the update out soon!! Update: Your suggestion to clear the cache did not work. My battery is still being drained quickly by your app. I have followed up with an email. Hopefully you send out an update to fix soon. Why is Samsung health draining about 15-20% of my battery daily on the pixel 6 pro. This has happened recently after the recent updates. Please fix Samsung.
"Disappointed, the new update forces me to allow app access to contacts. There's no reason for this as the way I used to use it. There should be options. As reported access is ""only for implementing app features"". I don't use the app to contact anyone any where. So the Features, has made this app useless to me, if I am required to share access to my contact list, phone etc. Again, users should have the option to disable the access/request. What are the reasons that the app needs access.... what are the functions/features that depended on having access."
"Not very good , I recently bought a new Samsung phone and then I learned that the galaxy active 2 was able to take blood pressure readings , I already have a fitbit , but the idea of reading my blood pressure persuaded me to buy the Samsung watch . I installed the appropriate app , but it does not work for me it keeps telling me to take the reading with a cuff , if I had a cuff , why would I get the watch ? So I bought a watch that doesn't do what I bought it for . Even the heart rate stats are not nearly as detailed as the fitbit . These shortcomings are very disappointing , it really puts me off technology because the claims made by some don't always work in reality ."
"Works well, step counting continues with the phone while watch is on charge. VO¬≤Max would be nice. One problem, it stopped tracking sleep stages suddenly on the 17th August, probably after an update."
"The calorie count is way off. I turn my phone on in the morning after it not only being off all night, but it's not even moved, and it says I have burned various amounts of calories. And walking the active count is way off also. Please review, thank you."
"Brilliant app!! Has allowed me to track walking, sleep, count calories and keep track of my weight. Simple easy to use and absolutely free! Hands down the best. Wish I could add more food items to calories counting- but that's all. Lost 5kg using this app. Love it!!"
"I loved this app until the new update and new phone. No I do not think this app needs to make phone calls. Only thing it should have access to is location and maybe camera. Second my S7 grashed and only data I have is from 2017. I just got an S21 but There is also no access to the button to check heart rate, heart stress, or O2 levels anymore. Really disappointed."
Love the app. Use it daily. But PLEASE GET BACK THE FEATURES YOU TOOK OUT. I really miss showing weight tracking by week month and year with min max and average. It helps me stay on track and better average out daily weight fluctuations.
"Loved the app. But not giving the app permission to make calls on my behalf. That is literally what it told it wants to fo. Samsung, you can give the song and dance about how it's supposed to benefit us and make the app better, but honestly, no, you don't need to make phone calls on behalf. You might want to reconsider this latest update, obviously I am not the only one unhappy."
Wish they add a Google map showing the routes taken just like Strava. Also would be ideal to have options to have other people seeing my workout and vice versa. I like the app but I use it hand in hand with strava as I like the map function o Strava
"Awful since the latest update, can no longer use a chest strap to monitor heart rate during strenuous exercise. The watch can't keep up. Looks like I'll be throwing the whole thing in the garbage. Junk!!! After talking to these idiots there was no resolution. They can't even speak English. Stay far, far away from this app unless you want to do strenuous exercise while having no idea what your heart rate is."
"Since i updated the app it keeps just closing out and stopping. Especially when i try to click on ""for you"" to read the notifications. Also i accepted 2 challenges today and as soon as i accepted them one person was already to 20000 steps and the other person was already to about 14,000..... thought step count didn't start until the challenge was accepted? So far not liking the update"
"Terrible app. Spent a lot of money on the watch, and the app tells me they're synced but no data transfers over, and the watch always tells me it can't open the app. Tried clearing data, reinstalling and resetting the watch. Garbage, I won't be buying Samsung Watches again..."
"Battery killer acts like spyware. Permissions are not worth it and it looks a lot like Spyware !. Permissions exceed to""implement your features& provide optimal user baloney"" all of which worked BETTER before . . This is an unimproved app. You've created a very UNoptimal experience.Your responses lack sincerity."
"Great app to track all your activities, health parameters and nutrient intake. However, it is very US focused and as someone from the EU (the Netherlands) it is frustrating that I need to add all my own food items. This is very discouraging, as it takes a lot of time, and to make matters worse, you are only allowed to add 100 custom meals. Why impose such a limit? And why can other apps, such as my fitnesspal, manage to have dutch food items in their database, while Samsung cannot?"
"Since the latest update, my Samsung Galaxy Active 2 watch doesnt sync with the Samsung Health app. The steps arent being tracked accurately in the app and my sleep isnt being tracked, although they are on my watch. So disappointing!"
They should've invested a litte more time into making this app. Almost a waste of time to use. Helpful for basic info but that's it. You can't add in extra workouts successfully and the steps are way off base.
"love the app but not the update. All the micronutrient data shows 0g in the daily recommended portion of the actual vs recommended table. I also wish there was ability to shift daily recommended carb% for diabetic management, or even a sugar sub category like with fiber to get an at a glance 'rapid carb/slow carb/fiber' daily picture."
Generally works great but there is always issues with GPS Seems App sample GPS once a while rather tracking it constantly. Then at the end my run looks on map like I was running straight between points not related at all to the actual roads I ran on. Is this some kind of a bug...??
"Why does my review keep going missing?? This used to be a great app, now half of the features don't work or don't work properly. It no longer records my ECG's an all prior recordings have disappeared. Please help!"
"Every time I try to accept the new terms I get an error. Hit ok and it closes the app. Completely useless. Edit: 3* now, uninstall and reinstall worked for me. Still annoying to have to reconnect to Strava every time there's an update though."
"I used to LOVE this app. The latest update removed syncing days with 3rd party apps, so it no longer syncs my workouts to My Fittness Pal. This is s MAJOR hit to my using the app. Honestly, it was what was keeping me from buying a better fitness tracking watch. What a step backwards!"
"Fix update: phone settings, search animation, disable 'remove animations'. That what customer service needs to tell. Update: so I get a useless reply to my request in the initial post: contact customer service. How about Samsung people who reply - - you are the customer service and my post is direct complaint. Initial Post 2 stars. Please fix the breathing exercise sub-app. It doesn't show inhale or exhale progress. It used to be a ring, but someone took it away?"
"I don't like the two step verification. Step challenge, not interested. Together feature possibly illegal in my country. Further I don't see why I should surrender any phone number to get to login. To turn it into a social media motivater combo, what a waste, put it in another app. Can someone recommend an alternative app please? All the people I'd meet if the files app received the same treatment. S10plus."
Can't do stress measure with measure double selected. Spo2 won't work. App keeps crashing when this is selected. When not selected it will measure stress fine without crashing. Maybe the spo2 has no where to display causing the crash. Tried clearing storage and reinstalling with no avail.
"Uninstalled. You do not need access to my phone calls or contacts list in order for me to monitor my health. It does not help ""optimize"" my user experience. Don't both copying and pasting your general response. I'm just here to give you a low rating. Wish I could give you zero stars. Edit: Wow. It's like you didn't even read where I said don't bother copying and pasting your general response. *sarcasm*"
"App went from a 5 star to a 1 star with this latest update. I am a disabled veteran and I used the trends feature (days, weeks, months) to track my health (and report to my Doctor), but this feature is no longer available. Instead samsung appears to have changed this app to cater to people who want to compete against others. If this is you, you may love the update, but if you want an app to help you keep track of your own personal health this one is severely limited."
"The tracking functions are good when paired with the galaxy watch. The workout videos are not very useful, and have inappropriate gender stereotypes (to me it seems the two are related)."
"Great app. But Samsung decided that to use it, you have to set up 2 step authentication and provide a phone number. I already paid for the phone that came with the app, now they want to sell my data for more profit in order to use it. After being a dedicated Samsung user, it may be the last Samsung I own. I should be able to use the device that I paid for and the apps that came with it, without needing to keep providing unnecessary personal information."
"I really like the Samsung Health App. And easy to use. You pick the exercise, customize it to fit your needs, and then, hit start. It counts your steps, measures your heart rate, oxygen leaves, etc."
"I loved this app. But they keep stripping features from it and now with the removal of the calorie counter and caffeine counters, im actually selling my Active Watch 2 and switching to FitBit. Nobody wants to use several different apps to do what a single app should be able to."
"I keep getting a network error despite having good internet. Pls help. I am unable to use the app because of this. It says check network and try again. I have updated the app, reinstalled it and given it permission and all but still wont work. It works on my watch 4 classic though. I need urgent assistance"
"Literally turned a $200 health/smart watch into a $20 step counter with one update. Used to be able to measure stress and O2, which my wife and I used to watch our asthma, along with other apps.... gone. To use the ECG, you have to use a separate app. Now, I use it to count steps. I could have saved $180 and bought a $20 step counter. Disappointed. Not an apple person, but much better product."
No more continuous heart rate graph with update. Now it just shows bars of high/low rates for a period of time. The continuous graph was much more useful to me. Definitely a downgrade. Disappointed.
"Update August 2020. What happened? I bought a Samsung watch specifically for use with this app and it was spot on, giving me all the information I needed to monitor my health issues. Until yesterday when the latest ""update"" was installed. It's now useless to me and I cannot get back the monitoring which I had come to rely on. Please Samsung have a good look at fixing the app. There's no point in just giving a contact number in the USA, we don't all live there you know..."
Started off great but recently it is hit and miss. Some days it captures the real number of steps and other days it captures 20 to 25 percent of steps. Just installed another pedometer app which is consistent unlike the Samsung health app. Hopefully someone will read my review and act upon it to resolve the inconsistentcy issue.
"In the 8/52020 update, the caffeine and daily calorie trackers were removed? Why? This app has become less useful over the past year. 9/28/2020 update. I no longer use this app. The removed features, that we never restored, make it useless for me. I've moved on to another app. It's not worth my time to us this any longer. I reduced the rating to one star because it won't let me give it zero stars."
"Complete garbage app. It is not syncing my sleep, steps from Galaxy Watch. There is no way to refresh watch data manually, if it feels like then it detects otherwise, 'come tomorrow'. I turned on continuous heart rate but can't see continuous heartrate, its just some dots per hous that's it.. What is the use in case I have to analyze certain activity on heart rate? I wanted to build Samsung eco but that is of no use I guess as the app is complete thrash."
"Giving this one star purely and directly as a result of a recent update now requesting permissions to make phone calls. This was not necessary before and is not necessary now. Interestingly it still appears to run in the background counting my daily steps, but then doesn't allow me to go any further unless I give the application permissions to make phone calls. The stock reply I see from Samsung on other user reviews explains this is for ""providing an optimal experience"". This is frankly not good enough. There should be the option of opting out of this and accepting it might not be as optimal as Samsung say it would otherwise be. In your next update Samsung, please make this an opt in choice, not a new forced condition."
I have tried to register with Samsung for months. Its recognises my email but refuses to accept my password and have reset it several times. My phone on this app is not the correct one and I don't know how to change it. The Wear app is good but it's not monitoring several functions and won't do so until I can sign in to Samsung which I can't because it won't allow me. Please help.
"Pretty good overall. I am coming from Fitbit, which has a very nice community with different group options. I do miss that. It makes the competitive experience feel more personal and connected."
"Apparently a workout does not include digging post-holes, setting posts, stretching fence, trimming trees, dragging limbs and piling them up. Nor does it include building a raised bed garden, moving 3 tons of dirt, sand, and composted manure using only a shovel and wheelbarrow. Not to mention everything else which I do to make this place a home."
Very disappointed with the last update. Removing the weight management feature was a poor choice. It was the only reason I use the app. I will have to look elsewhere for a weightloss app.
"No. Why do you need to manage calls to use a fitness app? I paid $350 for the watch and use this app to monitor my sleep. Absolutely no reason to force permissions. Updates keep making this app worse by removing features. If the permissions are only for features, then just have those features not work without the permissions. No reason to force permissions for something we probably won't even use. I can't think of a single feature in a fitness app that needs access to manage calls."
"The watch app is rolling over the day's progress at 8 PM while the phone app works correctly. 9/25/20 Back in early August, Samsung decided to completely ruin any utility this app may have had by removing the calorie management widget. Now it's just a reskinned excel spreadsheet."
"Just updated, went to weigh in. shows weight on dashboard, but Does not show weight in weight record section where it shows daily weight. Tried manual and accessory scale, both acted same. Have rebooted device. after next updates, issue was resolved."
"Just want to use this app to track steps, heart rate, and workout data. I have no desire to challenge friends and family, but Samsung thinks that is what's best for me so it no longer lets me use the app if I won't let it make phone calls? Not sure what that has to do with my health. Should change name of app to Samsung Big Brother."
"This is an edit of my previous 5 star review. I gave it 3 bc it's still functional, but the Food section has totally been altered for the worse, the negative calorie counter is gone, and the graphics are in the toilet. Whomever you hired, promoted, and used to ""upgrade"" the app should be fired. Did you go to the lowest bidder? There is a reason that all of your reviews are terrible since your last upgrade. This needs to be fixed soon or you can count another that is going to jump ship."
"Having migrated from Garmin Connect, I'm very disappointed. There's no way of expanding a graph to full screen. You cannot analyse graph data (e.g. check a specific data point). There's no web site to view the data in a browser on a laptop. A bit of an edge case, but I went to sleep at 2120 last night and woke up at 0520 and it incorrectly reports that I only slept for 5h17m. That appears to be because I went to the loo between 2359 and 0003, so the first part of the sleep is logged against yesterday and the latter part logged against today."
"I love it! It's a great way to keep track of your steps and the time you sleep! I think it's a very smart app, but there is one problem, sometimes when im driving it counts steps now and then, please fix that :)"
"Disappointed. At the rate of removing beneficial ""health"" features, might as well rename the app itself. I am a loyal Samsung consumer/fan and will not purchase any other brand. I upgraded to Samsung Note 10+ and Galaxy Active 2 last yr. As a healthcare worker, I'm incredibly disappointed the O2 capability was removed and now the diabetes wellness. Please for the love of goodness, stop removing ""health"" capabilities. Bring back the features!!!"
"Giving a 5 star rating as this app along with my watch, keeps me updated on my activities, heart rate, calories intake and burned while active. As of this date, I have not experienced any problems. Only thing that I wish is in the meal section, when picking cereal for breakfast, is to add what kind of milk was used. I drink 1% milk. All I saw was one choice of the cereal I eat was with skim milk. Please upgrade different types of foods and drinks that may be used with the meal. Otherwise, thanks"
"They removed the SPO2 standalone measuring option, which is very disappointing. I want to measure my oxygen levels independently. Edit: Now Samsung has completely removed the heart rate monitoring ability of the phone altogether. Absolutely ridiculous."
"I really enjoyed this app until the latest update requiring additional, unreasonable permissions like access to phone and contacts. Since I can't access the app now w/o allowing the new permissions, which I will never allow, it's basically useless and will be uninstalled as soon as I finish this review. Nice job developers! Watch the one star review bar grow! More importantly, my Samsung Active 2 watch also just became far less useful without this app, so I'll be looking for a different brand."
"You removed the most important feature! How could you remove the Weight Management section of this app!? Surely this was a silly decision by Samsung! I'd love to know the thought process of your designers in the meeting. ""let's take out the main feature of the app and make it less user friendly!"" Loved this app before, you've just destroyed it completely."
"With the new update, whenever I want to add a workout or edit a blood glucose reading it now crashes. Never did that before and my doctor and I are not impressed by this issue at all. Please fix this problem. Still not fixed, but at least samsung is trying to get it resolved"
"No joke this is one of the reasons I preffer Android. I love this app. The collaboration with other apps for sports videos and meditations is supreme. The options to do challenges with other Samsung users is extremely nice too, I would love to see more of that. I love the sleep / workouts / weight tracking and the accuracy. It makes me motivated and eager to each my goals. I love S Health. My gym and healthy lifestyle coach. Thank you ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è"
"I used to love the Samsung health app. Not anymore. Can't use it because of the permissions. I'm not giving my permission under any circumstance for things I would never use it for. If Samsung can let you use the app without the intrusive permissions I'll use it again. Like I already said, I used to love them. Now the only way they will get a better review from me is to let me use the app without the permissions. Makes me want to leave Samsung all together. üò©"
"I got an s20+ and the update doesn't have a feature to measure pulse or stress, How unfortunate. I'm not sure how well this calculates calories from resting metabolic rate. Also, the food is recorded from Fat Secret, notorious for not having a record of nutrients in food such as iron, calcium, vitamin a, vitamin c, etc. I really wish they would invest into recording vitamins for total health. Tracking water, weight and food is otherwise easy. And basic exercises can be recorded as well."
What the ....? Why is Samsung all of a sudden requiring access to Android Phone functionality. This was not required prior to April 2021. REFUSING to use this app until that setting is removed. UPDATE: Your copy/paste response to this issue is not changing my mind. You have a real issue on your hands and you know it by reading the 1 Star reviews. You might want to consider reversing your security and privacy changes before you lose all users who care about their privacy.
"So far I love this app and it's gotten me more active in the first two weeks alone. As a suggestion, I would love to see badges of accomplishment. Ex.. x number of steps in a day (high numbers), getting over your daily goals x time in a row, x number of wins in challenges, etc.."
I can no longer select weekly or monthly trend views for weight - it only shows daily. Is this a design change or a bug? Both Steps and Activity time have longer term trend analysis options so why does this no longer apply for Weight? It's frustrating as I used it for weight management.
"Generally great, easy sync of data from samsung watch, understandable screens and lots to track and/or expand on such as calorie counter etc however had to uninstall and reinstall today as app would not open. Took 3 attempts to re install."
"This is a good app. My only problem is that you can't enter custom recipes and set number of servings, I cook at home alot and bent able to enter a whole recipe and number of servings aahs have the ago do the math for me is very helpful. This app would be 5 stars if you added this feature. Unfortunately I will have to use another app which does include it."
"Great app for tracking your health but I wish I could track more about my health like bowel movements urine and other things about my body like external diseases on feet and head as well as other places, have it all collected in one app for next time you see the doctor and even better if you could get it on your Galaxy wearable."
"I can't access the app now since I must give it access to my phone calls, and I don't want to. This is absolutely rediculous that a health app wants access to calls. Fix it before I drop this app forever. Reply: in that case, just disable the ‚Äútogether feature‚Äú if I don't give the permission to my calls, but don't disabled the whole app. I'll give it another week for hopefully an update before I delete the app."
I used to like checking this app. After the last update it keeps telling me that it cant run on a rooted phone. My phone is not rooted. I even went to AT&T to have my phone checked. I see in another review that you can call a 1800 number to get assistance. Just how i want to spend my time! I'm deleting now. Oh well maybe I will find another one similar.
Since the update the app does not always open. It attempts to and then closes. Yet another app update yet another issue. Now it won't update with my watch at all! I guess I will have to delete and lose all of my data again and reinstall!
"Used to absolutely love this app, has been essentially non-functional since Feb 6 update...not the first update that seriously screwed up recorded data & synching ability. Great when it works, but doesn't work nearly often enough!"
I am using this app since 2 years and it is very helpful for me in my weight loss journey. It had a feature to show the difference between calorie intake and calories burnt during work out can you please add that feature again .
"Not always an accurate distance is shown in this app while running, even when the gps is turned into highest accuracy mode in my s10. @Samsung: expecting for a correction in the app to count the accurate distance/steps during workouts."
"The Heart Rate, Blood Oxygen and Stress level tools show totally different readings for HR and O2. This is for the same individual with checks done one after another without pauses. That is not good. The Blood Oxygen tool shows a 51 BPM and then right after that, the HR tool shows 61. The O2 tool shows 96% and right after that the Stress Level tool show 100% oxygenation. You need to get that fixed."
So disappointing. I have used this app for years and now can't even open without giving an insane amount of permissions. I appreciate that Samsung needs our data for additional features but not everyone wants all of those features and that level of invasion shouldn't be required to use the app. Give people the choice to opt in or out even if it adjusts the features available to them. People deserve the right to decide what information they choose to share. Samsung used to respect that.
"I have been using Samsung Health for the last 4 years now and have found it a great way to track my steps, exercise and sleep. My app updated on the 5th of October and since then has not been keeping record of my daily step count. My October average is now down the drain! Any suggestions on how i can fix this problem? If not i will have to find another app to use and start all over again"
There seems to be a feature missing that is available in the US but not north of the border in Canada. Samsung health monitor...blood pressure and ECG feature. Why is it not available? I have heard that Samsung has been dancing around this issue for past year or so. Any explanation for this? For the time being this app gets 1 star. I would give it a 0 if I could.
"Reply to Samsung Health: No thanks, if it is not used for anything other than your explanation, it does not need to be mandatory to accept in order to use the app. Your app is not essential. Change in terms means that unless you allow access to phone functionality, you are not able to use the app. The ""user experience"" response is frankly stupid, and I reject it. Try another on when responding to me. It is Unnecessary and Invasive. Have uninstalled. Next phone will not be Samsung at this rate."
Love the app until you wanted to make calls. There is no need for that function as the app was just fine. Please let me disable that feature and still use the app. I don't really want to search for a new app and lose all my information on this app. This new permission is going to make you lose many current users who don't see the necessity of the new permission to be enabled for use of something everyone was happy with. That permission does not enhance any use.
"Love your watches and app but since I pulled latest update few days ago, steps and daily activity don't sync. And my watch keeps keeps disconecting. I have to restart my watch multiple times a day so my steps could sync. But my activity doesn't sync at all. Before I pulled latest update everythnig worked awsome!"
"Unfortunately this app is not reliable, my app is on day 10 of not properly tracking my sleep, steps, or anything else for that matter and this is the 2nd time I'm dealing with this issue. Tried reaching out for help and was just referred to an 800 number which I haven't had time to call (typing this from a meeting), there has to be a better way to get help."
"I love this app but I can't get it to work on my new phone. It keeps telling me my session is expired and to sign in, but when I click sign in, it tells me there's an error and to try again, but nothing happens. I've even synced it and it just keeps giving me the error."
"My gear fit2 has never counted stairs correctly (10x or more wrong?!?!). Now, after the latest update, the heart rate monitor doesn't work at all. The update looks better, but it did seem to break the HR feature."
"I love this app but it's seriously frustrating when this app will not integrate with other apps other than strava. SAMSUNG, NOT ALL OF US ARE RUNNERS! PLEASE at least make a way to sync Google fit data over from apps that integrate with them or to integrate with fitness apps again! Love this app but this is seriously frustrating!"
"Mediocre app, unacceptable request for permissions. It used to be decent then they broke a few key things for me. I set it aside for a while and now that I'm back it won't let me use it unless I accept a completely ridiculous amount of control over MY phone. Several people have already mentioned this, seems to me Samsung should take this criticism to heart. Update 4-20-2022. I tried it again and now it doesn't even seem to complete syncing with my (samsung) watch. Is this abandoneware?"
"Since I can't review the widget alone. I recently started using the widget again. My question is, what happened to the widget that gave a wide overview of the app? There is only a step counter now. Either a white or black background square with a number in it. I've looked around the app to configure the widget. If I long press the widget to configure,it shows me the weather channel. What is the point of only viewing steps when the app offers more than a step counter? Useless, very blend, widget."
"Terrible app. New update has frozen in permission. Seems that it wants to snoop on users and denying that permission ended up in a closed loop where I can't use the App at all. 1 is generous - I will give it -5, if I could!üò° The developer has now responded - thank you. I am not reassured. The T&Cs mention that the data can be held in servers outside UK, e.g. in South Korea, where the standards of protection may be different. I have to allow the App to control my Phone etc, which to me, in the absence of GDPR and encryption protection, is a Snooper's Charter! Not reassured!"
"In response to the developer: Optimal experience is still ZERO reason to need access to contacts & phone calls. In this age of endless hacks, no one else sees it today, but tomorrow is a different story. So my work around for now, was to grant permission to get back into the app and then revoke permission. Might be time to look around for a new fitness app."
"Worked great, until it didn't. One day it just decided to not register any data from MyFitnessPal which is much better for entering data about foods. Following guides on how to fix the issue did nothing for me. Next step will be to just unistall if some update does not fix the issue soon because it is just irritating."
"I used to like this app. My entire family would do challenges. However, now I have to allow Samsung Health access to my phone calls and all my contacts. If I want to connect to one of my contacts then I will add them. I DON'T need Samsung to decide who I want to connect to. It was interesting that on April 5, Samsung Health updated their privacy policy saying ""they respect your concerns about privacy"" but I have to give Health access to my phone and contacts. Since I am unable to reply to Samsung's comment, I will have to add to my original comment. Even if Samsung's response was true that it to make the implication of the app features more enjoyable, why is it that Samsung has decided how I want to use the app and requires that i add all of my contacts and phone calls to the app. If I wanted to use the app that way, I would have already connected those features. I am opposed to Samsung deciding that I have to have all of my contacts in a step counting app. If Samsung was concerned with the privacy of their customers, they would let the customer decide what information that the customer wants to share with the app. The app worked fine before this update. The customer was able to add those features that they wanted. However, now they have looked the customer out unless they agree to give up control of what information that they want to provide to the app. Please remove the requirement that I must share my phone and contacts with Samsung Health."
"Update 25Feb19: The pedometer part of this app seems to have lost all sensitivity, I seem to be doing half as many steps as my smart watch counts, even when I'm holding my phone in the same hand as my smart watch! I tested this when going for a 15 minute walk, and it failed abysmally. Can the pedometer sensitivity be altered in app? I just want it to be closer to accurate, not overly generous."
"Used to be a great app. It would even tell you when you got to a healthy pace while walking without having to guess. Now, not only does it not tell you that, but sometimes you can walk for more than ten minutes before the app realizes you're actually walking. Case in point, I just finished a 33 minute walk, but the app said that I only walked for 23 minutes."
"Switched to 4 from a FitBit Versa 2 weeks ago. I have tiny wrists. This thing is HUGE on me, impossible to sleep in it. Would love a smaller face & lower profile. App has some excellent features, but are lacking compared to FitBit. Food tracking doesn't have scan or deficit options. Step count is off - Tested using FitBit on other wrist. HR & SpO2 readings all over the place but could be huge watch face on tiny wrist. Overall good, but expected more from Samsung and for the $$$."
"Why do I need to give you permission to have access to phone calls with this privacy update? I've been using this app for years, but now, I will find another app. Shame on you Samsung Health.(Reply to your comment: You're missing the point, the point is you don't need to access call data to perform Health Functions. I've uninstalled this app, and switched back to Google Fit.)"
"Good, but lacking common sense inputs. My biggest problem with this app is that the measurements are in grams no matter what you pick for most items and the actual serving size is lost. Like instead of 13 pieces it'll say just 33 grams. Well sorry Samsung, that's not helpful. Your target audience is people who don't think I'm grams. Otherwise its good. Offers features you'd have to pay for in my fitness pal. It's not going motivate you with articles and stuff though, but a good manual tracker"
"This app. Has complimented and catalyzed my health management routines. At first I carried a mobile device to view, manually track, and accompany me throughout my exercises. Now! I added a Samsung watch and the Buds Live. All this created an atmosphere or should I say, "" ecosystem,"" of mindfulness, self-compassion, and true health measurement. I'm not bothered at all about the notifications that I should swim, bike, run, and drink water because that is how I tailored my personal experience. TY"
It used to be wonderful until they updated & removed the heart rate and oxygen functions. Now it's useless. Absolutely worthless. Now I have to find another app to replace it. What's wrong with you Samsung?! Trying to force the purchase of a watch shows your greed.
"I used to enjoy using this app to track my health, but the developers insist on messing it up. You can no longer edit custom meals, the water intake feature doesn't work correctly, it is harder to enter daily food intake, the sensors no longer work unless you want to buy more samsung gadgets to monitor them. And before you suggest that I turn on the autosync feature, I refuse to share my personal health information to third parties, ESPECIALLY South Korea! I give this app - 5"
"(I got a reply from Samsung, stating the phone permissions is required to verify unique device identifier for the together feature. This does not explain why with an app made to track physical activity and provide health information, why you wouldn't have physical activity be the required permission, and phone permission be optional. And if you don't want to grant it, that's fine you would just have some limited functionality and not be able to use the together feature."
"For some reason, the app crashes when I look up previous workouts. I suspect it may have something to do with the Google maps feature. Makes it real hard to track workouts."
Really unhappy with the latest change that messed up the sleep data. Really miss the graphing. I cleared the cache and did a force stop and restarted the phone. This is a problem with the app. Will you be fixing it?
"As of this morning, 15 January 2021, without warning, the Weight Trends feature appears to have been removed. Therefore you can only see a single line chart of daily weights which means that instead of being able to scroll quickly to your average weight for any given month in your history and then find all your daily weights for that month laid out vertically, the only thing you can do is scroll blindly from day to day. Ther edit feature has been removed and you can't go to a particular date."
"I like this app much better than Fitbit. It's very intuitive and accurate in most ways. I just wish you could edit times in a sleep record. My Galaxy Watch keeps recording that I'm sleeping at night while I'm feeding my baby, so my recorded sleep times are not accurate at all. Kind of frustrating."
App was alright until recently. It keeps on crashing now and on the battery usage setting page it shows that app was active less than a minute and yet it used 29.5% of battery throughout the night (phone was not used during the night at all).
"I'm using a Galaxy4 watch on a Google Pixel 4XL I use the fitness programs and it's doing amazing job in starting the workout However, once the workout finish, the watch will disconnect from the phone and no way to get it back connected except by restarting the watch!"
"0 stars, there's absolutely no reason why this app needs access to my phone or my call logs. I've been a loyal customer for 14 years. I've went back an forth between the note series and the S series and at this point I'd rather NOT HAVE A PHONE than watch a company I used to respect sink even further than anyone thought possible. Congratulations, you've ruined a great thing"
"Been loving Samsung Health for two years but the latest update has removed so many great features and made the app a sad shadow of what it was. And where is all my old data? And is the stress monitor broken or have I died and just not realised it yet? I see dead apps, and they don't know they're dead !! Updated to only one star... now all of my exercise data from over 30 days ago is systematically disappearing each day. What's the point of me saving data if you delete or hide it? Where is it? Do you think I'm only interested in the last month of my training? FFS !!"
"After an update, the app now requires to give permission to the phone to work at all ... Why? it worked well enough before without this permission. Data collection is not necessary to monetise users when we already paid for the phone, android and the Samsung layer. I'll look into alternatives."
"This worked with my old Motorola Z play phone, but it does not work with my Motorola stylus 5G. Every time I try to sign in with the app, it hangs until Android OS gives up on it. I have uninstalled it. Well my phone is new to me, it's old enough to be a freebie on T-mobile. This tells me that Samsung is not supporting its app long enough to expect this to be fixed, so I'm giving up on Samsung."
"it' s one of the best health apps that I have ever used. it has workouts you can download you can moniter things like your bpm, blood glucose, blood pressure, coffee intake, water intake, your weight and so much more. the only problem i see that this app has is alot of users aren't using it enough so if your someone who works retail walking around alot stocking items and such your pretty much automatically in the top 13% for steps. I guess that isn't bad it makes you feel better about yourself."
"When I use cycling basic workout mode, the app can't detect location properly. I have to hold the phone and keep the app on the screen to make the app work. It did not happened in the previous version. Please fix this.."
"First of very all, the app is awesome. Cheers to the developers. The reason why I am rating it as 3 star is that currently the app counts the diatance as our steps even when we are travelling by vehicle...I have seen many apps not counting the steps for travelling by vehicle e.g. app in apple i-phone. My humble request and suggestion to the developers is that they need to programme the app as per above requirement or tell me the way how i can use the app differently to resolve this issue. Ty"
"UninstalIed it now, I used this App all the time but I refuse to give it permission to manage my calls and contacts, don't reply with""Optimal experience"" nonsense, Samsung has no need or right to my phone calls in a fitness app, I was a sucker and have the watch and phone, I think I have given Samsung enough. Time to end my brand loyalty. Pathetic response from the App team, they never even read my post just a copied and pasted that response, excellent customer support from Samsung üò°üò°üò°üò°!"
"Fantastic in every way. The only improvement would be a more improved food searching system; with that being said, this app already has one of the largest and most intuitive databases I've ever used."
"UPDATE!!!!!! I reinstalled the app with the hopes it would work now the heart rate monitor and stress level is working again! Thank you! I use to love this app and now the heart rate sensor wont work without the watch. I feel like I look stupid in those watches and my wrists look fat when I wear them. Now I have no way to monitor my stress levels. I am so disappointed, as I suffer from racing heart beats and this app was instrumental in my ability to breathe my way through it. üò¢"
"Between this app and my Galaxy Active 2 watch, I'm getting back into shape. With a Family, Work, and Political Activism, it's hard to get some work outs in. I found a routine in here for my busy schedule, that's only between 4-8 minutes a day. That's easy to squeeze into a busy schedule. Keeping track of my pull up and push up progress too. I'm 45 going on 25 now. Lol."
App will not start due to incorrect permissions. Now cannot use this app without giving all my details to Samsung. Why do they need any information from this app? I do not want my health details stored off my phone. The response from Samsung is that it to 'Optimise app experience and will not be shared with any third parties'. NO. I don't want to share my data even with YOU Samsung!
Bought the galaxy watch 3 on launch with the idea it'd actually have all the features listed. Here we are galaxy watch 4 is out now and my 3 still doesn't have the promised blood pressure feature. All support has done is lie and tell me it's a few weeks or few days away. I dropped them and went with garmin and couldn't be happier.
"Tracking stats on more micronutrients/minerals/vitamins from diet would be good eg the various vitamin Bs, magnesium etc.. also need more food selection especially Asian dishes.. pls check accuracy of sleep tracker using watch 4.. Also, remove all the foods from the list with zero vitamins and micronutrients.. its a hassle filtering and selecting.. would be good to add ketone and uric acid levels in addition to existing glucose level"
"Really liked the app. Really used it to check my pulse oxygen level, heart rate, and stess. Now all of the sudden none of these features work. Ive tried to fix it but still won't work. So to me there is no point to this app anymore."
"It needs more options for when you share your workouts. I wanna see my path i took while running, and I wanna see my pace. I don't wanna see the distance and the time it took to run that. Cause then I gotta do math to figure out my average pace? Naaaahh.. just gimme pace, distance, time and my GPS tracked path all in one simple to share post.. I'm switching back to Runkeeper. It's superior in every way."
"After the latest update, the app no longer measures stress or heart rate. The sensor in the camera does not come on and it just keeps saying to place your finger on the sensor and be still. Please fix this. Otherwise, the app is useless to me."
"S10 can no longer rate heart, stress, etc...since the latest update. I cleared the cache and made sure app is still active, then rebooted, but red light not coming on and app not functioning....update: also ran a diagnostic on this device and report is everything is ok, but Samsung Health doesn't work."
"Had it for a long time, it was a good app, the ads were annoying but were relatively unobtrusive. Then it required unreasonable permissions, (phone calls? No way) so I had to Uninstall it. Developers need to learn that doesn't fly anymore. EDIT: At least Samsung gave me a pseudo explanation and not their boilerplate answer they gave the rest of the reviewers. But its still unacceptable and I'm not coming back."
"The original Samsung Health app lets you check your blood pressure, by placing your finger on the light sensor on the back of the phone. The new Samsung health App does not have a option to check your blood pressure. I just uninstalled Samsung health app, will no longer be using it, and the app doesn't even deserve one star."
"Having trouble with the ""floors"" tracker. I get out of bed and walk around my one level house getting ready for work and about 30 minutes in, I get congratulates for hitting my 10 floor goal. By the end of the day I'm hitting like 200 plus floors some days when I haven't even hit a flight of stairs or walked up a hill. Thoughts? I love this app."
Hi Samsung Team. I am unable to connect link the Omron App with Samsung Health App. This was possible in the previous version of the Omron App. I followed the instructions in the app but I am unable to activate the app permissions. I am using a Samsung Galaxy phone. Can you please help fix this. I raised the issue and it was fixed in 24 hours. I have since then changed my rating. Great job Samsung.
"Overall I like the app, but it could be better. Bugs: - In achievements, ""Personal bests"" are not up to date / some date is not taken into account. It looks like ""running coach"" data is being ignored. Feature requests: - Export GPX data should include heart rate data. - A website to review health data and workouts would be nice. - More options for running coaches: - Interval training coach. - Heart rate coach (target heart rate / zone not speed) In general I'm happy with my Active2 watch and the app, but there is always room for improvement. Keep up the great work and I hope you take my recommendations / requests into account. Thank you and have a nice day. :)"
I love this app. I particularly love the challenges. It inspires me that I am part of a global community aiming to achieve health and wellness. Being competitive it helps keep me focused and motivated. Only disappointment is those who somehow manipulate it to increase their Steps. There is no way you can do 300k Steps in 1-2 days and maintain that day after day...
"App was really good, update just came out. I prefer Strava, and can only pull info over using a 3rd party app Health Sync. This pulls info from Samsung health to Strava. After yesterday's update, health sync is no longer pulling info over. Would be great to get an update with that fix."
"Stops counting my steps for no reason-and no-it isn't because I have my phone in a bag or what-have-you. It's in my pocket at all times. I called the customer service number, went through the usual steps (restart phone, leave it off for 2 min, clear cache) it worked for a couple of hours and now it is back to NOT counting my steps!!!"
App works fine when it's not constantly updating. Every time it updates it freezes my phone for at least 15 minutes and makes it lag. It updates whenever it wants even with automatic updating turned off. Highly annoying.
"i love this app. my samsung s9 was broken and i had to switch to something else for a little. luckily i was still able to keep up with tracking my weight loss. i downloaded this app, logged in and everything was still there! perfect"
Looking at all the comments I will not be updating to the latest version as it appears to be broken. My husband also just got a new galaxy watch and he can't even set up an account because the verify button for 2 step verification is broken! Fix your app!! The 'quick fixes' you are giving these people for these issues won't work if the code is broken.
"I too was a happy user of this app. Then following some update, the app wants permission to make and manage my phone calls. No thank you. I won't use this app & may even delete it if things don't change. I have read the generic response to comments similar to mine. Listen to us, and respect our privacy. I'm disappointed, I will wait to see if this changes, if it doesn't, ah well maybe it's time to move on from Samsung ü§∑üèø‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
Used it for years on all my Samsung phones. One of my favourite features. Now it wants permission to my phone calls. It doesn't need this? Its counting my steps. It has permissions for nearly everything else but why would I give it permission for that? And I can't use the app without it. Guess I'll delete it and find new one.
"UPDATE: June 15/21-YOUR SUGGESTION DID NOT WORK! ü•∫ Update: Got yr email and am trying what you said. Thank you for your advice & help. UPDATE:June 11/21. Now this app keeps recording the wrong time of sleep/wake and sometimes doesn't record it at all and it states I have to do it manually! (how in the fak am I suppose to remember that, I downloaded this app so I wouldn't have to!!!)"
"I am giving your app no stars, the standard reply of : we will forward it to development team, and no action or feed back. Isn't acceptable. And now with 2021 update you need permission to access phone. The answer is NO. Even if it is for optimal experience, you must explain when and why you need this permission. It is obvious samsung don't care any more. ‚Äê‚Äê------------------ Old review :the best app to track activities, calories and nutrition , wish it can link to Moto 360"
"Please partner with Epic Systems MyChart. The app continues to show me content specifically for women when I clearly have male selected in my profile. No offense, but I don't need to see women-specific exercises and programs. It would also be very helpful if you guys could allow the app to see the ECG readings so that it's all right there in Samsung Health. I don't understand why it has to take you to a separate Health Monitor app."
"Using it on Samsung A51 5G and Galaxy Watch 1. After the One UI 4.0 update, app no longer syncs and all exercise data is no longer reachable. A notification pops up that the app syncing with watch, but notjing happens. A fix is greatly appreciated."
"The inability to edit or delete workouts manually is frustrating! My numbers are way off due to this. Could use more categories, Otherwise its a pretty decent tracker. Making suggestions via the contact us option is a joke."
"Why can't you see your total steps/miles per day, per week, per month in this app (or annual for that matter)!?!?!?! It's like the most basic information you'd want to see in order to track progress. I don't understand what I'm going to do with the ""average"" figures. Samsung, please just give me the RAW data!! And please allow for people to be able to compare year-to-year steps/miles/workouts. The apple watch does it. Come on."
The app sucks. All though I don't have a Samsung watch I wanted to use the app to compete with friends. I tried using third party apps to sync to help track my steps but you can no longer use third party apps to do this. I am not always able to have my phone in my hand to track my steps on my phone.
"Was a great app until the recent update. For whatever reason the update changed my calories burned for the same workout for the same duration of time. Completely messes up my calorie and exercise log, of which I've been using for years."
"Updated the app and lost 5 months of data. For some reason it has only saved to December and I had worked hard to track sleep/steps into a healthy cycle. Just really disheartening to now open the app and see no data, no badges since December and all of my trend graphs are gone üòÆ‚Äçüí®üò•"
Use to really like this app as it tracked how far I ran/walked. Now the widget is always saying updating and never appears to show how much I've ran. I run outside and I know by now the distance I need to go to run 4 or 6 miles but still I liked knowing I hit the goal. Yes you can go into the app and look but I'd much rather use the widget. It seems others have the same issue. You guys should fix this.
"Used to be great, but the background activity is draining my battery so much right now. On a day I don't use my phone much I end up with 50% of battery at the end of the day while Samsung Health used 20% of it. (Edit after two weeks: tha app uses 30% now. It REALLY doesn't play nice with Android 13, and I'm thing of deleting it unfortunately)"
"Samsung Health has been my go to app to measure and track my oxygen levels. It has corresponded to very closely to O2 levels done by hospitals. Until the recent update I have used it to track O2 over days, weeks, months. The update consolidated it w stress measurement and doesn't even show any past O2s during the same day. Very sad."
"I can't understand why this app needs to manage my phone calls ? There are contacts and there are phone calls. We can notice diference, right ? Privacy awful.. I have unistalled app this morning. It is now almost non-user friendly from my opinion. :) Try to fix things up. :) Year ago, this was the best app rated. I Can't understand why you let this app to be rated with one star ? Please take a look. Best regards !"
"This app is overall good. I like that it works well both if you want to use it independently and if you want to use it with friends. One thing I do wish this app would do, is be more friendly to shift workers. It would be nice if I could set what my awake and sleep hours actually are and have things tracked according to that instead of the default ""typical"" day."
"Who on the dev team thought it would be a *good* idea to lower the number of meals from six to four? A lot of people eat *more* than four times a day. I have to split my meals up to six a day to avoid eating disorder issues, otherwise I will massively undereat. Change it back to six meals, please. I used this app to track for almost five years."
"Very handy app for keeping track of your steps and giving you health stats. Only criticism is the accuracy of my cycle routes seems to depend on my speed, with the same route loosing or gaining a couple of hundred metres depending on how fast I'm going. Otherwise solid"
"The Samsung Health app was OK until the latest (04/23) update to the company's privacy policy. Now the app is literally useles until the user allows permissions to make and receive phone calls. A step too far, Samsung! Samsung already has more permissions and personal info than it really needs. Why now does it need full access to the user's calls?! Why lock people out of the app entirely?! I'll find a replacement app now. Soon I'll replace my Samsumg phone and watch. Shame on you, Samsung!"
"Hi Keith. Let us roll back a version or two. The new requirement to have a Samsung account just to use the app is pure bollocks. Here's a simple concept: integrate it with our Google accounts - all of us users have one to access Play Store. Not all of us have, and sure don't _want to have a Samsung account. Lastly. Kindly don't tell me to call the phone number you list for everyone. Not everyone who uses this app is North American based. Have a lovely day üôÇ"
"Samsung has created a useful app. It gives me information I can use on a daily basis and show my doctor. I enjoy participating in the challenges each month and reading the articles. Despite missing the little colorful walking icons, i still enjoy using the app."
"Was a great app until you wanted access to my contacts, call history, and access to my files. Nope, nope, and nope. Now I wish I never bought the watch. 5/20, I am returning the watch cause I cannot find a useful app that works with it. This health app was great, until it required all this nonsense of needing access to my usage. I don't care wha you're replay was, I'm done with this terrible decision and getting an apple watch. Wish I can give you no stars."
"This application was very good, every time they make an update, they damage it, before you could share the route map, now a green screen appears. There is an old saying that goes, ""KEEP THINGS SIMPLE"""
"I just purchased a samsung watch a couple days ago. I am unable to get the Samsung Health app to login. I enter in my email and password, the page goes to a rotating circle. It will not go past the loading page. I have uninstalled and reinstalled, restarted and I have also cleared the cookies/cache. Is there a way to roll back to an older version?"
"App does not work on the galaxy note 20 ultra. However flawless on my old Samsung 8 plus. You can't use any of the bio metrics features , heart rate oxygen steps doesn't count I work in a huge warehouse and wear cargo pants and place phone in pocket yeah app does not work work. Followed the steps and can't clear cache."
The app has been fine up until the last month where it now won't sync to my Samsung watch. I've tried unsyncing and switching everything off but still isn't working. The step count is the worst part of it.
"So sad! I woke up this morning to find that, despite my best to prevent it, my Stealth updated. I depend on Weight Management! I check it a dozen times a day...counting on it to help me lose weight. Now what do I do? Add all the meal info in in another all, if I can find one that has a comparable weight loss tool? And what did I gain in the update? My Active watch still shows the weight management program, but it is demanding an update every time I open my phone too. Will I lose it there too?"
Seriously needs to step up the quality. Needs a barcode scanner and camera scanner for easy food import. Needs far more detailed meal planning for specific diets. Calories should not be the only focus. Better widgets to improve food or exercise input. This is a basic app
Great app. How about adding live tracking of a workout on the phone when someone is using the Samsung watch to track workouts. And make it so that it plots the graph in real time and we can also play movie on the phone at the same time
"Being diabetic, I really liked the fact that Samsung Health can receive blood glucose data shared by the Dexcom G6 mobile app! And was doing so up until 5 pm a couple of days ago (Tuesday, 8/30/22). Not exactly sure what happened there! Can't get past the first screen asking for permission to share data with Dexcom. Am able to do so with Google Fit and Dexcom, but not Samsung Health and Dexcom. Wish I knew why it wasn't working correctly! Other than that, I love the app!"
"I used this app multiple times a day ,everyday. Enjoyed the global challenges. The fact that the app paused when I stopped on my walk....., but now with the new update and personal disclosures I have to make in order to access the app, I'm done . I just deleted the app ! There are so many other health apps out there that we can access without disclosing highly personal information. I will try my luck with one of those. Good bye Samsung Health App. Used to be fantastic go to ridiculous ."
"UPDATE: Hey Samsung! Refusing to open the app unless I grant permissions you don't need for a feature I don't want is NOT an ""optimal experience"" - just look at the response from your customers. I am not calling an international number to explain again that there is no legitimate reason for you to make the phone permission mandatory. I have a Fit2 which is now useless, but I'm thankful this happened before I wasted any money upgrading to the Galaxy Watch I had my eye on."
"Terrible update! Why remove the most useful feature? Weight Management was an excellent feature and was reason this app was better than the rest. It is ridiculous that such an integral part of the app be removed! What were you thinking? I fully expect the standard response below that has appeared on comments regarding this disaster of an update. What I want to hear is that the weight management feature will be reinstated as soon as possible, because if it isn't going to be I need to uninstall."
"It's incredible how much i walk during an average day, assuming the pedometer is accurate. Me and a lady at work said it wasn't accurate because i ""talked with my hands... i just got a zip tie and strapped my s2 to my ankle. The results were similar. I'm having a hard time raising my steps goal. Or maybe I'm just slow, in the head of course."
I can't understand why the heart rate/bpm/oxygen tracking was removed. I really counted on these applications as they were very important in tracking and keeping a journal. I hope that there are other options/applications available under Samsung Health in order to resolve these issues/concerns. Thank you.
"App doesn't save data. Had a galaxy fit2(which bricked when I got a new phone in November) it only recorded data through May. Got a new galaxy watch. I see the steps on the watch, but it doesn't record history on the app. Use Apple health app, it's recorded years of my step data."
"Samsung Health app was great until the last update. I can understand the MFA method but to allow access to manage phone calls and to not be able to use the App if i do not approve this, makes no sense at all. Please spear me the ""permissions to provide a better overall service experience"". BS. It's a health app. I recently change from Samsung phones to another brand, i only have an Active 2 Watch now. Guess i'll change this too until you regain your old top user experience."
"this is a great all around app for the average person. they try to eb a jack of all trades but a master of none. it varied from my Garmin connect app in many ways (sleep, workouts, etc). in short, if you want an app that gives you a good idea on how you're doing, this is for you. if you want specific stuff, id suggest something else. as for the together community, its really cool to meet new people and challenge others. however I dont like those profiles in which people are cheating challenges"
"What happened?! This used to be a great app and now it's been stripped of everything useful!! In the middle of a pandemic, you decide to take away the Pulse oximeter?!!? Really?! I can check my pulse with a different app, so I know my S20FE has the ability to do that much, but I can't even check my pulse if my watch dies! Please bring those features back!! Otherwise this app is just a waste of time and should be uninstalled. Making me consider a different brand for my next phone."
"This just started happening about a week ago, apparently with an update. The app will say I burned 5000 calories through 'light activity' completely out of nowhere. Last week it said 3000 calories had been burned through light activity at 9:30am, having done nothing but go to work. I reset everything, including my galaxy active and it worked normally for a few days and just started up with same issue again."
"The app requires permission to make and manage phone calls. If you deny this permission, the app refuses to allow you to the next stage of the setup process. I do not understand why this is needed, so maybe Samsung will be able to provide a meaningful response detailing exactly what they use this permission for. Such a shame as it turns my fitness watch into a ¬£40 paperweight without this app."
"Update 9/14: I uninstalled and install again and it works now. Changing my review to 5 stars because now that it is working I have discovered even more things you can track, like food, sleep and snoring üò¥. 9/13 review The app hasn't been working all.of a sudden. When I click to connect it doesn't."
"This app was pretty great. I enjoyed using it. Then they updated their privacy policy and now I have to grant access to make phone calls if I want to use this app. There is no reason, let me repeat, NO reason this app should need access to make calls. So, I guess I'll finally go back to Fitbit. See ya üëãüèªüñïüèº I dropped my 2 stars to 1 after the BS canned response from the makers. The ""necessary"" permissions for this app have become too invasive."
"I Like the ability to measure my heart and keep track of food, water, etc, but I am disabled so the step counter, activity measure thing, etc make me feel bad, and there is no way to let the app take this into account. For example the lowest you can set your daily step counter goal to is 1000, when 200 is more realistic for me. It would be nice if you could have your disability taken into account."
"Excellent App. But why are you asking to manage my calls in the new privacy update? Why? Why? Why? There is no reason for a health app to ask for manging my calls. Until you fix your privacy notice, I am uninstalling this app. There are tons of apps in the market, most are free or very low premium. In general, I loved Samsung products, but this is going to make me change my mind. Also, there are tons of android devices out there that can do the job."
I used to like it now I'm completely disappointed and feel this is a waste of money. Having cancer and lung issues and using this at 1 time it worked great now it doesn't work it doesn't sink and I just find this to be completely disappointing it doesn't update or notify me even though I've allowed all the stupid permissions it's asked for it doesn't sink with my phone in my watch. This has been a major disappointment and a constant downward turn since the day I got it. Samsung what did you do
"Why can't I submit sleep more than 1x per night??? Have they never heard of a person waking up and going back 2 sleep and how much it affects your sleep??? Pretty decent app, works well for the most part. Just annoyed that even with manual recording I can't split up a night sleep into 2 or 3 sleeps üò°"
"Lol, it's makes it look like I've exercised more than I have. Example, when I hike 3.5 miles, it says 4.25. It always adds more mileage. It adds up. When I do longer hikes, it can add up to 8 extra miles!"
Just got a new Samsung 4 watch for the ECG function. This function does not work. All it tells me is to download this app. But the app doesn't have ECG on it or it just doesn't connect. Wasted hundreds of dollars on the new watch. I just walked 2 miles and the app says I walked less than a mile. I bought it too track my walks. It is a failure.
"I have been using this App since past 7 yrs, from the day I bought a Samsung S series mobile device till now. Though I changed my mobile brand, but still I use this Samsung Health App. It worked perfectly fine with Samsung device as well as the good quality device I use now. Really very well designed app compared to all the apps comes with so many fitness bands and smartwatches. Waiting for Samsung to launch a smartwatch either in rectangle or square shape cause I do not like round dial shaped"
"Upgrade app and it won't let you in again. Had to uninstall and reinstall. Even then I can't get in. Useless piece of junk - get rid of it. Simple questions - when is the next release due? Will it make the additional permissions optional? You have taken a lot of flak (deservedly in my opinion) and I am sure that like successful companies the world over you will listen to your customers. Otherwise, you deserve to fail."
"I have tried several times to like this app for running. I like the vocal update during my run, but the GPS is way off. I was hoping this latest up date would fix it but I used it this past weekend and it was still off."
"I must have the option of saying ""no"" to accessing my contacts. Fix this app! Your privacy policy states that you guarantee my info is safe with you, but not with any app that uses data from your app. Therefore it isn't safe. My Samsung watch is no longer worth the price I paid. Fix this app!!!! I don't think you understand your users. Some of us may want such tight security. Many of us see no value in it. I don't care if someone sees my entries, so give me the option to refuse."
Just got the new s21 Ultra and found out that Samsung Health wont work unless you buy the watch.. Like seriously where is the logic in having an app that is present on your device that indirectly forces to buy something you dont even need to work. Having a built in health app is really good and provide you with the necessary.. Pay all that money to find out that this important app is not working for such a silly reason is Super disappointing!!!!!! It was so easy on previous S generations..
"Updated the other day and now nothing! Has been syncing for days and doesn't update?? I am seriously considering going back to fitbit, there wasn't half the delays or troubles with them. Disappointing as I really wanted this to work with my smart watch."
Removing Weight Management Huge Mistake For Samsung to think that the weight management feature was underutilized by its customer and it wasn't worth keeping clearly shows the lack of knowledge Samsung has about its user base. That was one of the only redeeming features. It's appalling to see it removed. You've lost my respect for no warning and no transparency about why it was removed after the fact. Also no note about it in the update notes or I know a lot of people that wouldn't have updated.
"It's wonderful when it works but the calorie counting feature has an extremely annoying bug where sometimes you'll try to add a food item and instead it will freeze, crash, and drop the entire meal."
"I think if a few more Indian Food Items are added to the database, that'll be much helpful, because I cook my own food, it's a bit difficult to match the nutritional contents with the already available food items in apps database. What if we can search it on Google etc and app reads the data from whatever new food items I'm trying to add ???? Please forward this suggestion to the developers. Thanks"
Great App. Lacks the opportunity to become a fully fledged app. Can you add a space to list regular medication that is taken as well as an option to record peak flow results for asthmatic customers.
"I've used this app for years. There is no more weight management/tracking on this. I kept thinking I didn't know where to find this feature, but after finally looking into it, seems Samsung decided to cut it out. Ridiculous."
Works fine except for one issue. For some reason on the last update it stopped automatically recording the blood pressure readings in the app. I cannot be bothered entering them manually.
The app really struggles to sync with the watch... Constantly disconnects and needs manual connecting. Also the fact that the burnt calories is an estimated figure and doesn't use heart rate seems really lazy from the developers...
"The app does not allow to track the menstrual cycle. Having to state the relevance of menstruation when tracking female health should not be necessary in this century and for a high end company like Samsung. Nevertheless, they still do not have an option for the menstrual cycle even though it has been requested many times. This type of behaviour helps to support the taboo and stigma that still surrounds menstruation. I would like to see the reasons that Samsung gives for not developing this."
I have been using the app for little over a year. This update removes virtually all the features I liked. But what is really amazing is the thoughtful canned samsung responses at the end of each complaint. Instead of platitudes how bout you give us a roll back link that will help us Uninstal the last awful update and use the one we want. Please note most every complaint over the last month or more has been about the last update.
"This can track how much caffeine I drink, blood glucose a dozen different ways, but I cannot tell it I am pregnant? All of the recs are completely wrong for a pregnant lady. No period tracking? What the hell? Does Samsung know women exist? I found literally hundreds of requests for both of the features going back years. This is a pretty sexist app.gonna drop it at the end of the week."
With the update i now have to allow samsung health to use my phone and contacts? No! I see how you replied to others. But i don't care what you are using my contacts for. I don't trust you. So good bye app THAT I HAVE BEEN USING FOR YEARS. Your assurances mean nothing unless you allow me to refuse the permission and still use the app. There are many other apps to choose from. You really need to rethink your business strategy.
"App ads? Why? Bought the Active 2 watch in December 2019 because I read that the watch would soon have blood pressure reading and ECG capacity. Just needed those items and heart rate. Was looking forward to using the apps for it. Well, no functionality was implemented to meet my needs. The watch will only connect to a few apps via the Samsung Health app. No direct. I'm giving up on the Active 2. Don't tell me to call support. These are not issues they can resolve. Devs can't help either."
"Prior to the 6.11 update on 5 August 2020, Samsung Health provided the functionality and user experience of a premium fitness app at no cost. It not only provided data tracking, but tools like ""Weight Management"" to provide you with actionable insights into your wellness. Version 6.11 removed this tool, and several others. This update seriously degrades the usefulness and user experience of the app. It no longer stands out against services like Google Fit or Fitbit."
"Cannot get proper steps info. Last app good outcome, steps counted, distance shown, time shown. Very good check for steps. No annoying voice etc. Cannot use the current app. Very frustrating as need info like last app."
"Loved it until the recent update. Now requires access to phone calls, camera, etc? Absolutely not. I want to track my steps, my sleep, my workouts. You do not need all the personal data on my phone and life to give me that. Respect privacy above your dollar. I'm out. Still using the watch but highly disappointed at how many features I just lost because I refuse to play your games."
"Pretty good app but I wish you could add exercises. The app doesn't recognize any of my daily exercise, like mowing, chopping wood, or digging in the garden. The number of calories burnt are readily available if you look on the web but the app wont let you manually put them in."
"Can no longer log in to the app. Met with an endless swirling circle no matter what I do. I've followed the advice given to others: clearing the cache, reinstalling and restarting. Not made any difference."
It feels scammy that the only way to access the heart rate sensor on my phone is to use this app. I don't use any of the other functions because the meal tracking isn't very good and Google fit syncs better with my watch (which doesn't have a heart rate sensor).I've disabled the app on my Galaxy S. Would love it if there was an app for JUST using the heart rate sensor
"guys, i'm updating the app in Russia, the update process takes me around the circle on the moment when it asks to confirm the phone. I get the code, send it and then the system asks for the code again. This is some kind if bug. I want to get back my data and step count in the app. Please, do something! I did what you suggested below! Nothing changed.. How can I return to the previous version of the app? Please, this is important for me. I've got my health info there!"
"For the past couple of months I have been unable to sign in. It asks me to agree to the terms and then when I do it kicks me back to the login screen. I verified my account on a PC , cleared data and cache and even uninstalled and reinstalled."
"Latest versions add advertisements to top 20% of screen. AVOID! Also weight slider is nearly impossible to use as it keeps moving past the selected value in an attempt to be ""cute"" rather than functional."
"DO NOT INSTALL THIS APP!! I used to use this app and was hoping to use it again to track my protein intake every week. Unfortunately it wants access to make calls from my phone. That's never going to happen. If the developers remove this ""feature"" I may consider changing my review. EDIT: Their response doesn't clear up the app requesting access to MAKE calls. I should be able to deny this stupid feature. Stop responding with your copy/paste response and do your job. Fix this app."
"Very disappointed. Doesn't count steps properly, very glitchy & unreliable. It asks for permission to manage calls & to turn microphone on. Why? Invasive & unnecessary. Looking elsewhere for something that actually works."
I became very accustomed to the prior Samsung health app and used it every day. I really liked it a lot and it was easy to use. Since Samsung updated the app I hate it. They stuffed it so full of ads that to me it is completely worthless now and I don't use it anymore. What a shame that Samsung would check such a useful app and rohan it with 10 million ads.
"I love it, the only thing I think they should change is how you put in how much water you drink. I think it should be in ounces because alot of people including myself use water bottles throughout the day. It would be easier and more accurate if we were able to use onces."
Thanks for the quick response and fix. Working fine again. Z. __________________________________ ver since the update where you added the woman's menstruation cycle tracker my oxygen level and stress meter do not work. It asked me to put my finger on the sensor but when I do I just get a flat line for 2 seconds and then it shuts itself off and goes back to the home screen. Please advise.
"Steps don't update in together or in a challenge unless you keep logging in. In a challenge, the ""lost by"" amount for steps states the steps for the day prior and not the correct steps. Additionally, my mother shouldn't be able to ""shake"" her phone to get 200,000 steps in 3 days. Couldn't you create a pop-up that says, ""Wow! You are running faster than a cheetah!"" and time that woman out!? For running, I wish it would keep track of my ""best records"" Besides that, I love the features this app has!"
"This app was one of my top 5 apps. This week's update removed the weight management feature that tracked calories burned based on activity vs calories consumed. It's probably the most critical part of the app. I very much hope Samsung puts it back immediately. Because I loved this app and the weight management feature has helped me lose 50lb in the past 18 months. If it's not back very soon though I'm gonna have to switch to another app . 5 star before, 1 star now. ‚òπÔ∏è Bring back weight mgmt pls!"
"Love this app. I do have one issue, though. I work in a state prison and can not wear a fitness tracker that connects to a phone. I know I can manually add most things, the thing I need to manually add though is steps. There is no option for that. I have a Galaxy watch that I wear outside of work, so have no problem with data then. Just at work. If the ability to manual input steps was available, then I would get a full picture of my ohysical activity."
I started using this app to help manage my weight during this pandemic. The update has made the app go from 5 stars to 1 star. It was a great way to keep track of my calorie intake and see exactly how active I am. The weight management tool within this app helped me a lot by telling me how many calories I should be consuming and burning and. Now I have nothing to help me. HORRIBLE UPDATE
"Hello! The app was great until it asked me to agree to the updated privacy policy which I tried to do however every time I do it comes up with the 0√ó2A#64 error. I have tried reinstalling the app, clearing cache and data and nothing has worked. I'm not from the US and I would like to get help on this ASAP because I'm really trying to track my lifestyle."
IT WAS FIVE STARS UNTIL THE UPDATE!! I love the simplified version of the older Samsung health.. the recent update is awkward it took away simplicity of moving things around on the main page.. I don't know why they did this. Come on Samsung. Don't give me a ridiculous response telling me to call you tell us why you did this!! Nobody likes the new update!!! I'm a computer engineering always support Samsung and recommend their products!!! But I tell it like it is.. this update stinks..
"I used to like this app, used it nearly every day to track my steps, weight, etc. Got a Samsung watch too and automatically monitored sleep and heart rate. Cool! Then a stupid upgrade a couple of days ago forced me to connect a Samsung account in order to use the app at all. No way will I put my medical data into a cloud account of uncertain security or privacy invasion motives. Bad enough the data were on the phone. I'll likely ditch the watch soon, maybe all Samsung products."
"This has become useless (on my Samsung phone, no less) as it doesn't seem to count steps anymore or sync properly. Time to uninstall and move on. Sad to say that Samsung can't make this product work on their own phone."
"I like most of the features and appreciate the functionality of the app. I'd like to see a pain widget added, to make it easier for those of us with chronic pain issues to track how our pain levels affect our other numbers. Even just the 1-10 pain scale would be nice (though it wouldn't hurt for users to see the actual number meanings like from a post-op information sheet in a help file e.g ""this level means you can work around the pain, but it takes concentration""). Thank you!"
"This app was great, but the updates are obviously designed by people who dont actually use it. With every update functionality is lost. Fortunately i still have an old version app, on an s7 with the heart rate & spo2 sensor. Never Update/ Upgrade!!"
"S Health is preinstalled on Samsung phones and I am annoyed with My Fitness Pal, so I have started using S Health. it's fine, I like all the different items I can record and track. I only wish that there was a barcode scanner for adding food. I am tempted to go back to My Fitness Pal just for that feature. Developers, can you make this happen?"
"This app is horrible. If you want to feel like you are a failure, this is the app for you. I finally had enough this morning when after logging my morning workout, an hour that burned almost 300 calories, and had not eaten anything yet, and it told me I was 415 calories over my allowance for the day! So, I guess it expects me to starve, even though it says that I am allowed 1005 calories a day. I downloaded a different app, entered the same info, and I'm 862 cal under after breakfast"
"You're a filthy app. First you'd decided to snatch away my Weight Management and now Exercises. What're you upto? I don't get that. I did like this app 'cause it did keep my daily running record. But after it's update. It's totally ruined. It took me 30 minutes to complete 6000 steps and it takes me 50 minutes to complete same steps. Moreover, I can't track Weight Management. What have you done with it? It tells Good or Average. I can't see that. Bring back Weight Management now!"
"The best fitness app out there. Great looking UI. Easy to use. Track everything fitness, steps, food, fitness programs, sleep, etc. Take the time to integrate in your daily routine and it becomes second nature."
The recent August upgrade has screwed up the sleep tracking and it cannot be trusted. This is my primary reason for the app and sleep tracking has be getting worse with each app upgrade. Now it is completely inaccurate.
"I really only use this as a pedometer. Haven't checked it in a week ot so. Tried to get into it today, now it wanted me to log in. I've never had to do that to see my steps. Maybe I did a couple years ago, but it never logged me out. Today, after I couldn't log in, it tried to make a new account. That didn't work. Then I tried going back to the log in area, now it's just saying there's an unexpected error and won't do anything at all about it. Updated the app, error. I just want to see my steps."
"GPS is wildly off with my Edge S7, picks up activity at odd times and doesn't sync well with Strava. Not sure if this a watch, S3 Frontier, or phone issue but Google Fit worked so much better. Once I get a new watch, I'll ditch S Health for good."
"I have used this app for several years, I can no longer use it because I won't give it permission to control my phone calls. Why in the world does a health app need to control my phone calls? Giving a 1 star, it was required to leave a review. Looks like it's time to find a new health app..üòÅ Edit- Dear Samsung, just because you're saying it's not being used, doesn't mean I believe it. I will not be using your app as long as it requires permission to control my phone calls! Sorry, not sorry!"
"My heart rate sensor has stopped working. Based off of the other recent reviews it seems as if Samsung has decided to no longer utilize the heart beat sensor built into my phone. Samsung is really becoming like Apple because they're starting to become more and more greedy with every new model. First we lose the aux port, then the sd card slot, and now we can't use our built in heart rate sensor, forcing us to either buy a smart watch or simply never use the feature again. What a shame."
"The charts are very broad. The heart rate, sleep, and exercise charts are small, do not enlarge, and have the minimum amount of data. It would be better if the heart rest chart had more detail I stead of just showing your max and min HR. Garmin has a much better app and watch. I am very disappointed in the active 2. I wish that I would have retired it when I had the chance! Even apples watch, fitness app is superior to Samsung."
"A recent update has removed the oxygen saturation test and combined with the stress test. You can take the test, save the saturation results only you cannot see them again. I am wheelchair bound and it calculated I done over 1, 500 steps in a few hours. Plus, rubbing it in, you cannot remove the steps part either. There is no reason for me to use this app now"
"Poor! I have tryed 2 different galaxy watches with this app and my samsung galaxy s10 and the heart rate measuring thing keeps saying measuring when i havent put my finger on the sensor an gives off a wave as if its reading,then when i put my finger on the sessor it says make sure your finger is on the sensor....duh....it is ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. The samsung galaxy watch classic 4 is ok at best,its inaccurate like fitbits where it doesnt accurately measure steps its really not great neither is the app!"
"No longer works. Will not show location map anymore. Yes, all permissions are on. Even when selected says not in use. Yes, data and location are on. Yes, I restarted the phone. No stupid IT answers please and just fix the app."
"I've been happily using this app for 2 yrs now and now with the new update its asking for permissions to access my contacts. Why in the world would I allow this? How in the world do you think it's ok for you to say ""we want you to have an optimal experience and we'll not use your contacts without asking you but please give us access to all of them. Completely unacceptable and a security breach. Either you fix this or in this digital age of well versed population I see your app drowning."
"Very disappointed that the new features announced today are not available to those of us who do not have Samsung Android phones. I would not have bought this watch if I knew that you were going to be so exclusive. Update: got off the phone and was told that there are no plans to enable ecg, etc for those of us with non-Samsung phones. Never buying a Samsung device again."
"Can't get onto the app unless I give it permission to my contacts and to make phone calls!!!! I am not doing this! I don't see why this app needs these permissions. So now I cant use the Samsung app üò´ I will be looking to use another health app!! UPDATE - Sorry, I'm not ringing you for this. You shouldn't be asking for permission to make calls and have access to my contacts. It's not relevant to the app!!"
Edit: to your response. You cannot get past the phone number verification. The app is not working. You guys should test things before changing it. Now your reviews are horrible. I'll find another app. What is up with the new update? I can't even get past the 2 step verification. We changes things to make them better not worse. Please fix this!!
"Weight management tracker needs to come back, ASAP! Why would you remove such a useful tool? If you bring it back, I'll change my review to 5 stars. I loved, loved, loved this app before today, when you removed the weight management tool. Please bring it back! üò¢üò´ When will the weight management tracking come back? Do you have an ETA? Are the developers working on it, or not? I'd really like to know. Thanks."
**NOT A FAKE RATING** I enjoy this app! ‚òÜ‚òÜ I look forward to logging my info in each day. The programs are versatile and help me align myself with workouts that fit my skill level. I'm a 37 year old mom who works full time and has 3 kids. I berely have enough time in the day to workout. Stress and anxiety are always under the surface and exercise is one of my defenses. My kids need a healthy momma :)This app is incredibly useful! Thank you ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ
"What have you done to this once great app ? Since the last update I find it totally unmanageable. I selected exercise bike, entered a target of 15 mins but when I reached that target there was no way to stop it. Also I'm finding it very hard to find the 'selection of activities page'. Please take it back to what is was, as I don't want it to become an exercise in itself to navigate and use this app."
"Have been using samsung health for many years. Few days ago, an update was requested, kind of mandatory and which I did. As usual, app requests approval for terms and conditions: I accepted. Then after, it requested access to my contacts and I should allow it to manage and make calls. Why a health app wants to access my contacts and manage and make calls? Based on your reply, I will decide whether to keep or delete the app and opt for another."
"To be honest I quite like the app and find it useful to monitor my fitness. However the global challenges are ridiculous and need to be policed more closely. The current leader of the 'Stronger Together' challenge which started yesterday (23rd July) has apparently done over 320,000 steps. I don't understand why people feel the need to cheat over step count but it does make a mockery of the event."
Every time I go to finish my workout (by pressing the pause button) it completely freezes the app on my watch. The only way to get it to stop my workout is by turning off my watch completely and turning it back on which is ridiculous
I find the app is a little inaccurate when automatically picking up that I'm running. I have photos that I attach of my nightly run times with distances on the photos to keep better track of my mileage.
"I loved this app, but I just updated today and the total amount of carb, fat and protein per day is not available anymore. It gives the percentage, but not how much grams of each as before. Can you put it back please? It is very important to analyse my intake of protein on my diet per day. Also there is only 4 meals now. Before there was 6 meals per day, what helped to track the amount of protein per different meal had during the day."
"New update is designed for toddlers with a very Fischer Price look and feel. Why, oh why did you remove the option to view historical data in weeks and months? Not all of us are obsessed with tracking our weight every day. No, I will not call your automated helpline and spend hours on hold when my above issues are so obvious. So please sack your marketing team and roll back to the previous version that worked perfectly."
"Good and and features. But I dont like the weak signals. Its super annoying ""workout paused. Workout resume "" if I'm in a bad signal location this voice breakes into my music over and over."
"Loved this app for all the health tracking the, exercising and, mindfulness to help you calm down! Just updated it and now I have to log in my Samsung account. I have a Samsung account. I logged in, and its telling me to enter a verification code. On the top it said ""To make sure its really we'll send you a code by text message"" I tried reading my text messages and I didn't see the code. It won't even give me a notification! HELP!"
"Out of nowhere the app demands that I give them all of my contacts. It will no longer work without that. Samsung has intentionally broken their own smartwatch unless you give them your contacts. This is an outrage and I will never buy another of their products. Edit: The below is useless. The app will not let you sign in without giving them compete phone control, presumably so they can spam your contacts. If you don't give them your contacts, you can no longer use this app, or their watch."
"I used to love this app. I lost over 50 pounds using it. I updated my phone today and now the main part of the app I was using is gone. There is no reason for me to use the app now. They took the part off that told you your calorie intake to calories burn eax over, good, or under. Why use an app to loose weight if they take that part off? Please bring it back so I can continue to loose weight and monitor what I'm doing."
Update: I don't see WHY this app would need to have permission to make or receive calls. What does that have to do with counting my steps?? how would that Possibly have any effect on how the app works or what it does. It's bloody rediculous. I'm pissed that I have to give telephone call permission to use this app. I don't trust that At All. I'm going to find another one that Doesn't require that.
"I was using the app and it was pretty good, but now it requires access to my messages in order for me to use it at all. Messaging is at best an extra for this app, so there is no good reason for it to require that access. Edit: The reply I received from Samsung totally misses the point. Why should I have to give this app access to my messages when I'm not going to use it to message people? It is possible to require those permissions to be able to use specific features, and allow users who don't want to provide those permissions to still use the rest of the app."
"Last update actually made my Samsung galaxy active 2 watch stop tracking my sleep. It was working swimmingly before the update, unfortunately it doesn't now. I even tried numerous things like a factory reset, and updating all the apps tied to the watch and still nothing fixed it. Very bummed!"
"While in Moscow, Russia, especially during its first (six-months Covid-19) lockdown in 2020, the app helped to keep me not just healthy, but able to monitor my heart performance, workouts and the calories burnt out. It's a reliable app that - once synced to your phone - it never disconnects from the phone. In other words, it does not disappointüëå"
"Unfortunately, it doesn't take heart rate into account. No matter what I do, I never burn more than 1,300-1,400 calories in a day according to the app, even when taking 20k steps in a day. Other than that, I like it. But since I find this issue to be demotivating, I am switching to another smartwatch/app now."
"In the past I have been able to use the heart rate, stress and oxygen sensor. Now it no longer functions. I even tried deleting the app and installing it back but no luck. Please reinstate those features."
"If I could give it zero stars I would have. I can't measure my heart rate, my stress level, and oxygen saturation since I got this new phone and customer service has been a joke at best in trying to resolve this issue. Not everyone can afford the over priced watch they want you to buy. There is no place in this application that states measure. The old application on my old phone was great. The one on this new phone sucks! The only constant in all the reviews is the line of BS from Samsung."
"I too have been unable to update this app because it requires me to allow phone calls which are not required to use this app. Your answer to everyone else with this complaint has been it ""makes a better experience."" The experience was perfectly fine before this update. You are just using this to gather information to sell to third-parties. No thank you."
"The app updated today and throws an error saying my phone is rooted, which it isnt. it's worked fine for 2 years until now. pops up every 15 seconds interrupting whatever I'm doing. uninstalling until they can fix it."
"I like this app and I know people that have used it for so long. It's much better with the galaxy watch active 2. But there are some issues. On the calm app in the app, I cant sign in with my account. I would also like to play calm mindfulness on the watch with my earbuds so I use my phone less. Like the breathe watch face should be connected to the daily calm lectures on calm and not breathing techniques."
"Been using it since 2016, enjoy the app and love seeing the progress tracked for so long. Lately it's been running when my phone is in airplane mode and just eats up my battery. Hope they fix that."
"At one time worked well, but now the walking step counter has just gone completely wrong. The same walk every day can vary between 4,500 and 11,500 steps (I know in reality it's just under 8,000). Some days records zero steps. I know it's free but as they use this app to sell on your health data (read the small print) you should get some stability in return."
"I purchased my Samsung Note 9 plus for this app and phone pulse sensor near the camera shutter for measurements. Not sure if all phones do measurements. If so, this app is excellent for measuring heart rate, oxygen and stress levels. Counts steps andjogging. Allows for input to monitor water intake, food, and other lifestyle changes. I'm a Personal Trainer and this helped clients in adjusting their habits, to improve their health, and activities of daily living (ADL) when they use the app.üëç"
Not sure if the steps counting is accurate but it is counting. Means I don't have to buy a Fitbit or pedometer. The only problem is that it doesn't count my steps when I walk in place at home. I do this when the weather isn't great and I want to get my steps in my little apartment. Any tips on how to get SH to count my steps while walking in place? I'm using SH on a Galaxy 9 phone. I also like to bike and I wish there was a way to record time/distance on the bike without manual input. I guess getting the phone to automatically recognize cycling is a little advanced?
"Worstly coded health app ever. I tracked my cycling activity 5 days ago on this stupid app. After that I forgot to turn it off because it never showed any running notification or alerts. The phone was constantly getting hot and running off battery abnormally. When I checked the power history of the phone, i found out it was this app draining the battery. When I opened it, the cycling from 5 days back is still on it in a paused state. How can someone design an app like this? This is joke"
"This was a good app. Now too many permissions are required to use the app. Why do you need access to phone calls? These permissions are not necessary it is plain and simple data harvesting! I can't recommend this app to anyone! Stay away! Update See the reply from the developers. Just a spin job. There is reason to ""optimize"" the with these requirements. You are accessing the information. The only reason you need it is data harvesting. I have assisted teams that developed android apps."
"I have used this app for years and found it to be of great use. I used it on a daily basis, enjoying all its features. However I will not give the permissions it requested on the last update! Reluctantly I have deleted the app. In this time of data protection, etc. this is both not needed and, for me, a step too far. There is no need to seek these new permissions! I see others think likewise...surprised?"
"Read the small print on permissions guys!!!! They brazenly accept providing your data to third parties in foreign countries... they even say they can't guarantee the safety of your data!!! If I could remove this scam app from my phone completely, I would! I'm glad I read it has all the hallmarks of a scam company with no option to opt out. I now won't be buying a Samsung device when my update is available in September. I note Samsung have nothing to say to others concerned. Not impressed."
"I have given io it 4 stars because I can not chat with my friends on board. So I request the development team to implement that, that feature will be of help to us especially making new friends from different sources or countries. But the app is excellent in performance"
"It was all good till recently, the app asked me to allow permission to access my contacts and call logs. I'm not using the app for socializing. So sorry, not gonna permit this. If certain feature require it, I'm ok to not use those. And as a developer you can block those instead of making it a requirement for installation. Good luck."
"The app came with my phone and I liked what I saw so have been using it for several years to track my walk daily and my cycling. It was easy to use and very good at what it did. I have no interest in posting my activities online or joining online communities so did not sign up for a Samsung account. Now, an account is mandatory to access the app. No, thanks. I'll be uninstalling and looking for another app that gives me the option of keeping my activities to myself."
"So I use Samsung Health alot and I genuinely think it's a good app. The step tracker works well (I'm using a S10), the food tracker has helped me lose 6kg, which I can tell thanks to it syncing with my smart scales. The heart rate also works well. My only criticism is the lack of widgets, please just allow me to use the ""section"" within Samsung Health as widgets, currently I can only see my step which is fine but at a glance it would be great to see my calories for the day and add."
"This app has never correctly synced with my galaxy watch 4. I have wasted 2 days trying all the ""fixes "" found online and none of them work. This app is completely useless amd the opposite of user friendly. Makes it difficult to track my health info. I usually love samsung products but this app is awful!"
"Watch is fine. Software locks some features for no apparent reason in my location (Qatar). This was not advertised when I paid for the watch, all the nice features that you cannot use were advertised though."
The updated version sucks!!! Loved it until I updated my phone. Totally useless now. It basically records steps and did you eat and sleep now. Cannot even tell it what you ate anymore. I removed it. You asked for am update. Here it is. I have a Samsung phone. It has bio sensors on it. They worked the first day after I got the phone. Then I updated the app and now it that is gone. Everything great made it a real health app is gone.
"Used to love it but now they want permissions for my contacts and phone. No dice. I also don't need any PR nonsense response about it being needed to provide a better experience. If I feel a permission is warranted, I'll allow it. I'm not interested in sharing my activity with anyone so why is it needed? This is just blatant data harvesting. Uninstalled."
"I have had this app and had no problem with it for a few years now, but in the last few days it has decided to wipe all my data and the step count no longer works. Not sure how to go about fixing it as the troubleshooting guides didn't help üòî it's a shame because it's great when it works."
"I have liked the app thus far however, I don't understand why when i added a food on there (which is one that it claims that I'm low on) it didn't recalculate my potassium levels. There is no indication that I've added it. It's really annoying as I am really trying to improve my potassium levels and its done this to me before so I decided to write a review in hopes that something would be done about it."
"I did up the star to a 2 because you did respond so quickly. However you didn't answer the question. Also I have been using the app for some time now and only now it wants me to give it permission to see my phone calls. Just trying to give this a chance.... so better question why can't I NOT agree to this and can you better explain how my phone calls list ""optimizes"" this app? Thank you again for responding."
"Abnormal battery drain!! This app is always the #1 battery drainer for my phone, and I never open it. I only have it to sync my steps from my Samsung frontier, the battery usage is outrageous. If there was some other way to sync my steps, I would uninstall this is a heartbeat."
I like the app enough except the step count is off a bit and the heart rate and blood oxygen functions no longer work after an update. I know I'm not the only one with this problem. Please fix it as some people rely on the app to manage health problems.
I had this app on my last phone without any issues so I downloaded it to my new phone. It will no longer let me log in to the app. It just shows the spinning wheel. I will gladly change this rating if someone can help me solve this issue!
I just bought samsung S20 FE and the step count feature is not working at all. I tried clearing data and clearing cache of the samsung health app but still it is not working. So disappointed. This is a basic feature that everybody expects in any decent smart phone.
Weight management removed from recent update. This change renders the app useless (5 stars to 1). Why bother spending all the time entering food and exercise when you have no way to achieve balance between them? It used to be easy to see where I stood for the day with nutrtion. Now I would have to drill into several parts of the app and then evaluate an equation to get my status. Ridiculous meddling by people who don't know what they're doing.
"I used to love this app, the ""UI"" updates are NOT user friendly. Agree with the previous food comments. Also I don't like how in the activity your % is lost & you can no longer tell what different activities made up your time, makes it harder to track your goals at a glance. Finally, the worst and most demoralizing is that under the weight section so you can no longer change the view to weeks or months which means you can no longer see your progress and stay motivated. HORRIBLE!"
"I'd provide a higher rating if the fitness tracking worked properly (as that is the bulk of what I use the app for). If I tell the app I'm doing a boxing workout it tells me that I burn twice as many calories than if I tell it I'm doing a workout on the rowing machine. This is while both are the SAME exact workout (same intensity, duration, time of day, etc.) With a heart rate monitor to help track calories. Clearly this is a MAJOR issue if folks are trying to lose or maintain a healthy weight."
Was better before the last update. Now it's not tracking all of my steps like before. I've walked the same route as I so often do but for two days now it has tracked around 1000 fewer steps than usual. Please fix this! Update: it still counts less steps than before. Not everyday but it's annoying when it happens. Today I took a longer route to work and my other app counted 5.309 steps and this app only 3.923. FIX THIS!!
"I've been using this app for 4 years now, unfortunately since the last update it doesn't count my steps anymore , even though I'm not pausing the step counting process and I don't use another app . I am so disappointed because this particular app was my favourite and I really liked it , and now it's not working well. please fix this issue as soon as possible. thank you . thank you I tried that and it worked ... thank you for the fast reply!"
"I LOVE THIS APP. Ever since I started this application I feel so much healthier not only that BUT I've lost a lot of weight. My Goal is 12,000 steps a day and I put in effort to reach my daily steps to be in the active Category and lose weight and not be lazy. Now I feel so sad when I don't walk or see my steps so low. I really love this app. Especially the challenges."
"Loved this app and used for tracking all my personal data for discussion with my doctor. But I don't want it used for statistics and I absolutely refuse to allow permissions request... you have no need for it if I'm not using Together, right? So let me access my data. Request the development team figure out something to get past that infinite loop where Deny sends me back around to Agree. Really sorry that NO STARS isn't a possibility."
Updated app now requires Samsung account for no good reason. I just want to use my phone's sensors. Nb: Your response is unhelpful. Not having our using a samsung account is a deliberate choice. I do not want to log in. I do not want more accounts to manage. I don't want to be exposed to the inevitable failure of your IT security and the leakage of my data.
"It says it's updating but it never does, it's stuck. Whenever I try to cancel update or uninstall, it CRASHES PLAY STORE. I tried clearing cache, restarting, everything didn't work. Not only that, I CAN'T DOWNLOAD OR UPDATE ANY OTHER APPS WHILE THIS PROBLEM PERSISTS. How is that even possible?"
"This app WAS great. You could use it to get your pulse as well as your oxygen saturation percentage. Now, you can do any of that. What good is having this app? It's useless now. Having the Note 20 Ultra, you would have to download a totally different app in order to do any of this. It's a good thing I'm in the medical field and just my pulse/ox that I use in work. Again, totally useless app. You guys could do a whole lot better if you really wanted to."
"Love the app. I use it mostly to keep track of my steps and sleep. Still not very confident with the food and drink parts as I mostly forget to add my food or cant find and equivalent. Also think the caffeine section could use some differentiation; tea, coffee and fizzy drinks have different amounts of caffeine in them. So just saying one cup is not helpful."
Love the app just wish it had a few more features like caffeine tracking in the calorie counting section would be great. The support team is very good. I look forward to seeing future improvements.
"Ever since the most recent update the app crashes constantly withing seconds of opening. I have sent multiple reports, uninstalled, reinstalled (multiple times daily) restarted phone, turned phone off and on again. Nothing has fixed it."
Solid app that does its job well. It can really work wonders for you once you sync your Gear/Galaxy Watch. Overall enjoyable gamified physical fitness challenges. Few flaws include slow performance and sometimes buggy UI.
"I'm glad the Samsung Health app is working again with my S10's sensors. Samsung took so long to fix it that I've moved on to Amazon's Halo tracker & app, which has a better UI, more features & works consistently, unlike Samsung Health. So, now, this is my backup health app. But it's just as well. These days, Samsung Health is only a shadow of its former greatness, sadly. IDK why Samsung doesn't give their app more & better attention and/or pay more mind to serious user feedback. They just don't."
I recently started using the app again and am totally baffled by the updates. It seems very incomplete. The previous Weight Management section at least explained how the daily caloric intake target is computed. Now I am left trying to recall the app prior to updates to figure it out 12/4/20 Please at least add info explaining how the daily caloric intake target is calculated. Makes no sense without it. It is necessary info for success. 1/19. What on earth? This is worthless now. No grams???
"Upgraded my watch from Samsung Gear S2 to Samsung Watch 4 Classic and my steps do not sync. The steps tile shows the last sync from my Gear S2 and even tho the Watch 4 syncs everything else, steps are not shown. If I go to select show all steps, it seems the steps are synced as the number shown is either the same as the number shown on the Watch, or it is higher than the number shown if I select show mobile steps. Below, in the ""Daily Activity"" tile, however, steps are synced... Fix please??"
Hi guys Can you answer this? Please help me My phone is galaxy s6 Since I last time updated Im not getting sleep notifications when I wake up but the app is recording hours automatically but Im getting some other notifications from this app related to walking and workout. In order to record my hours I need to open the app everytime and this is annoying me. But I used to get notifications 2-3 months ago and it was interesting
"The most recent update caused the app to get stuck when signing in, and I was forced to downgrade to make it work again. According to forums on the internet, this is a relatively common problem which has been around for a while, and remains unfixed. I prefer Google Fit, but I have to use Samsung Health because of my Galaxy Fit 2. What is interesting about this app is that it has a nutrition tracking section. An OK app, but I recommend Google Fit."
A perfectly good app now ruined (and all my data lost) through the sheer incompetence of Samsung in their choice of forcing the implementation of a highly intrusive and faulty update. Question...why try to fix an app that in the first place was never broken?. I see the ratings for this app have plunged from a high of 4.8 a few weeks ago to currently 3.8 and I for one hope it continues to plunge to a low whereas no one new will even bother installing the app. If so...SERVES YOU RIGHT SAMSUNG.
"""Samsung health monitor is not available in your location"" is the message that I get when I try to monitor BP and ECG. Then why are you selling it in my location? Initially, the phone was connecting to the watch for incoming calls and I could speak with the caller through the watch. Now that feature is not working. I don't know why. Other features are working fine."
I do like this app but don't use it to log my food. I like to prepare my breakfast and lunch for work the night before. I can only track on the current day. This has lead me to link this app with MyFitnessPal. It's annoying switching between apps and I wish Samsung health would add next day food tracking.
"Why can't one customize the workouts available on the Fit pro 2? The selections available are limited and not what I use. I must select ""Other"" for Aerobics. I have been asking for this feature for over a year now, each time I get a reply that they will give it to a developer. At this stage I consider getting a different brand with this feature."
"I have used this app for years. Now it's trying to force me to grant access to my phone calls and contacts. If you guys can't create an optimal app experience, as suggested in your replies to others below, without enforcing this ridiculous privacy breach, then you'll find users abandoning the app and a bunch of one star reviews. REPLY TO SAMSUNG: I don't use the 'Together' feature nor any sharing functions. I should have the option to refuse. Privacy is more important, I'm switching to iPhone."
Seems really hollow. The stress feature doesn't have a measure button for me even though I have a connected galaxy active2 watch. I get all excited about my fitness progress and click in looking to stay inspired and it's just meh.
"This app use to be amazing. Itwo months ago I would have given it 5 stars. Now only 2 stars. BUT now is useless. It doesn't read all my steps nor my cycle rides. I work as an HCA and on my feet for 13hr shifts. The step counter reading was between 13,000 to 18,000 steps per shift. The reading now is less than half. Which I know is wrong. It isnt picking up my one mile cycle to work and back either. This has been going on for about ten days to a fortnight now."
"I agree with the others. There's no way I am giving the app access to my phone, files, etc. That's way overstepping the boundaries of what should be a simple app. Samsung's answer doesn't explain why they think they need private information. I'm not giving out friends' info just to track my steps. I can count!!!"
"July 2020. SAD. The SPO2 reader is no longer included and stress level monitor is gone... Had to uninstall. Previously I wrote...The spO2 reader is found in the stress level tab. I take back all the sad things I previously said. This is a great app! This app works fine, looks fine. Easy to use, nonintrusive. It's everything anybody could ever want. This app should be the only app in the whole Play Store. Download it. Learn how to use it. Enjoy it and then give it another 5 * rating. Thank you!"
"They seem to have deleted my rating, so reposting. Their computer generated response is garbage. The new privacy policy is that you aren't allowed to have any privacy. I've been using this app for years, but they updated the privacy policy and now if I don't give them access to my contacts and phone, I can't track my own health. It's a hard no from me. Don't just give them all your information. Don't believe they can keep it safe."
I am so so disappointed that they have removed very important parts of this app. Heart rate/ pulse and oxygen intake and stress levels. I NEED to monitor these for my health issues and now i can not. Was great to be able to bring up these for the doctor to see. Your developers shouldn't fix what isn't broken. So disappointed i can't even rate it!.
"The update eliminates all the relevant information on quality of sleep. All it tells you now is what time you went to sleep & when you woke up....who needs that? I already know when I went to bed! What happened to the percentage of sleep efficiency, percentage of light sleep, deep sleep & Rem Sleep? I guess I need to use my FitBit and no longer need Samsung products."
"I entered my metrics into the program and it said I was obese... I could do 2 things, close the program and never open it again or change the metrics, I decided to change the metrics and using Samsung Health I've lost 20lbs in the last 3 weeks! I use it alongside my Galaxy watch. Proof is on the scale! Oh, I also got a bmi scale that pairs with the app, it really helps..."
"Have used this app for a few years and have enjoyed it (mainly for the step tracker and seeing activity trends). However the most recent update changed its permissions, in order to use the app it needs access to make and manage your phone calls, something I don't agree with. You're even locked out of your activity history if you don't accept (i had 3 years worth which is now lost) Super disappointing. If privacy issues like that concern you then you should not use this app"
5/25/2022-next Fiasco I did a update and it's still not complete started 3 days ago. I can't view my steps since then either...What's next??? SOLUTION- after viewing several useless recommendations UNINSTALL & REINSTALL worked perfectly & all of my data is back 4/17/2021-Was great until this mandatory two step verification and more digging in my privacy. How disappointing....
Every time I try to log on for the first time as a new user and hopefully new patient for your mental health services the app shuts down. It is also asking for and supplying a text verification code every time I login. Is that normal after the first verification request is complied to. If so I would rate this lower than I have if it was possible.
"The app has been fine. I use it with my galaxy watch which I love. But I'm dissapointed to see that there are literally no intermittent fasting apps that integrate with Samsung health. Everything integrates with fitbit/google fit, apple etc."
Clutzy but Comprehensive. Overall an extremely detailed app with many useful insights and helpful coaching. The interface and display could be more intuitive & user friendly but the depth of data is good if you have the time and patience to analyse it
"I depend on this app to count my steps. Lately it no longer counts all my steps. It's frustrating to be actively walking & watch the step counter sit still. I also use Noom, which lately is much more accurate. For example, on 5/27, I walked 10,490 steps according to Noom, but Samsung Health only said 7,606. Dramatic difference. When I watch the Noom counter, I always see the step count increasing. Samsung Health has better analysis tools and syncs with other apps, so I need an accurate count."
"Great app, for the most part.... Have used this now for about 6 months and love the fitness tracking functionality of this app. also, the community aspect has bee a great motivator and encouragement, until now... I've just notice the ""comunity"" forum is not available on my app. I am walking the monthly challenge, and now where I once had a link to enter the community and view fellow Health walkers posts and add my own bits of encouragement, all I have is a list of ""rankings."" Temp problem I hope."
"I will NOT be giving you permission to access/use phone and contacts. That I can't use the app at all now because I won't allow this is RIDICULOUS. I choose which features to utilize and do not use the ""together"" feature but you penalize me for that choice. You've lost another user. *** how many people have my # in their contacts and have shared it with you? It's NOT there's to give or yours to take. Data mining and privacy violations run deep."
Needs to allow other platforms (specifically Bellabeat) ability to upload activity. Having to have my phone on me all of the time to use the internal step counter is not practical or realistic. This app is a waste of my time if I can't upload my stats from my fitness tracker. Maybe the opportunity to manually modify the internal step counter amounts???
"This app is almost complete. It needs two very, very important things. 1. We need to be able to change our macro goals. We don't ALL have the same macro requirements or goals. 2. We need to be able to scan food barcodes. In order to beat the other apps and use only Samsung gadgets, Samsun needs to roll out an update we these two changes."
"Not possible to enter custom intervals. As I have my own training program and the programs in the app don't match my schedule, this app is unusable for me. Looking for a replacement for my Garmin watch, the Samsung Galaxy watch won't be it due to lacking functionality in this supporting app."
"One of the most useless apps of all time. The ONLY time I ever saw this app working was when it was eating up my data or CPU usage updating something. Just yesterday, I walked more than a mile. I go on this app just now to see how much calories I burned, the thing was stuck on a blank white loading screen every time. What are you updating?! What are you loading?! What do you do?! ETA: No thank you Samsung. I don't need more frustrating things in my life. I'm using another app to track steps."
The app shouldn't need access too your contacts. It's an app not a place to make sales or business deals from your contacts. Also it shouldn't need access to your phone calls. Technology is getting too noisy. I've used this app before and I've never had to give you permission to my contacts or my phone before I can use it now I can't even use it you guys need to stop trying to be so nosy if it worked before it can work now
The phone number requirement is stupid. I don't need anyone to find me on this app or add anyone and I certainly don't need this app having permission to make calls from my phone. I just want to track my steps and food/water and really don't see why these permissions are suddenly necessary. There are plenty of apps so I guess I'll stop using this one even though it was convenient and already on my phone.
"I love this app but the new permissions needed to use it have seriously ruined it. Why does a health tracking app need to be able to access my contacts and make phone calls?? All the responses from Samsung on here have been cut and paste answers that still don't actually explain why. I have used this app for years, sadly it may be time to switch to a different one."
**Updated to say selling my phone and watch.** The have officially removed all useful aspects from both. This app is just a glorified step counter. HATE IT. Do not use this app. The new update ruined it. I bought a gear fit watch to go with this app. I LOVED the weight management feature as it kept me on track for my weight loss goals. Why on earth would you remove the most useful tool in the app? *lame reply Samsung.
"I left a one star review for this app and uninstalled it. Then I received a notification that the developer had responded to my review. And my review is gone! Shenanigans! Here's what I said: it is unacceptable for this app to require access to my calls and contacts. At the most, that should be an optional permission. Those permissions are *not* required for the core functions of the app. Samsung, you are losing my trust rapidly."
Sleep tracking has big problem that Fitbit does not have. If I go to sleep at 9pm and get up for 1 minute at 11pm it attributes that first two hours of sleep to the previous night's total (What the heck?) and says I started sleeping for the current night at 11pm. Fitbit is smart enough not to do this. This bug causes the sleep totals to be ridiculously inaccurate. Fix this!
"I am enjoying this app. However, it is very irritating that I can't log my sleep in separate times, like I actually sleep. So my app will say I slept from 1am to 7am when I really slept from 1am to 3 am, then from 4 to 7. Also, if I take a nap at some point through the day I can't log it either. Aside from this, the app is great."
"I have enjoyed using this app for years, but now it requires permission to access everything on my phone, which is totally unnecessary. I do not want to do group 'Together' activities. I have now lost access to my data. Please provide a version of the app for people who want to use the app for their own fitness and not to do virtual group activities and challenges."
"This is a cool app. Track your daily calorie intake, daily step count, sleep patterns. Graphs out all this info automatically. If you have a smart watch it can track your pulse and blood pressure."
"It now requires mandatory login and phone number after the recent update. It worked fine before the update without requiring any personal details. Update: I understand the login part, but it is also asking for my mobile number to login? Else it would not allow me to use the app. In these difficult times, the Oxygen level check was really handy, however I think Samsung is taking advantage of the situation and using this opportunity to profile all users and market it to the Healthcare industry ??"
"This app came preinstalled on my phone. I used it daily to track heart rate and blood oxygen. Worked great without access to my private information and contacts. The new ""Update"" now demands total access to your private info. Reguardless of what the developer claims this info is for marketing and tracking purposes and not needed to ""Enhance"" the program. I promptly deleted the app and advise everyone else to do the same."
I have been using the app for several years and found it terrific. I have a Samsung Smart Phone and a Galaxy watch. The reason for the one star rating is that I can no longer get into the app unless I give Samsung approval to use and send messages through my phone. Why? I have tried to log onto the website but get an answer but only receive an error 404 message. Has anyone else had the same experience?
"I'm not the only one with a negative feeling about the ""phone permissions"" being required to use the app. I can see where Samsung has an automated response to this, claiming that this access is only to be used to ""improve the service experience"", but what good is service if you're forcing someone to accept the terms to use the app? An opt-in agreement would make sense, where the app would still be usable without that feature. Please consider this for the next update"
"I used to really like this app, but a few weeks ago it stopped letting me know when I hit my 10k step goal. I no longer get a pop up notification that I have hit my target, and it bothers me. I uninstalled and reinstalled and it still doesn't give me a notification for hitting my step goal, but it will tell me that I've got my daily activity. Also it used to give me my weekly progress on Sundays, and now does it on a random day"
"I have enjoyed using this app to monitor my activities for a long time. Now it wants access to my contacts and to be able to make and receive phone calls before i can access my own data?!? No, Samsung. Just no. I'll give it a day or two for this to change and then its bye bye Samsung. UPDATE - DOWNLOAD GOOGLE FIT and then use the HEALTH SYNC app to transfer your data from samsung health to Google Fit. My next phone will NOT be a Samsung."
"Love the app. Have been using it for three weeks now but unfortunately my water tracker is not working properly anymore. I forgot to add in yesterday's intake and when I tried to add it in, it wouldn't do it correctly. And today is the same - it's very erratic at the moment. Would love to get that sorted! Thank you :-D"
"I really liked this app but they are removing features in ""updates"" without notice. the O2 sensor was really helpful and it suddenly disappeared. I know it's ""free"", but it is still rather disappointing."
"I'm really liking this app, but as a massage therapist, I wish there was a way to account for/track the calories burned while giving a massage, especially when I'm doing deep tissue work. I know I'm burning more calories than just being at rest, but nothing registers it. Also, the fit watch I have to put in a pocket or attach to a bra strap while I'm working. I really wish there was an upper-arm or ankle band or clip for it."
"Used to be accurate, but recently noticed the app doesn't count all activities (walking etc), yesterday my daughter and I, almost walking side by side (different phones and apps) had a crazy difference of about 5k (hers were more than mine). Initially thought it may be due to a due update. No update due, so I'm going to uninstall it again"
Still has the issue of unable to log in there is just a circle spinning!! Just bought a galaxy fit and I cannot properly test it without this app. Just gonna return as Samsung is not fixing this issue for months now!!! I would give 0 stars if that would be an option... The number you gave here is out of service! Do you have a Danish contact number?
I noticed that I would be way more thirstier than usual. Some nights I would get heart flutters and palpitations while I was laying down. I started using this app and tracking my meals. With this app I realized that I was consuming 3-4 times my recommended sodium intake. It explained my thirst and heart palpitations. It's been 3 months since I made a diet change. I feel like this app saved me from future health problems.
"The whole two step verification is just stupid it has put me out of my Samsung account for the past two years. It keeps wanting me to sign into my account, when I do it tries to send a code to a phone number that I haven't used in years! I've gone in circles trying to change # but I don't give a damn no more I've had like 3 different phone numbers since. I don't even care to use Samsung account anyway. I've gotten bye w/o it the past two (2) years. So just delete this app yall..for real! ZERO ‚òÜ"
"Never really used this before but now that I'm taking fitness seriously this app has been an invaluable companion. Seriously underrated. Love that it has tracking for women's cycles, I don't even need an additional app now. Now if only there's a section to track intermittent fasting, this app would be just FIRST CLASS."
"I walk A LOT for my jobs and use to never have issues with it tracking my steps, but the last few times I've tried to check my step count, it does nothing. I guess it's not tracking anything or keeping track and idk why. ** ETA UPDATE: It wouldn't let me. I had to uninstall abs then reinstall before it would work again."
"CONS: Just not user friendly. You can't edit your macronutrient goals, you have to search for a food every time you want to enter it instead of there being a list of foods you have already added to food diary. It has a bad representation of how many macros you have eaten and doesn't show you how many calories, protein, carbs, fat you have remaining for the day. PROS: I love that it connects to my galaxy watch and I can see my steps, goals, and intake from anywhere on my watch."
"Good app that works well with wearables. Just wish the water tracker inside the app allowed one to customize the fluid ounces of water consumed. It'll be much easier to log water intake since I drink out of a 32oz tumbler with ice cubes throughout the day. Can't find a way to change the set ""glass"" of 8.4 fluid ounces."
"Can't be postmenopausal. Should be able to delete Track My Cycle. Ageist app. Also if I set my normal sleep time and wake up in the middle of the night, then after a while I fall back asleep, it shouldn't show as a nap. A nap should be outside of my normal sleep hours. It looks odd to show something like 5 hours and 12 minutes of sleep time total including ""naps"" during normal sleep time."
"If you're looking to lose or maintain weight then this is the app for you. It's like having your own personal fitness instructor, dietician, nutritionist, and doctor in your pocket. Calculates your calories intake and all nutrients and tells you when your diet isn't balanced. There's lots of stuff on this app that will make you fit, healthy, and happy. Veey recommended. Great job Samsung üëç"
ADS? Seriously scamsung?! I bought a phone that costs $1400 and you will put an ad on this app?! What's worse it that it takes almost a quarter portion of the screen and it cannot be turn off despite opting out from the marketing information. Don't be a greedy scamsung! We don't deserve this kind of nonsense and you guys don't deserve any star at all.
"Why do my active minutes show I have burned anywhere from 5000 - 6000+ calories in addition to my regular day activity? This has only done this the last couple of days and is showing that I am 2500+ calories under my goal. This is all well and good, but not accurate when today I had only 84 active minutes and burned 6732 calories from that. Any solutions to this??? I would rate this more stars if this could get fixed. Or maybe operator error??? Got help, and works great. Love the potential!!!"
"Use this app regularly for my sleep analysis and body composition using my galaxy 4 watch. Suddenly the main body composition screen is blank, so I can't delete measurements and see a detailed breakdown. Cache clearing did nothing and I don't want to uninstall as I'm not sure if my data will be deleted."
"I used to really like this app that was already on my phone and it was very helpful until they updated it and now it's requesting me to sign into my Samsung account which, I've never done. Now this good app doesn't work and I'm not going to ever try to figure out how to sign into my Samsung account. That was a huge fail update. Thanks for nothing."
So I just got a galaxy watch. I had a fitbit before so never used the Samsung health app. I tried to download and use it but it keeps telling access denied. With a error code as long as the day is long. I have called Samsung and they said that I have to remove the latest update and reapply it. But the nearest place that will be able to this is an hour away. I would really like to use it. I did call the number and they said thay I would have to go get the latest update removed.
"Have used this app forever. Now with latest update it won't allow me to use it without access to my phone data and/or contacts. Sorry, but there's no earthly reason for a health app to require this info (unless to creep on the user). Too invasive by Samsung! I would never consider using Samsung Health Together. Wouldn't it be better to request permission to use the feature rather than the whole app? Not much point having a heart-rate sensor on my Samsung phone if Samsung don't allow me to use it"
"I can't find any customer support for this app, but it seems Samsung replies to reviews for support?!?! Weird. Well, if you're reading samsung, here we go! I used this app somewhat regularly to track my steps and activities for given days. Used it for years, works just fine. However, tried to log in today to check my steps for a long hike I did yesterday, and now Samsung Health is forcing me to use 2 step authentication just to use this app. That's a little much, In my opinion, there's really not much sensitive data in here. That said, I tried to set it up because I REALLY wanted to see and track my latest data, but the process for setting up two step authentication is riddled with errors and a cumbersome process. I provided Samsung my phone number (I didn't wan to, but you MADE me in order to continue using this app. Grrr). Then the verification code page would NOT allow me to hit the verify button after plugging in the verification code sent to me. Had to do have a second code sent, then the Verify button worked. Then the app asked me to log in AGAIN (I was already logged in from the sign-in page?) with my password. Tried that and then it threw some exception error jargon and kicked me out altogether. Then I gave up. It had been 20 minutes dealing with this. I just wanna know how many steps I walked yesterday, and 20 minutes later after giving up my phone number to this corporation for ""security"" I'm still no closer. This should have taken 20 seconds to get results and not 20 minutes and no results. Fix the errors or even better, allow two part authentication to be OPTIONAL. I understand it's far better security, but i don't need that level of security for just this app, which, prior to me being forced to provide my number, didn't have any sensitive information I cared to secure."
How do I add my insurance carrier to the Experts Online Doctor Visits if it isn't listed? I gave 2 stars for the effort but I did not schedule the visit because I did not want to overpay being that I have insurance. It should be a live chat so that someone can help with this issue. And why are all the features that are useful being removed or disabled? The app should have just been updated with original and new features added...not any taken away. The oxygen monitor came in handy..why touch it!
"Love the app - 2 problems I have though: 1., there are tons of cheaters on it, I call bs on a few dozen ppl getting 200k+ steps a day in. Not a huge deal just kinda annoying. And 2., what the heck are the dialogues from the little characters on the challenges?? They're literally insane. The seal says ""I'm endangered, won't you care for me?"" ""Seeing you healthy makes me happy"" that is so weird!!! Just say normal stuff like ""you can do it"", ""we're all rooting for you!"" How is that hard to write? Stop being so weird Samsung! I will volunteer to write better dialogue for your app for free. Seriously."
"This app replaced Map My Fitness and My Fitness Pal because it did everything in one. My real only complaint is that they should broaden the types of exercises, and also maybe tweak how many calories are burned when running. At first it was fairly accurate, but lately it has been way too generous. I emailed tech but got the standard reply that calories burned is just an estimate and depends on weight, height, bmi etc. I get it, but it went from 400 cal for 5k run to 600 cal."
When I had this app on my Samsung S-7 it would record stress level and pulse using the phone camera. Now that I have it installed on my Motorola I can't. I like it because it will still record my steps and I can add my BP. Those are the only 2 reasons I didn't rate it 1 ‚≠ê star. If there is a way to record my stress level and pulse using my phone and not a watch of some sort then I'll rate it 5 ‚≠ê ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê stars. After posting my review I went through a lot of other reviews. WOW not good S.H.
"Useful but doesn't track sugar intake. Now that I've been diagnosed with diabetes, it would be helpful to track my sugar intake. I know the data is in there, because that's part of what I enter when I add a new food to the list. Please allow me to track sugar, not just carbs, in the foods part of the app."
"Really curious, why are there are ads in the app? I paid $1000 for my phone, $300 for my watch and $700 for my tablet. And now I get ads. Unacceptable. Maybe Apple is the way to go after all. Response to response. All along the top of the app are ads for credit cards and various other things. Denying that they're there doesn't mean they're not there."
Total lacking of custom nutrient info. Can't add supplements and can't add any addition nutrient like vit b b12 turmeric. You should allow us to add a these things. Since I am forced fed this app which is ok but I refuse to gave 90 apps that do partial things. Since you made it for Pete sake make it great. I need to track food and nutrition. I do not want multiple apps to do it.
"Useless. Samsung, in their quest to absolutely ruin everything for those that want root access on the device they paid a lot of money for, has decided to block Health for root users. Sure, I can get why Pay is blocked, but health? It's a fitness app, not a bank account. Not a single other fitness app is blocked from root users, but Samsung has to be extra special always. So, yeah, this app does not function."
"I absolutely hate your new update. Bring back the Spo2 sensor and I'll put a 5 star. And no I do not have the stress measurement feature.. Apparently Canadians aren't considered good enough to have this. So yes, we don't have a spo2. I just wasted money buying the s10+ and remove one of the selling features. Let's see which company I go to next year."
"Auto detect workout option is nonsense. Doesn't detect most of the movement. After recent updates, it's become absolute rubbish. Also, no way to get details of sleep and quality of sleep."
"I had used this app daily since May 2017 until earlier this year. No, I will not give you access to my phone so I'm now looking for another health tracker. Really sucks because I really liked this one. ‚òπ EDIT: And it's the same B.S. automated response. Obviously, many of us DON'T CARE for a ""together feature"". We want to be alone & in peace. If the complaints are from a fraction of the disappointed users then MANY are dumping this app. Smart companies learn from mistakes & fix their problems."
"I was more or less happy with this app (although the sleep tracking has been wildly inaccurate with my galaxy watch, but I have narcolepsy which could mess that up.) But the latest update where it won't let me use the app unless I give it permission to ""make and manage phone calls"" pushes me right over the edge. I am unhappy that I have bought into the samsung family of products if this is how they are going to treat my privacy."
"I loved this app for many of my exercise activities, walking, swimming, elliptical & biking. Then the update & was asked to agree to policy in settings, I allowed then asked again etc. Excuse me but how many different ways do I agree? so I uninstalled and am trying to find a new app that counts all of my activities in one location. Samsung really screwed me up in so many ways!"
"I enjoy this app. BUT I really hate that when you are logging your meals all of the amounts don't change. The calories will change based on how much you say you've eaten but the fat, carbs, sodium, sugar, etc. Do not change at all. Everyday it says I am at the max limit for sodium intake. I never add salt to anything and if I have the option of buying something with no salt or lite salt I do. Other apps adjust all nutritional amounts accordingly so why doesn't this one?"
"Great app until I realised it wanted permission to my contacts & phone calls. Such a bummer to as it was a great app which I've used for years and years. But first and foremost my privacy trumps any app. So long Samsung Health, I have uninstalled and won't be returning until I know my privacy is respected. Edit - even though you've mentioned it's ""not intended to make phone calls"", having to accept the Ts & Cs we're still giving permission. I will not be risking that ""unintentional"" phone call."
I liked this app until I opened it on my new Galaxy S20 phone. I liked the fact that you can measure your stress levels and oxygenation levels and heart rate. Now on my new phone the only thing this app does for me is record my steps and shows me the distance I walked. Even though the stress level option is available there's nothing there that says measure when I click on the stress part of it. There is no way to measure stress level or oxygenation or heart rate. Why?
"Until the recent update, I enjoyed this app. The app now requires access to your devices phone/contact list before you can use it. I find this unacceptable and and stopped using the app. Therefore I plan to delete the app soon unless they make this an option rather than a requirement. The programmers of this app seem to know what the customer wants more than the customer as they respond similarly to all complaints regarding privacy. Suggestion... listen to the customers."
"I love my watch and I love the data from Samsung Health. HR, steps, period tracker, excerise, etc. I recently lost all syncing and tried contacting customer service. No response. I left a 1 star review and the response here had steps I was unable to follow. I kept trying and figured it out on my own. So 3 stars for my current customer service experience, which is actually 1/5, and actual app use is 5/5."
"Great app. I have just one recommendation, for the step counter/tracker, would it be possible to update the app to be able to set daily step goals according to days of the week instead of a general daily goal? (Ex: Monday goal of 15,000 steps, Tuesday goal of 8,500 steps, etc.) I think it would better benefit a lot of people. Please let me know. Thank you."
"Still waiting for us to be able to connect with family and friends by email, I sent this suggestion in 2018, we in 2021 and it's still impossible. Every other app connects by Facebook, Google or Email requests. I will still be using the app, just not as much"
"Why is the app suddenly asking for access to my calls? I'm in the middle of a 10 week training program and suddenly I can't access it, unless I grant the app access to my phone. Why would it need that!? Edit: In answer to the developer's nonsensical copy-paste response to my feedback: Clearly, looking at the avalanche of one star ratings, many users don't think they're getting ""an optimal experience"" at all."
"As others have mentioned, this app used to be great. I enjoyed the calorie counter my steps, goals, meditation, there was so much. But now they want me to agree on giving up my privacy. Couldn't do anything anymore without accepting that. And I DO NOT ACCEPT. Gave some lame excuse about making the app better and whatnot. Such a pity- it was already great but my privacy is none of your business. Time to find an alternative."
"I was looking forward to and update, but it seems to have a lot of useless information and difficult to get to my activities. Also, I bike 4-5 times a week and was disappointed today when instead of my average pace, it just told me my current speed. Don't need that as I have a speedometer. I need a pace to judge how I am doing on my ride. Please bring that back or at least let us have choices of what we want to hear."
Got the Classic Watch 4.0 but now the tracking is odd it doesn't tell say you reached x miles at a heart rate of x and speed x now it just constantly vibrates very annoying. Going back to my old watch and giving this one away. As the progress updates when biking are actually nice to have.
"Nope! You will NEVER have my permission to make & receive calls! Why'd you have to ruin a perfectly good app? I've used Samsung Health since I found it pre-installed on my first Galaxy phone many years ago. It used to be easy to use. I liked seeing my steps data & sometimes checking my pulse, stress, etc. NOW I have to find another pedometer app to use!"
I can't get access to the app because now Samsung Health wants me to give them access to my CONTACTS AND PHONE CALLS. I only use this app to measure my heartbeat and check how long I was asleep. There's no way to skip the permission. Well then I guess you and your app can go to hell. I didn't pay for the phone to not have access to the default apps.
I like the sleep tracker. It doesn't count steps very well on the watch It'll tell me I need to get up and walk and I haven't sat down in the last hour. Thats the watch though. It counts them fine on my phone. But my biggest question is WHY DOESN'T THE OXYGEN MONITOR WORK?????? I see it on the app. But why doesn't it read?
I want the weight management on this that is on the Galaxy 8 app I had. Now since I have upgraded my phone I am no longer able to check stress levels or oxygen levels either. There has been no activity since July 21 when I changed over to AT&T
This app used to be great with tracking how many miles I walked. But now it's inaccurate. I walked 4 miles and it only says I walked .5! I hope this gets fixed soon because I liked using the workout feature but now I have to rely on Google maps to know how many miles I've walked.
"I enjoyed using this app to complete the walking challenges each month. Today I opened it and now it wants access to my contacts, I declined because I do not feel this app needs my contact info. Now I cannot use this feature at all, very disappointed, I will be uninstalling this app as soon as I'm done writing this review."
"Very disappointed in Samsung. You pay top $ for a new Samsung phone but that's obviously not enough for Samsung, now they require you to buy a watch. I just unstalled the app. Thanks, I just got Covid and the doctor wants me to measure 02. Told the Dr, no problem, I was wrong, there is a problem, the feature was removed. Big tech forcing you to spend more money because $1200 just wasn't enough for the greedy corporation."
"watch did an update yesterday. it's started talking to me again even though I have blocked notifications and force stop the app on my phone. it canceled my ""workout"" walk after 3km. it's also now losing steps as i walked 7.5km but only got 7000 steps when I usually get about 9000 for that distance. not good samsung"
"Mostly good. Unfortunately although my Active 2 watch can track my SpO2 , there is no chart for this in the app. This is a big miss. If the sensors are there, why not use them? The ""stress"" chart is not a good enough substitute. I read that there used to be a SpO2 trend but they removed it for some unknown reason. Not a good idea. Could be a real help for people with sleep apnea if they would just enable it."
"With Android 13, battery draining, can not disable sensors only, it will not sync with Watch 4 anymore when sensors are disabled. I have to delete app to get control back of battery drain. This limits usage of my Watch4, please fix this battery drain issues."
"This app used to be great and I have used it for a few years. Now, the app does not partner with competitors. The app no longer syncs with fitbit or Garmin. I used to have a Gear S3, but I bought a Garmin Forerunner because it is more accurate. The Samsung Health App won't accept data from Garmin. I am most likely going to get rid of my family's 3 Samsung phones and cut my loyalty from the company now. I have been loyal to Samsung for years, but I hate it when companies hurt their customers"
"They update the app to force you to give them access to your phone and contacts! Why do you need access to my phone? Makes no sense! I understand giving you access to my location but the phone and contacts? Sorry, I don't think so! So I deleted this app as a result, it's a shame because I used it to track my workouts and steps. I will be looking for another app to do the job without asking for unnecessary access to my phone! Goodbye Samsung health it was nice knowing you!"
"I don't want to log in. I don't want a Samsung account. Stop forcing me to make one in order to use products. This might very well be the last Samsung phone and product I'll ever buy. Fix the app, remove the forced login, and I might consider giving you another chance Edit to the response: Maybe give the users the option to manually back up their information. Again I don't want to log in and have a Samsung account. If it's a requirement going forward count me out as a Samsung user."
"There is no way to view any of this data online, Samsung is aware of this. Instead of addressing it they mark all questions about it as solved and ignore their customers requests. Furthermore, this is less a complaint about the app and more the ecosystem as a whole. My watch unpaired from my phone/this app without warning and refused to re-pair. Samsung refused to do anything about it unless I paid them $70. I do NOT recommend this app or any Samsung fitness products. Period."
After the latest software update on 25.08.2022 is draining the battery. After uninstalling the app the battery drain has stopped. I have tried reinstalling the app start draining the battery straight away. üôÅ After the suggestion you made the battery drain has subsided to an acceptable level. Thank you for the help. I will change the star rating to 4 stars as the app has been great before the update.
"The last android update force updated this app. Now, before being able to use it, i must accept the terms and conditions, so, i touch the link, and voila, the terms and conditions are presented in a language i cannot read!!! To keep going, there is no way to change this language. Consequently i didnt accept, and so this app is now useless to me!!! Last android update and this app is only consuming my battery faster than i can charge it. Its one of the very few apps i can remove, so its gone."
It's not syncing with my Galaxy3 Watch
"It's OK. Tracks sleep pretty accurately. I suppose it's good for most of the common workouts. Needs more customizable options. I use a scooter (not an electric one, just a regular step scooter) to commute 2.5 miles to work and 2.5 miles back. There are so many workout options but scooting is not one of them. Can it be added?  Also, I would like to be able to customize the amout of water and amout of caffeine. My paper cup is not 8.4oz and my cold brew coffee has more than 80mg of caffeine."
"I'm in agreement with everyone here giving a 1 star. Samsung, clearly your customers have spoken. We are NOT in favor of the updates you did. I think it's time to make another ""update"" and change the app to how it was. If you don't want to lose more customers your company should remove these changes. There is no point in telling me to call the phone number you have been providing to everyone else. I have already uninstalled this app. I will not reinstall this app until it's back to how it was."
"Application is great , only short coming is that it doesn't have any dark mode UPDATE: OMG! I finally started using it as it is meant to be and dude it is soooo good. You really don't need any other application apart of this for not only your physical health but also mental health. This app is really amazing, I strongly recommend anyone to use it. Shortcomings: Still no dark mode and UI could be better to attract more people using apps like Nike Run plus etc"
"Still really a bummer that the body composition is still way of my real body fat. I have the exact same problem for my scale at home if I dont chose my body type. Therefore people with a lot of muscle get a reading with way too much body fat with the watch 4. This can be helped by giving people the option to chose what kind of body type they have, just like my scale at home. Its really a shame. The readings on the watch are really steady and and accurate, but made for the wrong body type."
5 stars .. Add an option to keep an alarm when you snore
Used it for the longest. It always tracks my steps and heart rate. Just noticed that the heart rate monitor is no longer an option so I'm looking for another app. I'm a traditional watch guy and I have almost one hundred watches. It seems all the good stuff is disabled to force me to buy their smart watch. I'm not a smart watch kind of guy.. sorry. Just uninstalled the app today.
"Not happy about this, I understand my note 10 doesn't have a pulse sensor. But why can't I still input the info when it comes from my cheap watch or another phone? Doesn't matter how I get my record but can we please get to record it for future references? That & the stress record, its the same thing really. Please add this to the new update& I will add more ‚≠ê! Thank u"
"I very much like the app, it meets my needs. I do wish in the sleep record , you could add a section to put in information such as ate late, worked out, sick etc to help understand what may affect your sleep. Sleep Cycle (which I no longer subscribe to) has this feature and it helps a lot understanding what you do during the day affects your sleep patterns."
"This app is deceptive. It says I have cycled, swam, and walked. The trouble is I drive a semi so all I've done all day is sat in the same seat. Not sure how I'm supposed to know how far I've actually walked and such when it's tracking my trucks movement. On a good note my semi apparently is staying active and healthy. Would love to use the app to track myself though."
"Can u add another workout option. Skateboarding you have snowboarding, skiing and roller-skating. Also I cant set a goal weight and have it telling me how many calories I need and how long it will take to get to my goal. Also it won't check my heart rate or my stress level all these features were helpful and I do not understand why they have been removed."
"Everythings works fine to me. But there are one problem that annoying me for a couple days now. The problem is some foods in the food track sometimes are not in the list after I searched for the name. For example: I have a banana cake for the breakfast few days ago. Then I have the same banana cake after a few day in the afternoon but i cant find the banana cake in the search list, although i had typed the full name of that food."
"The core app is good, but I've just seen an ad in the app for ""Leaky Gut"". The link brings you to a sales page for a diet to cure some illness that was never proven to exist by any real scientific study. Wikipedia shows this ""Leaky Gut"" to be psuedo science. You are showing obviously innaccurate and misleading health information in the ads in your health app, and it calls into question the accuracy of anything else in the app, because it wasn't screened or approved by anyone who cared."
"I wish samsung would do more to stop people from hacking/boosting in the monthly challenge. Unless, I am to believe that some people are walking 65 plus miles daily, over the duration of a month while still looking obese in their profile picsüò§üò°. Update: I see that Samsung still haven't attempted to stop the boosting on the global challenge. Considering most places in the world are on lockdown, I'm amazed by how many of the top 1% have walked over 2 million steps in less than a MONTH."
I just bought an active 2 watch after a friendly highly praise the weight management tool. It was awesome because it would tell you how many calories your burn during the day and if you are under your calories level to lose weight Well. Today that features is gone... I'm highly considering returning the watch now as this was a high selling point for the watch.
"Basically decent app. I would like more linked exercise programs for seniors. There seems to be only 1. I would like to be able to more accurately enter my sleep. Older people tend to be awake, asleep, awake, asleep all night. I would like to not be nagged by the app at 4:43am about not meeting step goals when I just got out of bed! Do marathon runners, exercising before 5am, use this app?"
I have only one complaint with the app and I wish they would fix it. Why don't they have a automatic screen lock for all water related activities? If there can be a automatic screen lock for swimming then why don't they also have it for water aerobics? I do a lot of split workouts in the water and when I'm in the pool and want to change from swimming to water aerobics I sometimes waist 5 minutes trying to turn the screen lock on when doing water aerobics. I wish they would fix this issue.
"I went to Settings there isn't any Applications. The new data entry time for exercise it is not working properly. Seems everytime there's a new update, the app isn't working properly ie now it's the sleep section üôÑ"
"Always see ""Error Can't open app"". Tried to solve the issue with support team, but the also cannot help"
"I had to reduce this app to 1 star until they fix their newest issue. This app alone is draining my battery. It will not sync with my watch and no solution found online will work (outside of possibly resetting my watch or phone, which I obviously want to avoid). When will Samsung recognize that people with other brand phones (Google Pixel 6 Pro in my case) still want to use their watches and that's ok? There has to be a better way to integrate with other phones. Please fix this problem."
"It has been a while since I logged on to the app. Am I incorrect in remembering it use to have a sensor tracking ability for blood oxygen levels? I swear i remember that. If that is true, am i just missing it now? Because I no longer see it. I really liked that feature and hope if it is no longer here, that it gets restored."
"Why do we need sim to open this app? Like I can't even see my sleeping track, etc. Just wasted my money buying this expensive watch not impressed Samsung."
"I refuse to update my app. All the comments I'm seeing here are disheartening to say the least. I love my Samsung devices. And it is ridiculous to hear that features are going out the window left and right with the response of. ""Push pause, unpause...clear cache, force close...sorry you lost your info. Sorry you don't like the app now... telling the developers..."" I hope you know you all are going to lose customers by losing features and basics on the phones. Come back Samsung!!!"
"The new update sucks! Some things are ok with the update but now I can't see how many carbs, protein, fiber that I am getting. I need to see these things for my specific diet so I can stay under 100 carbs a day and make sure of how much protein I am getting. I can no longer do that. I'm going to have to stop using your app if you don't fix that. Some of us need to know exact numbers while others need to know percentages. I'll update my review when you fix the problems with the new update."
"My last review was deleted. Apparently, the oxygen sat. measurement has been moved. To be clearer, Samsung uses this app, which some people use to try to get and remain healthy, as a platform for ads. I turned off ad notifications, yet some still get through. I suppose, if an advertiser pays Samsung enough money, they will ignore your privacy settings, because money seems far more important to Samsung than an individuals health or privacy concerns. Is that clear enough, Google?"
"New previous Fitbit user. Not impressed so far. Water is in ounces not per their measure of a ""glass"". How do you record a 20 oz. bottle? As a fitness tracker Samsung makes a good watch. Watch died after attempting to use the water function. 5 months old and on its way to repair. It seems that water resistance isn't a feature that can be used more than once. This from a independent repair tech. Now wearing my 6 y/o Fitbit. $250! $50/mo of use. Not water resistant.$220 for repair!"
"To ask for a lot of access to personal phone info is not necessary or needed for a health app. Why do you need to know who my contacts are? Update to your response: I read through your new privacy agreement and it states otherwise. There is no need to have access to personal information like my phone calls, contacts and email messages when using this health app. Your automatic responses do nothing to convince me."
"Okay so I'm only a few days on Samsung. I came from Fitbit. Fix your sleep metrics. It won't allow me to add the sleep I'm not showing last night or edit my start and end time for sleep. Plus pretty sure the HR piece needs a solid update as well. And can we have an option to get rid of bloat like Bixby? Never used it on my phone, not going to start on my watch."
"Udate: Thank you for your response! Ever since I changed the band on my watch I get more consistent and accurate readings for everything. If you have a silicone band on your Samsung watch, I recommend getting a nylon one. Good. Could be better. I don't feel like it's measuring my entire night's sleep. I fall asleep early and wake up early, but the app says I fall asleep late and wake up early. What's going on the first 4 hours of my sleep?"
Over all I really like and enjoy this app. It's very user friendly and I've had little problems with it. However one Complaint I have is I am not able to view my old workouts or runs. I am only able to see the last 30 workouts. Does anybody out there know if there is a way I can see my workouts day-by-day from 2 or 3 months back? Or further then just the last 30 workouts? Also If this feature is not available on this app does anybody know in app that you're able to view your past workouts??
"Like others have said I also used to love this app until now that Samsung wants all my personal information, such as, location, my phone, camera, personal contacts, etc. There's no reason for Samung to have all that just to know how many steps I take a day. Actually I'm sure there's a reason Samsung wants all of my personal info but I'm sure it's not good. I will no longer use it."
Had to download this to fully use the watch I got as a gift. Won't let me create an account because I need to download yet another Samsung product (their browser). Good grief. I will never recommend Samsung because they require you to download and give more and more of your personal information. I'd rather get a Chinese knockoff that doesn't require four apps to use.
"Update 7-14-22. Thank you for bringing back the heartrate, pulse oximeter and stress measurement ability! I have restored rating to 5 stars. What happened! I use this app on my s10 daily and it used to work great, loved that I could measure heartrate, oxygen level and stress, but since an update a few days ago, no longer have measure buttons, can't do any of those now. What gives? If I don't get those features back, no reason to keep app."
"I would give 5 stars but I just had to uninstall the app because the app wouldn't work anymore. It kept giving me (for security reasons, Samsung health will not operate in a rooted phone) I looked up the issue and force stopped the app and it worked for about 15 seconds before giving me that error as well. I have an S8 and I'm wondering if this is a problem for newer Android software because my bf has a Motorola and has the same problem."
App going backwards. Less easy to access historical steps. No idea why it was changed. Now have to allow phone access to even open this fitness app. Bonkers! The admin response was that this was for implementing app functions and for 'optimal user experience' which doesn't even begin to explain why access to my phone is required for a fitness app. I have enjoyed this app and its 'user experience' for years without giving permission to access my phone so why now. It's just another info grab.
"Uggggggghhhhhhh, y'all just gonna make me buy a Samsung watch, huh? This app used to be great, but now won't count my steps. I just spent the past 2 hours walking but haven't seen an increase in steps since then. They were stuck at 1731, even though I'm pretty certain I've reached my 10,000-step quota for the day. This has been happening for a couple of weeks now. Very, very disappointing. You better quit playing games with my health."
Mine Galaxy Watch 4 and One Plus Nord. App not opening showing server error 0x2C1#1. But same is seamlessly opening in Samsung Mobiles. Please rectify.
"Hi can you please help me out. Since the last update, the app has not worked probably, especially about the step measure. I walked 1000 steps (counted by the base app in my phone) but SSH counted only 20% of the steps. One time I looked at my phone while walking and saw that the number didnt increase according to my actual steps. I hope you can advise me how to fix this, I do miss the monthly marathon!! Thanks. Kerk"
"I have used this app for several years. Along with my fourth Samsung smart watch. Currently Active 2. The permission the app is asking for now, just to open, are unacceptable. I have uninstalled the app. I also will be looking for a different phone, and watch in the future. You have lost a loyal Samsung customer!!!"
"I agree with other users, I really liked this app and used it all the time until recent updates mean I can't even open it without allowing access to my phone calls and contacts. I think it should be my decision whether I choose to share that info or not and find it disturbing that it's a necessary requirement to starting the app. I don't care if they are not planning to use the information, i don't see any reason a fitness app should need it! Will be downloading a new fitness app thanks."
"How disappointing this app is since I can't even open it without giving permission for a ""health"" app to use my phone and contacts. I have no desire for a 2- step verification and don't do any of those challenge things people are talking about. It's a shame we don't have a choice in the matter and has ruined a perfectly good app. And no I don't care why they feel the need to actually give people less choices and invade my privacy so there is no need for samsung to reply to my comment."
This used to be my best fitness app till today when I upgraded it. The weight management section is gone. And I thought I may have tampered with it. So I uninstalled it and reinstalled it and realized that the weight management is really gone. I just looked through the reviews and I realized I'm not the only one unhappy about it. Please can you guys bring back that part of the app? It's my favourite section because it helps me keep track of the calories I burn.
"Excellent app! Works perfectly with my Pixel 6 phone! Tracking excercise and sleep with so many data points, snoring, blood oxygen levels. Sleep score. Wow! With the Samsung Galaxy watch 5 so much to explore! Tons of watch faces, and the Google Pay app functions without a hiccup! Highly recommended! üòÅ"
"I've a high end Samsung phone. S Health is a stock app on my phone. I don't want to see Ads on a Stock app. I can understand the presence of Ads on a Non-Samsung Smartphone. What's the incentive of buying a Samsung high end phone üôÅ? Edit: 7/8/20 Thanks for getting back to me! I called the number that you shared, they said, S Health will have Ads. Even Google Play store says that this App contains Ads (placed by the Developer). Both are contradicting your statement."
"I agree with the people with recent reviews below. After the last update, I have to allow them to make and manage phone calls. What? Plus the privacy policy says nothing about why they need to make and manage phone calls. I read the responses posted by Samsung, but still do not feel comfortable with this. I'm finding another health app."
"The application doesn't start because it needs the SIM card. It turns out the sim is needed to identify the country. I'm using on a Samsung Tab8 ultra (+1400euros) and I don't have the LTE version, so cannot use it. It's a shame this requirements (easily bypassed using IP or geolocation) cannot let me use the health application on this device."
Once I got into this app I seen that it was very helpful keep track of everything the information is correct and reliable
"This was a good App. Dont waist your time people. It's just a step counter. All the good features have been removed in the latest update...Samsung remove the title ""Health""...your app developers really blew this one. Sensitivity isn't why I'm conscious about my health. Your app developers must be the new world snow flakes. You can keep this app, as it was 4-star. There was no option for zero-star! Deleting this garbage app. It was a good app until this update. See you Samsung."
"Step count horribly wrong, 4956 steps in a 1600sq/ft home while never leaving the house while playing on my computer all day... Man I'm super healthy üí™. Also what happened to sleep tracking. This app can't seem to figure out that I work at night and sleep during the day. Come on. No. Fix the app. Stop using auto reply to call you as a cop out. Make a beta version so can talk to the devs."
"You don't need access to make and manage calls on my device. Shame because I love this app. Straight uninstall. Edit - change it back and you'll gain more customers and I'll rate it 5 stars. Your justification for why you need to make and manage calls is honestly meaningless to me. I have used your app since 2017 and you didn't need that information for an ""optimal"" experience until now. My guess is you don't need it, therefore your reply is hollow and i think your lying."
"Used to really like the app for run info, but because I synced it with Mapmyrun, all of my workouts recorded from my Samsung watch got replaced by the workouts in map my run, except those have less information! All I want is for Samsung health to send data to mapmyrun not receive it but even noooooo"
Samsung! You are a large technological giant. How do you not have the ability to scan upc codes for food in your own app. Why is it that I must use a 3 party app to add food information via upc code and it transfers the information to your app. Can we please cut out the middleman. Can you just add upc barcode scanning to your app. This would put your health app on a whole new level. Inputting information would be much easier. Hope you are listening.
"There is no experience, no matter what I can't get past the start up. I get an error. ""ERROR OCCURRED. NET::ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED. I have tried uninstall/reinstall, checked name and user id, reset password, create new account...everything leads to the same error. I guess now I won't be able to access the information on my galaxy watch 4 classic from my phone. I thought technology was supposed to make life easier? Wish I could just uninstall everything Samsung and start fresh."
This app was good until the last update!!!!! Its so much worse now. alot of things are gone and harder to read and understand. And the best part is... It wont let you uninstall update. I use this everyday all day. It is very important to me!! Thank you Samsung for ruining a perfectly good app!! If it's not broke dont fix it!!!!! I would have given it 5 stars before! Not now! Only 1 because I HAD TO! Along with so many other users I am Very unhappy!
"Yet again, even though the devs are denying it, there are ads in the app. They had disappeared for a while but with the last update here they are again. Most updates in this app are just making it worse (denying access for linking other apps, removing certain functionalities,...), which is an issue. I am regreting my purchase. Also, I will not call your overseas number just for fun so giving it as a solution, as you have to others, is just aggravating. Give me an EU number to call."
It doesnt work. It doesnt even open on my phone. I uninstalled it and downloaded it again yet still not working
"UPDATE: Macro intakes measured in grams is back and easily accessible. I still have a few things I do not like in this new UI but I understand that they have received a lot of mutual feedback so I expect a revised UI soon. I will update my rating from 1 star to 3 star for now until the revised UI is released. Thank you for listening to us, Samsung. Maybe try a beta tester for UI overhauls in the future if you haven't already."
"oOxygen's sensor, it's obvious with all the negative reviews about the deletion of the OXYGEN SENSOR, and the generalized response about it being incorporated in the stress management area shows that Samsung basically doesn't care too much about it's customers. There are a lot of customers who want it replaced, probably a lot because of medical issues. I for one after going through chemo found it to be on par with the professional monitors at the hospital, so I used the heart rate and oxygen."
"I have a samsung S10. This app was useful to track steps, measure heart beat, stress, oxygen levels, then all features using the sensor stopped. So frustrated I uninstalled and reinstalled now the measure buttons are gone. Apparently you must now synchronize a wearable to get measurements. No need to use this app."
I buy a galaxy watch because it markets that it can check ECGs and blood pressure. But then when I bought only I know that certain regions can use this function thru app. Please update the app. Now a watch that cost so much can only do what a Xiaomi band do. Makes me regret and questions if that I should buy a mi band instead of Samsung when the functions is so little.
"I will be returning my Samsung watch since a large part of the reason I bought it is that I didn't need an account to use the basic health functionality, and now it's been made a requirement. The only other option is for me to delete my data. Another company with a history of data breaches forcing us into forking over personal information. Nobody wants this. Stop demanding data and accounts to use basic functionality."
"Samsung needs to fix this app ASAP. Since upgrading to Android 13 in my Pixel 6 Pro, it has caused significant drained. The operating system is saying that Samsung Health is running in the background and draining a lot of battery. When I uninstall the app, battery improved."
"I am sorry, but I have gone this route before. Calling the number is a waste my time. Firstly, I don't have 10-15 minutes to wait on hold before I can speak to someone. Also, I have called before and explained in detail what issues I had seen, and nothing has been done to fix them. In some ways they have gotten worse. Steps are sometimes missed, as well as workouts. Locations on the map are incomplete. 500 characters in a reviewe is not enough space. An email address would be better."
Generally good but why have you removed the map of route hiked ?
This app is not working at all. The only reason I got the watch was to track my workouts. It hasn't worked properly in over 2 weeks. It does the countdown for my run and then goes immidiately to my home screen and does not even start the workout..
"Wouldn't open, reinstalled, same issue. Samsung s20, with s3 watch. The app asked to if you want to accept data tracking and or personalization, and will not go past that screen, just sits loading.. redownloaded, same thing. It work on my old phone just fine"
"The app won't refresh and it is stuck. It won't update based on my Samsung watch. So it keeps showing the loading icon, but it doesn't update, and since it is ""updating"" it's contents I cannot use it."
"I refuse to grant this app permission to make or manage phone calls. Listen Samsung instead of copying the same useless reply: I don't use and don't want to use the together function. It doesn't need access to my contacts. I need to replace my Samsung watch and find another app that is not a privacy black hole. It's the end of the line Samsung: I'm removing your broken products from my life and my gear watch is next. Also, I can't be contacted using the app. Check your grammar, Samsung."
I can't check my BPM or BLOOD PRESSURE anymore. The changes are not user-friendly.
"I used to love this app. Though I use it sporadically to track most things, I was using it to track my women's health. But when I tried to log in it is requiring me to allow the app access to my phone calls?! Why?! Why does a ""health""/""social"" app need access to my phone calls? It does not make my experience better. It tells me that I need to find another app that isn't so intrusive. I don't allow my apps access to that information. UPDATE: went w/ Fitbit and I LOVE it! Can track cycle AND sleep"
"Previous review deleted, which is very uncool. The app doesn't do BP with it's own ecosystem as advertised (Galaxy watch 3). Menus in app not intuitive. Few options to correct data, like, say, when I forget to stop recording exercise time. Also don't delete reviews. If I don't respond, it's because I don't want to call you. I didn't write this so you could give me a chore. Send me an email. It's not like you don't have my address. Gotta own this one you guys. Sometimes you get one star."
I was so happy when I put a review on this portal that someone had responded to me by email immediately. The email informed me that they were sorry that my device was having issues and to contact a phone number to get a hold of someone for assistance. The phone number took me directly to someone who had helped me in getting my application to function the way it always has for me in the past again. I am so happy with this application and the related device again now. Thank you so much Samsung.
"I have used this app for years and was suddenly forced to update. The updates wanted access to my contacts, phone to make calls and to many!! Permissions. I will uninstall and look for something else. Who ever thought of this needs to be fired I dont care if you dont make calls or contact my contacts that information is none of your business. I may look into this and see if it's even legal. Dissatisfied customer!!! Developers in Korea!!! Reallyüò§üò§üò§üò§"
"Sleep tracker needs to automatically record but has no option for this as a setting the user must confirm in the app, why who knows? And so it never records anything, steps is fine wigits are good üëç the data is displayed quite usefull. Shame sleep function requires continued user input."
"This new update just gets worse and worse. There is no avg steps in the weekly summary and you've lumped all indicators together in daily activity so there is no way to track anything. It's like you dummied down the app but for who, people who don't use fitness apps? Gee, that makes so much sense! Looks like time to find a new app!"
"Before the update all was good & now since; it's not great. It used to say when you'd not met your target: ""You were active yesterday for...mins, try being active for...mins."" Now it says; ""You've missed your daily target... try to add...activity into your day"" This is a very negative tone that doesn't acknowledge the fact that the little activity may have been because of injury etc! Plus the new update drains my battery. Thinking of going back to factory settings on this app for this reason."
"I had this app on my phone & use to love it. Upon updating my phone, I had to accept the new Policy which included this app having access to all my phone calls (amongst a whole host of other features which are not necessary when all I needed was a step counter!) I Needless to say, have now uninstalled this app on my phone. If I could give it negative stars I would. This is the first review I've ever written so that should be an indication as to how much of a fail your ""uodated"" app is!!!!"
"Apart from an awesome screen, the only reason I keep coming back to Samsung is because of S health. But I have a quick question. How can a competition start for 5 hours and someone clock 100000 steps? Does the person live on a treadmill? I consider myself quite active, but that is the step I take in a week, even though I skip 20 minutes a day. I don't trust the results anymore."
"Can't login on my non-Samsung phone to Samsung Account. Wanted to connect my Galaxy Watch 4 to the Samsung Health App for stats. It shows a page saying that it doesn't work on the browser although I tried every browser possible. Including Chrome, Samsung Browser and the ones mentioned that are supported."
"I liked the previous version of the app, but this new version sucks. I do heavy weight workouts three days per week. I used to be able to measure and save, with remarks, my BP, Heart Rate, and SO2. With this new useless version I can't even use the Samsung app anymore. You really messed up a previously great app. Why didn't you just leave the app alone when it was useful?"
"This app requires access to make phone calls, in order to start. That's seriously shady for a fitness app and there is no way I'm trusting Samsung with that kind of unnecessary permissions. I didn't expect Samsung to be part of the shady group of companies who try to increase their profits by selling your personal information. Hey Samsung, how about you send me your biometric data, heart rate, exercise habits, location and phone number? I promise I won't use it for anything bad."
"Having to manually turn on/off cycling and running is pretty annoying. Although walking is auto, you need to activate it manually to capture elevation. I forgot to turn it off and now have a top walking speed of 33mph because I got on a bus."
Well I used it for many years untill now it needs access to manage my phone calls. No.. and Samsung is giving a garbage reason. Want me to rate this app more than 1 star. Clearly explain why it needs to manage my calls. What optimization or feature needs that Edited to respond to Samsung. This has never been needed before. Why the change? Explain it technically. Give me the option to opt out. Your app dose not need access to manage my calls or contacts. That is an invasion of privacy
"Why does it need to access my phone? Why do k need to set it up so there can see my data and see me challenges? Up until recently I used this app a lot. The recent changes mean I will not be using it. Terrible intrusion. Edit. No I'm not phoning, and these permissions are not needed the app was fine before. Terrible stock answer to all disgruntled reviews."
"I use this app to look at my sleeping habits, now it needs an samsung account which sucks but its not the end of the world. But I cant log in. The fix ? Start the app without logging in and then login later. This issue has been there for almost a year. But now, you cant start the app without logging in first, so its unusable. I really regret spending 300‚Ç¨ on a watch, which after a year still doesnt have all advertised features and will never get some because I use a Pixel. Just buy a Fitbit."
Hi I can't access my Samsung account as I lost my previous phone and cannot complete the two step verification process
This app requires excessive permissions for setting up 2fa with a mobile phone number which is insecure. It is unacceptable for a health app. Why are you not using industry best practices?
"I'm with everyone else, remove the last update that requires permissions to everything. You keep posting the same comment about 'it's for better user experience'. Learn how to perform actual customer support and SOLVE the issue, NOR continue it. I'll be glad to remove the app if you all don't resolve it...I'm sure there are other comparable apps that don't require access to every aspect of our phone..'for better user experience'."
"I really enjoyed this app until the most recent update. The sleep information seems to be dumbed down, now they don't give you any of that useful information about what kind of sleep you were getting. What's going on, you should be improving your features not removing them, I'm sending a theme from my experience and from other people here. Please bring back or improve!"
"Hey everyone! Finally sorted, how long it took is irrelevant, it is now sorted and I'm very happy. A simple setting change in the Privacy Settings. If you choose not to share your info with Samsung Health, it won't use your data and you won't get the info you want! Makes sense! Thank you Samsung. Happy and Healthy again!"
"Use to be a great app that I'd use. I can still keep track of my steps by whatever it says, but haven't been able to use it anymore because I won't blindly give it permission to access my contacts (why?), my microphone (nothing on it used my microphone, so why?), or phone calls (why?). No need to have those permissions and just makes the developer responsible to safeguard it, which I don't think they could or care to. Stop requiring full blind permission to access all my info"
Used to be perfect (Why remove certain features?) Weight Goal was the best part as you could enter your weight and calorie intake and it would calculate how many calories you should eat or exercise you should do to meet your weight target. This would also be altered to match how fast you would like to loose the weight over. I cant understand why this feature would be removed. Will this feature be added back and when? Then il rate five stars once its back
"I formerly used the Samsung Health app to monitor and track my O2 Sat levels. Since the recent ""upgrade"" this function is no longer stored separately. It's bundled with heart rate as part of the ""Stress"" component. I can't figure out how to track and trend my O2 Sat individually. The Samsung Health app used to be great, but now I will be looking for a new app to do this. What a shame."
"Despite not being rooted, having the ""Official"" status in my settings proving that it's not rooted, this app hasnt worked in ages. Samsung Support is abysmal trying to get hold of, so I havent even bothered to create a support ticket. *edit* I cant access the app so how am I going to get support that way? I'm in the UK, I'm not calling that number and spending a fortune to be on hold for 20 minutes"
"I've been running recently and I love my Galaxy Watch 4. I've been trying hard to not overdo it and to stay in aerobic exercise. This require a lot of stop and go for me initially, as I'm prone to a fast heart beat and it's easy to get my heart beating very fast. I feel like I'm constantly looking down at my watch to check my heartbeat. Is there an app or setting that will tell me through my headphones or vibrate when my heart rate goes above a certain target?"
"It's a good app BUT it really needs more types of measurements on most everything. Ounces, cups, tablespoons, etc. Often grams must be converted somewhere else. If it reads ""serving"" with no actual measurement to determine what a serving is, someone must search elsewhere to find what measurement equals 1 serving."
"Funny, just did a review this morning and got a message about a response and come to find my review is gone. So, lets do it again! This is literally a piece of junk app now that they don't allow you to check your heart rate, oxygen level, or stress. Something that I used everyday, multiple times. So now this is no better then the rest of the useless apps just like it."
"If you have this, never update it. I've fallen into yet another Samsung trap. Can't use Health because I can't agree to the privacy update without accepting 2fa, but I can't trust Samsung, there is no such thing as support (Apple they ain't). Now I can't really use my watch, and that makes the whole ecosystem useless. I knew better, I knew to stay away from these products and I've had nothing but difficulty. Please run away. Starve these people out of business."
"I am getting started on more movement to fight chronic pain issues. I simply start a walking workout to track me while on my treadmill. As soon as it starts, it says ""workout paused"". Then randomly pops back on & says workout resumed. Out of 19 minutes( that I tracked with the simple clock on my phone), it caught 3 minutes & 5 seconds. It's been like this for months, I just finally took the time to write it down. If I can track it myself, it has me doubting why I have your app taking up space!"
I really like this app. my only suggestion would be that it would be nice to be able to scan my food barcode to add it. I can't seem to find all the foods I want to log so I feel some days are not completely accurate. I have MyFitnessPal to log my food BC I can scan the barcodes. I'd like to just go down to one app.
"It was good before after my phones os was updated. Now it is not syncing data. It is really not tracking any movement. It was better before. Used to really like it, but now really horrible"
"S Health is a great app; it tracks so many workouts, activities, and hobbies. On top of that it has trackers for weight, body fat, caffeine intake, stress, etc.; Samsung clearly legitimately wants to help it's customers get and stay healthy. The only reason I gave it a 4 out of 5 is cause the tracker for bike rides have a three second delay before it starts tracking you; it does this everytime you move from a complete stop, and that tends to make the miles I rides a little inaccurate."
"Wth?? If I don't give phone permissions app won't open!! Not giving this permission! What do you need it for? Guess I can't use the app anymore! That really sucks because I liked it and used it all the time! UPDATE: Based on your reply, I guess you are not going to fix this! I am NOT giving these permissions! SO I guess I am done with the app. Not happy about it."
"""Active Time"" must show monthly comparison bar charts, as was before. Daily active time is not meaningful; it is neccesary to be able to compare month by month, as before. Also, the colored hearth superimposing three variables is meaningless: you cannot make any information by watching them."
"It wasn't my go to until some recent health issues and I needed more than Fitbit could give. I was very excited to learn instead of manually entering my blood pressure (because I forget), I could get a BP monitor with an app that would feed my information directly into this app. I scooted out bought the recommended monitor, downloaded the app. When I open Samsung health, and attempted to connect the recommended app, it told me ""Not available in your country"". Really? Work it out, people!"
Most of compatible accesories are not available in Malaysia market. Kindly add new accessories that easily find here
"Great watch and features, but the oxygen does not work. And when I lay awake the watch still sense that as sleep. So it is out with that a little. Blood pressure monitoring are perfect no complaints. But I really would like the blood oxygen to work as well"
"Wants a two-step verification for an app on the phone that I'm using. If I'm using the app on my phone obviously I don't need a two-step verification for the application on the same phone that I'm using the app. Also the app will not work Without activating the two step verification, which I do not want to activate. Now I need to find another one after using this app for 4 years. Data lost and literally a pointless security system. Ya lost me, going back to Fitbit, it's Far more reliable."
I just started using the app on the first of April and LOVE IT. I have lost around 40 pounds so far and do tell others about it - at work and wherever.. Just one minor issue - if I happen to need to recharge my phone at work I have no way to keep track of my steps. I bought a pedometer to keep track and it would be nice to be able to enter these steps into my step count when I don't have my phone with me. I entered the time and distance from my pedometer as walking but my steps didn't count. I can't really afford to get the Galaxy watch to go with this so any suggestions would be nice.
Fun app for tracking steps but many cheaters on the top end. Latest: 4/28/2021 I am about to delete this app The app demands access to my contacts in order to participate. That is not going to happen. The responses from Samsung are not credible. They don't need access to my contacts you enhance my user experience. I can't think of one good reason why thos is absolutely necessary to access my contacts and I can think of lots of bad ones. So goodbye Samsung. I was good while ot lasted.
"Was a fairly decent app, new privacy policy makes it too painful to use. Will be deleting it and uninstalling it. They now require two factor authentication in case someone has your password. Someone at Samsung is smoking crack. If someone has your phone, and has your password to their app, how is sending a text message to that phone going to help your privacy or security? It is just information security theatre. I am not giving them my phone # and they are not allowing me to opt out - into the bit bucket they go."
"1st, how is it that this app does not have a barcode scanner for food entry yet? It's not like that is new to fitness programs - other fitness apps have had it for years! 2nd, the reply from developers to Scott Gibson on 7/24/20 is an outright lie - the top third of the main page of the app is scrolling ads. The bottom of every activity screen is ads or links to ""related content,"" or ""ads you didn't ask for."" Stop lying and update features to compete in this market."
"Why did you guys remove the macro count for the whole day? Will no longer be using this app because of that. Why would I ever trust Samsung Health to tell me (a bikini Competitor) how much to eat in a day? I don't want percentages based on your suggestion....I want to see macro counts! THIS APP IS USELESS NOW!! EDITED TO ADD: After many complaints, Macro counts have been reinstated on the app and I can finally use it again to track macros leading into show dates! Thanks for listening to us!"
I like that this automaticly tracks my movement and I can set it up to keep track how long I swim before I get in the water. the only reason it got 4 stars is for the falling reason. I can add foods that are pre made and the assumption is that I cook it as it's on the box. what if I don't use any salt and instead of regular milk I use almond or soy milk . it would be nice to be able to make my own recipes add my ingrediantce and than use however many servings I had of my low sodium diet.
"This app was great until it required permissions to read/make phone calls. I'm not going to accept that, especially when it doesn't explain why it needs it. The canned responses users are getting is troubling, because it seems they don't want to say what those features are or don't know why it needs it. Guess I'll be picking up a Garmin watch and uninstalling this app."
I love this app. A scanner for scanning food would make it A LOT easier! Please consider adding this feature. It has been a year since i wrote this with updates in between. Still no scanner! Please add a food barcode scanner!
I used to be able to manually add workouts since I don't wear my watch when I lift weights. But that option is gone with the recent update and now the app is mostly useless for me. All it does is count steps.
"The only thing I used this app for was to measure my SpO2. The measurements proved to be very close to those from what my doctor measured, and i regularly use the app to check my levels. Moving that functionality into the ""stress"" set of tests is not useful. I'm not interested in a canned response. Please break out SpO2 measurement back to its own function on the front page of the app."
I love synching MFP and my watch up to see all my statistics . Its like playing a videogame where you can see all your achiements graphed out lol. My only problem is why the heck would you make the lowest point of the weight graph 23lbs instead of either my goal weight or maybe the very lowest i could be underweight without dying? 23 lbs is a really weird point to stop at. Now even though i lost 16 lbs it looks like i didnt lose anything and is very discouraging. Thankfully MFP graphs it better.
"Sadly disappointed in the app. I buy a flagship phone and watch. Try to begin learning to take care my health and open this Samsung Health app... What's the first thing I see? A giant advertisment across the top. This just rubs me the wrong way. I want to learn to manage my weight and stuff, not be tempted to spend more money after getting a $1000 and $250 watch."
A fitness app doesn't need access to my phone to make or record calls to track the things that it does. There is no clear explanation anywhere on why and the replies to the reviews aren't answers but to call a number to get answers. Where people will need to sit on the phone for a long time to get to someone to read a sentence or two of nothing that doesn't explain anything.
"I'm locked out of my app. When I try to open it it says ""sign in"" then when I tap the sign in button it says ""an account already exists in account manager"" leaving me no option to enter the app at all. Did you not like the review Samsung???? Please let me back into my app!! I need the data!!! Edited 1/17/2021 I spent all day Saturday on the phone with Samsung. Received absolutely no assistance whatsoever. Finding another app to utilize for diabetes statistics. üò†üò†üò†üò†üò†"
"Recently switched from Garmin Connect and a Garmin fitness tracker to the Galaxy Watch Active 2 and thus, Samsung Health on both my Note 10+ and Active 2. Not a bad app but the most disappointing thing is that it has one major weakness. Unlike EVERY OTHER fitness app on the market that connects to a heart rate monitor, it does not use heart rate to determine calorie burn. So if I select a weight workout and sit around most of the time or train heard with a heart rate of 160, the calorie burn is the same. That is beyond disappointing and a major oversight on the part of the Samsung Health team on both Android and Tizen. I've looked online and and this is a common complaint, and has been for over a year, but Samsung Health has done nothing about it. Please give us the option to include heart rate in the ""calories burned"" algorithm of Samsung Health. I love the phone, the watch and the app but this is a major shortcoming."
"Another update and the removal of weight management that everyone has been complaining is not back yet. Since you were replying so nicely to all comments, I was going to give it a go and wait for new update. But you finally have convinced me to move to Garmin. Thank you! Latest update is ridiculous. What's the point of the update if you remove useful functions and the only change is a colour scheme. If its not being reversed soon, many customers will switch and no point to keep the watch."
"can't log into my samsung account, so i can't use the app but wearing my watch without it pops the ""download samsung health"" notification endlesslyüôÉ"
"I've been using this app since forever. And I enjoy using samsung flagship device. And now you want to make more money by inserting ads in this app, telling me to buy galaxy watch active2 that I already owned. Ruining overall experience using samsung device. Making it felt like a cheap phone from another company. Please stop giving us ads in all your apps."
"I enjoy all the workout types the app offers, but"" together section"" is limited. You can only have step challenges with your Friends. Together is cool if were a mall walker. why can't we challenge active time daily, any of the tons of workouts it tracks or most calories burned or a combo of everything, steps included. How about doing workouts together? If you have lte version. The IOS app Won't allow friends to join ANY CHALLENGE WE START why? If you have app, why are the features so limited?"
"The Sleep Score is very inaccurate and fluctuates wildly even when having the same consistent elements (cycles/time/rem/deep/awake/light), etc. Until they make corrections it's not worth using your Samsung smart watch."
"Not impressed with the app, and no better than the previous one (also not good) Still so bad....works very intermittently, extremely frustrating. One that was in use a couple of years ago was way better."
"Seems to no longer support S9 and Gearfit Pro 2. Only steps works as of July 30. Looked for help on Samsung support and told my devices were told old and I was playing with fire. Really??? Also, what installs no longer looks the pic s at download."
"Loved this app and Samsung watch and now it wants to make phone calls and won't let me use the app if I don't agree? What is going on? ETA: I seriously can't believe I have totally been locked out my history with this app without allowing Samsung to do a digital colonoscopy of me and my phone. So does this make my expensive watch that I used to love worthless? Wow, great customer service, people! #sarcasmfont"
"Too intrusive, let me decide if I want to give access to my phone and contacts, or whom I want to involve in the ""together"" feature. It's conduct like this that is tempting me to migrate to Apple.. I'm getting tired of Android (Google) , and now Samsung, in what seems to be a constant attempt to hoard my data and intrude on my privacy. Follow up: I decidded to erase my health data from Samsung servers. So, they have it set up, if you do, you will lose all your health data on your device also!"
"If I go to enter my dinner at 7.30pm the app tells me I'm over my calorie limit because it hasn't taken into account the calories burned ""at rest"" yet. It tracks this in realtime right up until midnight. It's annoying that I have to work out how many calories I'm going to burn myself and ignore what the app is telling me. Unless you enter your last meal right before it ticks over to the next day it's going to give you an inaccurate amount of calories you need to consume to meet your goal. Why?"
"Edited: I have called your 1-800 # and they couldn't help me.   I would like to add today my steps in the challenge are reversing. Like as if someone is hacking the app.  I started the day with 405,000 steps. Then walked 10,000 and it said I was at 411,000 steps in the challenge. Which was off by 4000. Then I walked 6000 more steps and now it says I only have 408,000 in the challenge. How stupid. I went from rank 14000 to 17216 while walking 16000steps.  --------  Does not record steps on phone. Works on watch. Tried everything to fix. Uninstalled and reinstalled and lost a whole days of steps in the step challenge. Not happy. Worked fine for 6 months then just stopped working."
"Warning! Disable updates for this app if you value your privacy! New versions of the app require a Samsung account. Newest versions of the app (as of a few months ago) require a cell phone for 2FA. I don't have a cell phone number. My wife's app updated, and now she has no access to health tracking details. I disabled updates, but need to find a way to downgrade to before a Samsung account was required. Oh, and now the email I gave Samsung to make the account gets newsletter spam that I didn't sign up for. With how much I paid for the Galaxy 3 Watch, and especially the fact that the ECG is disabled with all non-Samsung phones, this is a very unkind bait-and-switch. This is my 3rd Samsung purchase, and I'm not buying another Samsung product after this. Edit: Dear developer's PR department, If you're going to respond to reviews, at least read them first. I don't have questions, I have demands. Make the app that I paid $370 US for work without a Samsung account, like it did before. I should really give this a 1-star review, but the app, aside from the invasive 2FA requirement, isn't terrible."
"Update: I originally gave 5 stars for this app but I will have to update my rating to 3 stars. I'm not sure what happened but this app seems to miss a ton of my steps. I'm doing nothing different to cause this, so if I'm offered a feature I would like that that feature to work and work consistently. Oh I am currently using a Samsung Galaxy Note 10, my app shows updated and so is my device."
"If you charge your phone or just leave it on a table or a desk, this app will notify you a thousand times that you should not sit still for as long a time. In the middle of business meetings, it will make a high beep telling you've just passed an arbitrary steps pr day goal. This app is a spam generator preinstalled. Should never have been distributed by any serious business producing phones. I feel my s9 experience dropped 3 stars from a 4 to a 1 just because of this app."
"Awful Congratulations on crippling a perfect fitness app. By removing weight management you have effectively buried S Health. I was thinking of buying a smart watch, after being so delighted of your fitE band. I literally have zero idea how can somebody think of removing such features. Please, for the love of God, return them. For years I had tried lowering my weight and this helped me with 5kgs, when nothing else could. Now I have to search for previous versions, disable auto updates and so on"
"I love this app!! But I am having to clear the cache everyday and restart my 22S+everyday to get the steps to work. Now today after restarting it 2x its not working at all. I have also done what you suggested in the previous post, pausing my steps then restarting them as well. Just looking for a little help here as to what to do. Thanks in advance!!!"
"Please add a stroller pushing option for waking and running. I go for walks pushing a stroller and my watch has trouble tracking it. Because my wrist is not swinging, but it can tell I'm moving, it thinks I'm riding a bike. Even if I tell it before I start that I'm starting a walk it it dosen't get it quite right because my arm isn't moving. I can't be the only parent who walks/jogs with their little one along for the ride."
"This app now requires permission to make phone calls, why would this app needs that. I just use this app to measure heart rate and now I can't do that until I give them my data, I can't use a feature of my phone that I paid for until I give up my privacy. Thank you Samsung, way to spit on your loyal customers. I haven't bought any phone but Samsung's for past 6 years but now I think it's time to look for better brands."
I have not been assisted to change the contact cell number . I am not able to use the help function since I cannot login into the app. I have been sending emails without any help since December 2021. I cannot call customer care I'm in South Africa. It is almost the end of February 2022 I have not been assisted with issues I've had with the app since 2021. The help provided is on Q&A and none of these address the issue I have. It's very simple thing remove the cell number it no longer works
"This app is abysmal. I have been trying to log in, it won't let me log in via Gmail yet that's the only way I've logged into Samsung apps before, so I don't actually have a password. I created a new account and had to reset the password 3 times before I could actually log in. 2FA sent a code to my phone, the app REFUSED to let me input the code. My god."
Pretty easy to navigate.
"I love everything just... please 1. Make an update and let us edit our food 2. Let's see the average calories we're likely to burn by midnight by doing nothing 3. Allow us to customize our daily menus so that we can see how many calories we're eating, instead of putting it all in and having weight management tell us we're above our goal... Thank you üòò"
"Love this App but I got a new Samsung phone and I can't check my heart rate anymore or stress. I was able to add it to my list with my weight and water intake but there is no way to take my current heart rate. It just shows me what it was 2 days ago from my old phone. Do I need to search for a replacement App? Kinda bummed, really liked Samsung Health."
"Overall good app, but can we maybe link in 3rd party sites that are in English for the stretches and stuff?"
"Was ok, but the latest update means I can't use the heart rate and blood oxygen sensors on my phone without creating a Samsung account and sharing who knows what with them. Sorry, no, I'll live without. Is it too much to expect to be able to use the features of my phone, that I already paid for, without having to pay again with my data and ad views ?"
"The display on the home screen of my phone is so small now. The widget used to be a decent size, not huge, but not this small. If I get to 5 didgets in steps, it won't even show the 5th didget. The latest update must have done this. There is nobody to contact, so hopefully someone sees this. They need to change it back."
My experience has been great until they updated the app and now it only works if I allow Samsung Health to make phone calls. Why does a health app require that? Then when I denied it will no longer allow me to access the app. After years of using this app. I just uninstalled it. I have also been a Samsung user for years. I am questioning purchasing Samsung again. If this is what is required for the app. What are they accessing on my device? ü§î
"I began using this app after I purchased a Samsung Watch. I'm sorry Samsung, but Fitbit has a much better app. The Samsung health app is useful, but compared to the Fitbit app, it is quite sad. Samsung Health is the only calorie counter app that does not read barcodes. I don't like how it shows dials of where you should be in your calorie count. On the watch it only shows how many calories over or under your intake should be. I simply just want it to display how many calories I've burned."
"3 star rating is a downgrade from previous 5 star rating... > This app used to be great before the recent ""update."" Please bring back the ""grid view"" for the main screen as more information was available at-a-glance. New way looks old and wastes space and time as I now have to scroll down to view everything. Please fix this immediately! I've been using Samsung Health for 2 years since I first got my Galaxy S7 and was unpleasantly shocked to see the new screen this morning when I went to update."
"Had used this app a lot and liked it, but suddenly it won't open."
"This app would be 5 stars but Samsung puts Ads in their health app on their flagship phones? It reeks of greed and desperation. Common guys, you're making smart watches to compete with Apple. You gotta step it up. Is it really worth the small revenue to make your devices look and feel cheap? Edit : Check out the reply. If the app doesn't contain ads, why does it say there is ads right on the Google play page and why am I staring at an air miles ad right now."
I personally use this more than I ever thought I would and it is a great pair for my 46mm galaxy watch. Will continue to use regularly! I would like to see the app get better at catching cheaters in the monthly challenges. Currently the leader somehow walks 87000 steps a day. That seems unlikely to me but what do I know I just walk all day for a living.
"Used to be a good app. Then they got rid of weekly/monthly weight averages, which made it much less good but just about tolerable. THEN, they added a requirement to access phone/contacts. Unacceptable, with lame excuses offered by the developer. I uninstalled at this point and found an alternative. Do not waste your time installing this mess of an app. Samsung: time to LISTEN to the feedback from all the recent 1* reviewers and fix your app while you still have some users left!"
"The app is now forcing me to set up two step verification so it can use my phone number. I have zero interest in allowing my phone number to be used and do not want to allow this, so now I cannot use the app at all because there is no way to bypass it, the app will not open unless I comply. I can never remember my samsung account login and do not want to have to re log into all my devices if I change it just so this app will let me take my heart rate. I can just download a different app."
Worst app ever. When you change your phone. It is a nightmare to register this app. In your new phone. It will link with your email and will send some links which are inaccessible. Nobody will respond to your email. Please don't buy any gadgets linked with Samsung health
"Using this app for years and liked it, but the last update made it unusable. What's the purpose of tracking things if you can't see the thing you tracked as a report/historical metrics? All historical data (steps/calories/blood sugar/blood pressure etc) lacks week/month views. Nobody will scroll 1050 days to see how was their blood glucose level 3 years ago. Also, the weight history has only day view. How much someone's weight is changing from one day to another, to make any sense for having only day level view? I was using this app to track my health parameters (including glucose level and blood pressure) and see how was evolving over weeks or months (and had notes about what I did, what diet I was on, medication etc), and now, I can't see all this data properly. Also, I can't download the data, to move it somewhere else to see it properly (BTW - I think you are legally required to allow users to download personal health data - so at least add a download all personal data button)."
The sleep tracking is consistently inaccurate even when using my Galaxy Watch 4. The app keeps on thinking when I open it is when I'm done sleeping. I could be on my phone for an hour and if I don't open Samsung Health within an hour it'll be added to my sleep time. Bad bug. Otherwise this is a great app.
Could not get pass 2 factor authentication. Just bugged out. It had me go yhrough the process 3 times each making me restart at the put in ur password screen. Far to much work to even try even if it worked edit: i think the response bot gave is funny sense i clearly said its not worth the effort because i can download another 3x easyer
"I have been using this app until they (unnecessarily) required access to your personal phone info. I've read the recent reviews and I don't believe you need to monitor/regulate my calls or any other function, not related to your app. You insist it is for better accuracy, yet ALL your recent reviews since the update proves that your app has, infact, gotten worse! The regular functions don't work, because now the app is too busy monitoring things it shouldn't have ANYTHING to do with. Go back!"
There is no Pedometer. Or the word. Please stop saying that. The only thing it has is steps and there is no option for more. Still doesn't work. I was sent instructions for my steps. I don't have any of the steps provided other than settings. Honestly this app is useless. It'll show I've ran 20 min but my steps are less than 500.... and in all honestly the steps are on the activity (almost 4k) but not reflecting on steps. Makes me just want to uninstall.
"I have enjoyed this app since I first got it about five years ago. However, I need HELP with the cycling portion!! Most recently, my audio guide while riding has changed and no longer provides me with the verbal status of my average speed, distance, etc. Instead I get useless info like Elevation, Average Pace, etc. How do I get back the info I really want???? This rating would be higher if I can get the useful info to replace the useless info. THANK YOU"
"I am very disappointed with Samsung Health. It's step tracker has become the worse tracker ever. I've always been a fan with the precise calculation of their counter but it stinks beyond all measures. I did a 5000 step workout this morning and my steps with Samsung Health was at 4875, the tracker paused and or just stopped. I even shook my phone like crazy. The tracker on my workout steps caught up and passed my actual steps in Samsung Health. This needs to be fixed, for those who rely on it."
As a 3yr Fitbit user; I find this app to be less than average. With Fitbit I was able to see sleep stages & track hourly step reminder on the app. Also watch faces are not pretty. I only switched to Samsung because I want built in gps. I am strongly considering returning Samsung active 2 watch & purchasing a Garmin.
"I used to be able to share a copy of the route I walked. Now when I share, it does not show the background of where I walked, just the lines of my route. I have checked everywhere for a setting to change this, but to no avail. I enjoy sharing my routes, with family and friends, but now it useless."
"Not bad so far, pretty new to this but we'll update my review as I learn more about the app. One request I would like to make is for people like me on night shift that tend to split their sleep, not by choice mind you, just sometimes the life of a single parent in my case. But to be able to put in multiple sleep times for a day would br awesome."
"Awesome app, really fun, only complaint I have is during the monthly challenges there are tons of cheaters. People who actually walk for their steps can't possibly get 200k in one day. I think average is around 10,000 steps equate to 4-5 miles, that's pretty much 100 miles a day. Most people can't even do that In 48 hours. I'm not saying there aren't people who do that, hard core runners for sure. But I don't see them doing that days on end. Please fix!"
"Why did u get rid of the pulse ox, O2 monitor and the stress monitor!!!??? It was the main reason why I used this app. It was a quick assessment of my h.r. before and after exercise. As well as an informative way to manage my stress level. It's not even worth 1 star. Wish I could give it ZERO stars."
"Worked great up until now, now they force some Samsung account BS on you for no reason and you cannot use the app anymore. WHY? Why use something, that just worked to force something onto me, that I don't want? Erased data, and disabled (the one star is for the option to be able to do so). Do other phone vendors have better practices? I considered upgrading to an S21, once it is released, but I guess I have to rethink that..."
"I love the app, I just wish there was a way to add that your pregnant and keep track of things involving that"
how can I downgrade it to the previous version ????? I used to use this app every day but after last update I can't use it anymore .I try other apps but they cannot identify all the sensors of my phone. I can't understand the reason of changes in latest update . please give us an option to downgrade it or let us migrate to other apps. Or maybe I should buy an iphone . I think the boss must talk to samsung Health project manager .
Further update: Help is no help. Update 2022: Still woeful. External app needed to gather Garmin cycling data. Counts steps that don't occur. A complete waste for anything serious. I'm in Australia. Phone you in the US is your support answer? The sleep function is stupid: I go to bed at 20.30 & wake at 23.30 (then go back to sleep). That 3 hours is lost from the night's sleep despite my target set as 20.00 to 05.00.
"Updating 4-29-2021 üëéüëéüëéüëéüëé There is absolutely NO reason that Samsung needs permission to make system changes, make phone calls on my phone in order to use a HEALTH APP!!!!! This is a complete breach of privacy. That would be like handing over your ATM card with your PIN # to some stranger. INSANE!!! I've used this app for many years, but I won't be bullied into giving you blind access to my phone. I've seen some of Samsung's responses and that is a very weak and lame excuse."
my Samsung S8 plus Smg955u shows a pop up message saying it cannot open because my device is rooted. first of all it is not and i dont even know how to do that . i need help because i use the app with the heart rate sensors and for fitness. UPDATE: Thanks for reaching out in a timely manner i can now rate it at 5 star since everything is back to normal thanks for the assistance.
"I, like most people, used this app almost everyday for years and with the new update will not give permission to my phone calles; especially for a function I do not use. Even when I did initially give authorization the app got stuck on the 2 step verification. What a way to alienate loyal Samsung users. I do not need security for my steps and sleep cycle. Also regardless of what you say there is no reason to require access to phone calls when even banking apps do not require that."
missing o2 tracker and don't tell me to go to manage items and change the slider because it is not there either! you broke this app now go back and fix it! So I find out that you removed the oxygen saturation on purpose with no explanation why. Some people says you can check o2 on the stress test but guess what? NOT AVAILABLE in Canada. Are you serious?!! EXPLANATION PLEASE. and no I am not calling you.
"The new experience: i cant get my leader board to work either on my phone or on my watch. I miss the community board. I made lots of friends there and shared my workouts there. I loved the response I DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHY YOU DUMPED IT!!! BAD MOVE!!! The ""streamlined"" experience is like the experience of the 50% quieter fan... it blows 50% less! Streamlined just means LESS STUFF ! no good! I liked it the way it was! Streamline your own ears... not mine!"
"I don't like that you've removed the calorie management aspect of this app. It's the only thing I used as I track my food on another app. Can I have a refund for my Samsung watch please? Seriously though...I bet I'm not the only unhappy customer right now. Edit - if its true that this feature will be introduced again in the next update, my review would be 4 stars."
"Bad decision to require so many permissions to use the app now. Access to so much is not necessary for this app to run. Very sad, as other reviews show, we don't like this! Remove and I will use it again. I have read your generic reply to say what it is used for, you need to find a different way for the unique identifier to work other then my phone access.."
You state you need intrusive permissions to give an optimal experience. Actually you are demanding intrusive permissions before I can have ANY experience. I cannot use this app because I will not allow you to have permission to access my phone calls and contacts. These ARE NOT NECESSARY to access a watch which is happily measuring my activity. All I want is something to store the history of the records on my watch. If your app will not do this then I will get a new (non-Samsung) watch.
"Was a soild 5 star but they removed the weight management part of the app that actually changed my life for the better. UPDATE: I had to delete most of the review to add this. Hi support, I appreciate you reading my previous review and replying. I was just wondering if there's any update to reinstate that feature? Just really miss it. Please feel free to email me if possible."
Only good feature for running. Must provide more option for cycling too.
"I loved this app. with so many helpful items. The step tracker is great, along with the heart rate monitor. Unfortunately after one of the last updates they removed the pulse oximeter and I dont know why. It was a useful part of the app. I used it often to get my Mother in law to use her oxygen. Hopefully it will come back??"
"I have the band now for 2 month and had already 2times to uninstall and reinstall the app. It just didn't stop idling... its not two weeks and i have to reinstall again... and again one week later! I will not call any phone number! It is your responsibility to sell a working product... If it is not working, you get a bad review."
"Update ruined app. I was able to use the app for weight management with calories consumed and calories burned. I was able to better assess my nutritional needs and finally get my health in check, during Covid lockdown, mind you. Very disappointed. I had recommended this app to several people and now will be looking for a replacement."
"I loved using Samsung Health to track my steps over the years. Now that the app requires permission to access my Contacts & Phone, I've decided to shop for a new app. Your ""optimizing your experience"" explanation is BS as is your promise to only use it for blah, blah, blah. We all know once you have permission, you can do whatever you want. Not acceptable, especially for a pedometer app. Uninstalling."
Why after years of using this app has it suddenly stopped me from accessing it? I have been satisfied with all aspects but this evening as I tapped the icon for my walk I got a message to agree to the new usage rules. When I tap on agree I get the notice that I have to get to settings for permissions. I am now unable to access the app. What gives and why the problem after years of uninterrupted and satisfied use?
"Why does this app now SUDDENLY need PHONE permission? I cannot see my sleep and heart rate stats without it. It's not just an optional permission used for some remote feature, that I can enable at will. It is mandatory for app use. I am genuinely waiting for an explanation of this, no reasonable one comes to mind, I am half expecting this to be a bug. Edit: how is it that the app was working fine before without this permission? What is this phone permission even used for, exactly??"
"Work up to a VERY inappropriate spam invitation. Having never even used this app I wasn't happy to see the words (not blanked out) ""f*** me here"" on my lock screen. There wasn't a way of reporting this request but I did get a screen shot if someone wants to look into this. Edit - another inappropriate invitation. Will remove the app if this continues."
"My step count has been off for a week now on this. Sometimes it randomly pauses counting my steps, and my step count while I'm at work has only been averaging 4000 steps a day, when I used to average over 10000. I went on a walk with my wife and her account says she's walked over 5000 steps, while I only have 2000. I haven't had an issue with this app before, but now I can't use it for its main purpose."
New Update...in order to use I have to agree to have Samsung control to make calls on my phone....? Really...NO! I've read your explanation to the others who also hate the new update. This is Not just to install the App. This is to just into the App.. Change it back the way it used to be....I'm with the other recent reviewers No Thank you! Samsung DOES NOT need permission to make calls on my phone!!! I'm removing App!
"In my opinion ease of use and clarity of things isn't as nice as Fitbit. I may be biased coming from there, but the things I look for are just easier to see quickly on Fitbit. But I'm getting by due to the Samsung watch I was gifted for Christmas. Also today it's telling me I've burned 2487 kcal... that's 2,487,000 calories with only about 60min of active exercise time today. Seems a bit off. I think I'd be dead if I actually burned that many calories with so little active time."
"As per other reviews, S Health FINALLY got a feature to show net calories because most people don't burn the American average calories and it allowed us to bypass this and set our own intake versus burn. YOU REMOVED THIS FEATURE!!!?? Apps are supposed to get better with each update not worse?!? Update to my review: S Health responded but clearly didn't read what I wrote....you deleted features, you can't help me with something I can't access. Now looking for an alternative app. Atrocious!"
"Hi, After September update gw4, Samsung health on watch can't find my location for outdoor exercise. The GPS icon is flashing and doesn't get fixed. I reseted watch several time, but it was not resolved. I updated Samsung health but didn't solve. All apps and watch is up to date."
"I love this app.. but I don't like your privacy settings. My phone just updated and there is no privacy in this .. you don't pay my phone bill so why should I let you manage my calls, allow access to my camera, contacts, files, and media, You already have my email. Now I can't open the app until I allow you to access to everything why? I should be able to choose what permissions I allow on my own phoneüòí Not happy Can't answer you it seems most of the people ain't happy with the privacy setting"
"You got my review removed?!!!!??? I submitted a review saying Samsung makes enough money from their phones and watches etc that use this app, they don't need to put ads for their products in the app too! They responded and said there aren't any ads in the app...yes, yes there are Samsung. A big banner that scrolls through ads right at the top of the app. I got another email that they responded to the review again and I came back to look at the response and my review WAS GONE."
Ever since the most recent update this app has completely burned through my phones battery. Before the recent update the app wouldn't use up any battery (or if it did I didn't realise it) but ever since the update the app has made my battery worse and was most prevalent at night when it was used for over 7 hours. I was wondering if u possibly had a fix for it. My phone is a Google pixel 4a.
"I used to have the Galaxy watch 4 and was enrolled in the one UI program on it. At the same time I was enrolled in the Samsung Health Beta tester's Program.   I've since switched to the Galaxy Watch 5, and I don't know how to update Samsung Health now.  I think I'm still stuck on the beta version, it will not update in the Google Play store or in the Samsung app store.  Please help, I appreciate any guidance."
"Removing all updates until you make 2FA optional. Not giving you my phone and other info for a pedometer and pulse-ox sensor. Thank you for your reply. Apparently there is some confusion with the phrase, ""I am NOT going to give you my phone number."" The version that came with my phone works fine (with the only issue being i am required to manually start other updates) so that is what I will do until you decide to stop annoying your customers."
"I don't use ""health together"" and will not agree to 'make phone calls' Your 'assurances' are not sufficient for me to permit otherwise. I'll await a revision for a while but then uninstall if requirements are not reasonable and pertinent. You don't need direct contact to explain the issue. Simply addressing the overwhelming number if 1-star reviews submitted in the past few weeks would take care of our concern. Let us selectively opt out of features that require unapproved permissions."
Helped me lose weight but I cannot get the app back on my home page without going to playstore every time!
"I loved the program when I had my samsung S8, now I have galaxy A52 and it won't work. I have a medical issue that this program was great for monitoring it, now it does not allow me to record anything, just shows old stats. VERY DISAPPOINTED"
"I had it and removed the app from my phone, pity because it was a decent health app. It appears that every new update requires more and more permissions. Why do you need so much access to our personal files? I've decided to remove any app which requires unnecessary access to my personal data. Reply to the generic response from the developer. The app worked perfectly before and there were no special permissions required. I would install the app again if you removed all those requirements."
Since I've had this app it's been change to a point where the amount of information available to you has been reduced significantly. I no longer can see a day by day summary of my sleep easily. Give me easier access to my data! Whoever was in charge of rolling out this new update should be fired because it's beyond stupid.
"After the latest update permission is now required for the health app to ""make and manage phone calls"" and the app cannot be used without this permission. Permission denied so I won't be using this app, time to find a new health monitor app to use with my Samsung phone and watch. üò° Edit in response to your reply, thanks for your BS generic reply, it doesn't help at all!!"
"I don't want to participate in a steps challenge, nor be part of any team. Every developer response has a blanket statement: ""provide a better overall service experience"". Explain that. I couldn't care less about a together feature. From what I have read, no one had an issue with their experience. My experience was just fine. So explain how gaining my personal information (which you're not getting) makes my experience better? DO NOT RESPOND WITH THAT RIDICULOUS VAGUE STATEMENT EITHER."
I have been using this app for many years and this is the first time it has told me that I am unable join as the challenge has been capped. Samsung you are suppose to be encouraging people to become healthy and more active but this is having the opposite effect. I am going to buy myself a fitbit and stop using this app i will withdraw all permissions and I will start to move away from Samsung
"I had to update the app, now i cant access it, unless, I agree to, allow it access to my contacts make and manage phone calls?!? Why and what the heck for? Have to say goodbye to this new & absurd upgrade y'all have made to this. Loosing a ot of people to this. Update: The generic automated response to my complaint is not fixing, helping or changing minds on the acceptance of granting permission to access anything to my phone. You are loosing lots of people over this. Hope it was worth it. Bye!"
"Less than an hour after this ""updated"" when I continually get notices that ""there is not enough memory to update -please uninstall apps"" the battery started HEATING UP.. no matter what Verizon does to IRRITATE me into getting a new phone I'm NOT DOING IT until 5G is completely rolled out and stable...and NO I'm not going to get an ""upgradable contract"" BUT I just MIGHT go to another phone company."
"I will be uninstalling in January rather than making an account. I refuse to have my extremely personal information stored anywhere other than directly on my phone and making an account means that Samsung has all my information. This is unacceptable. I value my privacy. Samsung apparently does not. And no. I am absolutely not calling your phone number. This is absolutely ridiculous. If I could lower the number of stars for this, I would."
"I was using Samsung Health a lot for the Oxygen Saturation function. It was one of the deciding factors for me to purchase my phone. Recently, the Oxygen Saturation function disappeared. Apparently, it has been incorporated into another function named Stress. This Stress function, for some reason is not supported in Canada and a few other countries. Samsung could have kept O2 Sat separate for these countries but they didn't. People's interest in these countries has been disregarded by Samsung."
"Samsung, just had an update.... where has the weight management widget gone???!!! What were you thinking by removing it? Get it back on fast, before we all find a different app to use!!! This app was 5 stars with it; now bearly 3 stars. If anyone finds another app that has a similar weight management widget, could you post it in your review please? Thank you."
"Already phoned you and spoke to a representative, which took my information but got no response from anyone of authority. Provide me a way to roll back to the previous platform before the forced update. Do not like the changes made, let me return to the program they way I enjoyed using it. Stop messing with stuff that's not really broken,just to be doing something. Your not giving feature-rich when your taking parts away that users like and depend on to make the program enjoyable. Please respond"
Need Help! I am not able to log in to samsung health from Mi note 9 pro max. It's only saying something went wrong. Please try again later. I have changed password and tried again. It's not working in this device. Why are you destroing such a beautiful app. It's working on my old Samsung phone and iPhone 11 but not in this phone. Please help. Its working fine.
"Used this app for a long time, but have now uninstalled it. It is now too invasive. And I absolutely do not want two factor login for an exercise application. This is not a banking application. Samsung, think about what you are doing. Now I'm questioning future purchases of your phones and watches. You are making OnePlus look good. Fix this!!"
"Sounds to me like everybody is upset with your new app and your new updates and your new permissions and your new settings. Why not take these suggestions and ratings and do something about it you seem to have a canned message for every person. Why not take some of these suggestions and do something with your app good, you are way too invasive and way too aggressive with your apps and clouds. I cannot turn on my phone without having Samsung asking me to enter my information and give it more info"
"The ability the app is awesome, but tell me how you are going to have people that run almost 200km in one day? Your challenges are pretty useless and need to not even be on here if you are going to allow such nonsense on your app. Just get rid of the challenges and I would give you 5 stars. It stays 2 until you can weed out the cheaters!"
"So, I have to have my phone on my person to count the steps. It sure is easier and much more convenient to wear my Fitbit. I don't always have my phone on me. I also don't think the calories burned is accurate. I don't know how it figures it out, when it can't read my heartbeat. Since I can't connect with Fitbit, I won't be using this app, ever again."
"Sorry, I have to agree with all other negative comments here. Since the last update a couple of days ago it's completely gone to pot and won't at all. I've now had to uninstall it as I'm fed up with constantly getting messages popping up saying it's not working. When you've fixed it, I'll reinstall it and amend my rating accordingly"
Everytime you update this app i dislike it more. It is impossible to sync my gear 2 neo without reboot the phone and watch. Now you removed the 7 day step which I was able to compare myself with my age group. You keep adding things I don't want or care about. I don't like this update. I will probably find another app or another phone manufacturer.
"The weight management service is discontinued. It will be removed from this app in the next update. The response on this will probably be a support employee not being up to speed with this change in the app and needs me to call a phone number rather then explaining alternatives. Just answer the question, and stop copy/pasting."
"New update is rubbish and doesn't work. (Same as Google Fit!). Hugely inaccurate. Doesn't track exercise properly. Crashes all the time, particularly when I try to input data."
"Disappointing. Not as interactive as I expected with this phone & watch. Challenge feature, links to cookie cutter exercises & an info screen with no links to help decipher the semi inconsistent design of the interface, how your measurements are compared or calculated, help or feedback links."
"Was using app in hospital on S8 to see if SpO2 reading on patients accurate. If could get good photoplethysmography waveform displayed, then correlated quite well with hospital oximeter readings. If patient looked far better than ""always give an SpO2"" hospital oximeter, then no valid waveform seen. Was very useful in teaching nurses not to believe clinically improbable readings, but now have lost that functionality. Most asinine thing I've seen Samsung do and only reason got S8 was for this"
"App started consuming 60 to 80% of galaxy watch battery. Even after doing a reset and not allowing sensors and stuff, it still takes out the battery. It's really a pity we don't have an update on the app which will stop it using lot of battery"
"Good connection with Samsung Gear S3, disappointed with synchronisation with myfitnesspal, does not sync calorie or food intake very complicated to work it out. Other.than.tjat it's good and use it all the time."
"I find the sleep tracking function to be unreliable. This is very disappointing, I just purchased a new galaxy watch 3 to replace my fitbit versa, and the sleep tracker doesn't record any of my deep sleep or says I only have 5mins! In an 8 hour stretch."
UI looks visually good and user friendly. However the functionality is not on par yet. The step counter just doesn't work well on my phone model (OnePlus 6 FYI) which barely detects my foot step. Sorry uninstalled.
They removed the calorie tracker. I lost over 50 pounds when they had it tracking daily intake and fitneas. It was great I would know early if I was on track or needed adjustmenta. Will have to find a new app now.
"The recent update which enforced two step authentication makes it completely broken. The app takes you on an endless loop, on occasion showing random internal errors. Multiple resets and reinstalling the app didn't help"
"So disappointing! With S9 and Samsung Health I had a simple step counter and heart rate, stress and oxygen level monitor. I now have S20 and an app that does nothing useful for me. I've uninstalled and looking for a third party app. I don't have, need or want a 'wearable'."
"Its the best. Im all about the change it has brought to my life. Words cant explain how blessed I am blessed to have been able to finally buy a watch!! Best purchase i made, and worth it because of the app!! I love the global challenge, i push my self harder everyday since joining it! The app keeps track of my entire day!!!!! Cheers to bringing back the healthy me!!! #walkingthepoundsaway"
"As it seems with everyone else i have a problem with not being able to opt out of the more invasive permissions just to have a resemblance of functionality. I liked this app before but it's obviously time to move on. You lost another user because of invasive, unnecessary nonsense."
"Really great and amazing app overall. I constantly use this everyday for health and fitness. I use this to track my exercise cause I cycle everyday and I enjoy the comprehensive data i get from each activity. Thus, I bought gw3 to compliment and add more data because of the heart rate sensor. However, really got disappointed because it didnt consider such info for calorie burned. Please fix this."
"Good app, but I have a serious issue with adding food. My system language is English, but I live in Russia and some of the product name I could use only in Russian. My workaround was to switch system language to Russian, add my common foods to favorites, and than switch system language back to English."
"Good but flawed. Enjoy using this app but it does have a major flaw when used with the Galaxy Watch. When I cycle and start that as an activity it registers OK, however the phone registers that exercise as steps. When using the app with my previous GearFit I could show only steps recored by the GearFit in the step counter. However with the new Galaxy Watch that option is not there so it is grossly overstating steps. Please please bring back the feature to only show steps recorded by the watch"
I am Samsung Customer for almost 8 years. Had Galaxy Note5 which crashed after 4 years. I bought a new Galaxy M51. The default Samsung HealthAp looks like a stripped down version. The App don't have heart beat and SPO2 measurement feature which is very much necessary in these Covid times. I am disappointed that the feature has been stripped in default app in new Galaxy M51. Note5 had it and it was veryuseful. I'm not able to find or download the version from playstore as well. Please help.
Removed Spo2 measurement I use multiple times daily and replaced it with a stress test that takes 5 times as long and doesn't save data. Will roll back the update to get it back and never update well done Samsung as always keep making things worse and worse with bloat and more bloat. UPDATE: Went to APK mirror and downloaded the one before and got all my Spo2 data back samsung your terrible and the answers to people who have questioned it dissapearing are patronising. UPDATE 2: As if I will call
"What happened to the heart rate zones????? Its nearly impossible to do proper HIIT training without any heart rate zones üò§ I have used the Samsung Health app for 4 months. An update recently took place and they have removed the heart rate zones. It was bad enough that previously you could only see how many minutes were spent in each zone on that day, with no way to see it on the previous days. This app SUCKS. Seriously thinking about going back to Fitbit."
Buggy mess...can't even view my progress without the app crashing actually frustrating Update Did what was suggested still did nothing...won't sync properly to other apps. App crashes on me even after cache reset as suggested. I won't be calling as I may risk getting charged fees
Bring back the weight management tracker. Update: Thank you for the seemingly auto-generated response. Allow me clarify. A feature is now missing after the latest update. If you believe that providing me with a number will bring it back I'll absolutely call.
I have recently had problems with the app tracking my walking distance. I have turned off the battery saving functions and it didn't help correct. Open to other suggestions to solve. My app updates automatically so I am current.
"Keeps crushing on huawei p30 pro. Contacted support serveral times, they suggested usual practice with rebooting, clearin cache and data but nothing seems to work. Thinking to return my galaxy watch 3 since I payed so much for a product that don't have half of the apps working (health, pay, spotify, blood presure etc...) Would be better of with any other watch half the price of this one"
"Setup screen says Accept Marketing info (optional) Don't tick it and when you tick to agree to terms and conditions to get the app running it AUTOMATICALLY ticks accept marketing!!!! Rubbish Samsung. Great phone destroyed by greedy policies. Don't know what it is actually like as an app but I never will. An underhanded, devious, complete con. For my next phone I will search for one that doesn't try to hoodwink the public to terrorize them with nuisance push advertising at every stage. Samsung??   Thanks for the response Samsung.  For public consumption please explain why marketing is not optional and how it optimises my experience?! Samsung?"
I have reviewed the app once but I think I should have reviewed it more carefully. It was really great and it made me love Samsung more. My family and I have been using Samsung for over 10 years. I love the way Samsung cares about our customers through apps like this. It allows me to add other types of food with enough calories and other information such as the goal of sleep or exercise.. The image is actually 10/10. Everyone should discover this app!! Love you Samsung!
"After this last update it has now CONSTANTLY been saying that the app can not open in a rooted phone. I have force closed the app and STILL it opens on it's own and tells me the same message. I recently got a ""message was written in response to your review"" all they did was delete my review. So now it has gone down another star from 3 to 2 because there was no response. FIX THE ISSUE or I will uninstall and give an even worse review. Update: (05/11) the app is now working appropriately w/o issue"
I really like this app but there are a few things that frustrate me. The biggest one is that u have to manually update ur stepcount when ur doing challenges which can be very annoying. I would like for the new update to automatically update the stepcount for challenges in the background for I don't need to always manually update it and for the information to always be relevant. Please fix this inthe next update. Thank you
"New update with redesign is worse than the previous UI. Poor use of screen space compared to the last, prefered the large meter showing calorie goals, amd the tiled X-Y layout as of was before, and for some reason I can't add New food anymore...."
"Still frustrated that I cannot synch my Fitbit, as we were able to upload data in the past. Please add more smart watches to your list or return to allowing 3rd party appsnto synch out data. Will change rating once I can synch my steps."
Really great app. it lets you said your weight and height give you your BMI and calculates how much need to eat and how many calories you need to burn to lose a certain amount of weight based in how fast you want to lose it and it even takes into consideration the calories you burn at rest so it's pretty accurate. If I have any complaint it would be that the food nutrition library isn't quite as big as some of the more popular apps sometimes so I can't always find the foods I want to enter in
"Less user friendly. Old interface far better. App still suddenly decides to stop counting steps. When such ""up"" dates are produced uses should be offered the option to stick with the original."
"Since the last update, it wants to control my phone permissions. (They also make you login, so why the phone permissions?) No thank you. You never had to before, why start now? When you fix that, I will start using it again. Still gonna be a hard no! When you fix it, I will re-install it."
"Used to really enjoy this app, however it has suddenly stopped working. When I try to open the app I get an error message saying that the app can't be opened on a rooted phone. My phone is new, has only been owned by me, and I have never rooted it. I wouldn't even know how? I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app and I have cleared cache. I have emailed about this problem. Please don't reply to this review and asking me to phone regarding this problem because I am hard of hearing."
"I was really enjoying this app. However, suddenly all my information disappeared and I can no longer be part of the together challenges. In fact, I cant even open it. It continues to say that my account is not verified. Any help would be appreciated"
"The new design is terrible, had to go back to factory version. New version requires lots of scrolling to see and press simple buttons. Also I cant wait 15 seconds for app to open just to see steps I have walked!"
"I have been using this app for more than 5 years now. However became unhappy with the latest update. After that graphical representation of values over the period became useless. Moreover, average values made unavailable for Blood glucose, Stress etc. An update must make things better, but here it failed itd basic nature. 5 star would have been given for its earlier version. Based on your reply: If your tech team.are not abke to deliver it in an improved way, just rollback the version back.üò°"
"Ive been trying to open this app for over a month and it doesnt work. Keeps saying try again later. Ive tried uninstalling it and redoing it and still the same. Very disappointing I did call to get support. They said to reinstall, to do a force stop etc.... still doesnt work"
The app is great but would be nice if the food category was translated for every country as I find it hard to add what I ate. I always have to compromise because I can't find what I'm looking for and the results are inaccurate because if that. Maybe make this a community effort somehow
This app was great until the last few updates. Having trouble getting the app to sync with my Samsung gear fit 2 pro watch. The steps don't match. I rebooted my phone but it still won't sync.
"The app humors and allows cheaters for community challenges. I'll leave this at 1 star until samsung decides to fix this issue. Edit: Developer response gives me hope, but I am skeptical. Currently the leading champion has 2.1 million steps after 21 days. That comes out to 100,000 steps per day or roughly 44 miles. This is almost 2 marathons every single day! I am doubtful this is realistic and if it is, samsung should create a separate play area for these near gods among us."
"I'm not sure what happened but the Samsung Health Global challenge has stopped working for me. I enjoyed that app because it kept me motivated to try & reach my goal. Can you tell me what happened, I haven't been able to join the monthly challenge since July 31st."
Very useful app. I love using it!! I would just love to have the barcode scanner option available for food items as it is sometimes difficult to search for the specific item.
"Please bring back the monthly view feature for tracking weight/blood pressure, etc. I really miss these features. Im not a fan of the update**Update**I lowered my review from 3 to 2 stars. I waz excited to see there was an update in the app...and hoping they listened to everyone here saying to bring back the old features we all missed...dont know what they changed but it is still horrible. Like most people here i have since downloaded another app. This one is useless for me now"
"Was a great app to track steps, weight, heartrate etc but now useless as it wont let me authenticate on two step (I input my number and receive txt and input code but then it just goes back to the begining - after repeating a couple of times it rang instead and still did not accept the code typed in it gave me)."
Why was my review deleted.. I thought you replied to me about fixing the problem.. what kind of behaviour is this.. there is a problem with your app and you guys need to fix it.. which is that random adult events are started and I receive their notification.. wth is that.. Edit: the challenge is directly cancelled after starting.. it just gives that bad notification and I am not able to block them!
The weight management feature was the only feature that provided this app and their watch a competitive advantage over others. WHO'S dumb idea was it to remove it?! The app is useless now. MyFitnessPal is just better. Only Weight Management kept me using this one. Just dumb.
"says it won't open due to security and that it doesn't work on rooted phones. It used to work before the update. so, I deleted the app and restarted phone and reinstalled and now works great."
I used to use the app to check my oxygen levels. It was nice because I did not have to replace my oximeter when it stopped working. I changed phones it updated and that is no longer a feature. So I bought a new oximeter. I didn't use the app to count steps or monitor my sleep. For me the app is no longer useful.
"started my quest on June 6th of 2019 just on my Samsung Note 8, saw that I was making progress and enjoyed the metrics of progress. So i purchased my Samsung Active a couple of weeks ago and now im on fire. Samsung keep updating the app especially on the food part some foods are hard to find even with Bixby Vision and portions can't always be accurately be customized. staying focused and motivated love Samsung the best."
"It keeps causing my phone to crash. What is the issue? I dont even open this app. Error message ""Samsung health keeps stopping"" and when I send the feedback, nothing change. I've cleared the cache, tried restarting. What is the issue?"
"This app was great until the last update. I don't consent to this app managing my phone number, phone calls or contacts list to ""find my friends "" to exercise with/against them. I don't consent to 2 step verification either. Nor do i accept that it is for the betterment of my app experience. I have now deleted this app... it is pure shite!!"
"Caffeine intake tracking removed. This is my most used feature after sleep tracking. Horrible update. Can't even use it on my galaxy watch anymore. Not happy. I'll just use the water intake thing to count coffee now. That'll mess my data up good! I have a suggestion, if you keep removing things for legal reasons like your calorie tracker, just give us a blank and un-named item we can use like that tracker or caffeine intake tracker."
"You can't even set your max heart rate, and the number it assigns you is totally off, so all the HR zone information is useless. This cannot be used as a serious training app. It's too bad because the app has a good look and feel. I can't believe no one on the Samsung team stood up and said this is stupid and tried to do it right."
The inappropriate stuff has finally disappeared. Thank you. It would be really helpful if you could scan food items to fund them quickly and also a place to add the grams per serving when you add food not found.
Not the same without the weight management function. I was considering to buy a samsung health device to track my daily activities and leverage the weight management functionality. I'll have unfortunately to look for other options. Really too bad!
I think the app is awesome but I'd love to be able to manually record steps. I have a step counting device but it's not compatible to connect to the app so being able to add the steps I've done for the day would be great.
I hate the new updated format. I lost data history as well with the update/upgrade to the new format. I have been using it everyday for over 7 1/2 years. Very disappointed.
"Was a great app, but not so much anymore. You cannot differentiate your steps from your phone and your watch so the steps are inaccurate. The app also no longer syncs with other apps (ie. Myfitnesspal and go365) please fix it ASAP or i will be uninstalling."
"Terrible app if you want to use it with your Galaxy watch - there are many sports in the app, but they can't be import into the watch. For example SQUOSH I have to play SQUOSH measuring my activity with my phone in the pocket instead of my watch"
The latest version of this app (as many have stated) has removed one of its key and most useful parts. The only thing I use this for now is a step tracker which syncs with myfitnesspal which does the job samsung health used to do. Bizarre move really.
"My husband loved this app on his phone. Today, he played golf and ran errands for 4 hours and came back with 138 steps. I don't think so! He's not happy at all. I've tried everything, including uninstalling and reinstalling. Didn't work. It was mentioned on someone else's post to go to ""get help""... don't see that anywhere on the app."
"Generally this is ok, but you've taken away the ability to see weight by week and month, really missing it and looking at another app to fill the void. Would really appreciate more history on weight. I'd rather pay than have ads."
It works ok...but I'd like to add more food items but there's only a 100 item limit plus I can't see where there's a way to delete some food items so I can add some more. Very frustrating!
"After the update it no longer syncs with MyFitnessPal. Since Samsung health does not offer a barcode scanner for food, this is a real inconvenience for me. Looks like I'm going to have to ditch Samsung health all together and only use MyFitnessPal."
"I've used this app for years and since the recent update I can't get past Two-step verification. Regardless of if I opt ""Not Now"" or try to activate it, the app stops working and comes up with an error."
"The lastest version has runined my galaxy watch 3 battery life like all others have pointed out. From the wear app, it consumes about 70% of the watch battery life (3 days of charge into 1 day and sometimes less than 1 day). Beyond that it now needs access to contacts and phone to function. I've tried restricting permission but no luck. Uninstalling is the only thing that restores battery life. Wouldn't be surprised if the next wave of watches magically don't have these battery issues"
"Most recent update took away the part of the app I used and relied on 90% of the time, the weight management. It honestly feels like the app is almost useless for me now. Please, please bring back weight management!!!"
"I love this app, It's exactly what I needed to track exercises and motivate me to go faster/longer. My only complaint is I wish it had a verbal ""Exercise Stop"" when I end the workout. I need that because my phone will end in pocket sometimes without my knowledge."
"Great app but could be better. Does the basics but would be much better if you could add your own custom exercise sessions and manually enter calories, duration for that session. Also more reports/graphs would be really beneficial"
"I was able to lose 10 pounds using the weight management and this app was very helpful to achieving that. After this update they got rid of the weight management tool for no discernible reason. App is useless now, very disappointing."
"I used to mainly to check calories, steps & heart beat. But since downloading this app to my new samsung A202F/DS I cannot use the following: heartbeat, stress level, bpm. The fingerprint sensor does not read these! I am extremely disappointed."
"Hello, the app is not recording my steps anymore. I tried to change couple of things in the app itself, but it still not works. And before someone ask, yes the location is on. Please fix it with the new update. / edit: if you can give me a phone number in Uk im happy to call."
"This app is the best. Im trying to keep track of my sugar levels and it has the actual quantity of calories of any random food as a peanut butter sandwich! Litterally you can search for anything you like! It also comes with fat burning and meditation programs, it helps you get on track with your sleeping and even MORE! Samsung users are VERY lucky. And PD samsung co: Thanks for the app just a recomendation, can you add an option to be less than 18? Im young, but Id like to stay healthy"
Last 2 updates hace been terrible. No weight tracking view anymore. And now the app needs phone permissions. No way! And I've read all the useless Samsung responses. No real reason for the new permissions. My Samsung watch is pretty useless without this app. I've bought Samsung products for years but you've seriously damaged my opinion with this. I suggest you back track or all these formerly happy customers will go elsewhere.
Samsung deletes 1 star reviews so... Took 3 attempts to install before it worked. Doesn't let you change personal info more than once. Glitch on Samsung S9. Overly complicated UI. Compares you with other people like apples and oranges.
"The previous version has built in heart rate monitor, oxygen level sensor, stress management sensor and so much more. I get it. You removed everything in hopes of we would buy the unnecessary gadgets like belt, watch etc attachment. What a scam. I will download free heart rate monitor and forgo the rest. Old Samsung is so much better. This really is not nice after being a loyal customer for 7 years owning 4 samsung smart phones. 1 S4 and 3 Notes. Not to mention Chromebook, TV and Netbook."
"I really like this app, especially the monthly step challenge. However, there are clearly a lot of cheaters on the challenge and that's frustrating because they skew the results."
O2 saturation feature disappeared. Total failure to measure pulse after app updated. When hiking a hill it irritates me with 'activity paused' voice alert repeatedly even if i stop fr a few seconds to catch my breath. Tht also affects total hiking time as it gets paused.
I really enjoyed the app. But now its stuck at 2 step verification. I can't go past it even after entering the correct otp a million times. Trird uninstalling and reinstalling as well but of no use. It suddenly became waste.
"This app used to have everything I needed. Now, however, I have no way of monitoring total calories burned. It's absolutely ridiculous. I bought a Galaxy Active 2, and now half of what I used it for is gone. Such a waste of money and I regret ever switching from my fitbit."
"I would like to add to the other voices here complaining about the removal of the weight management feature, as well as the caffeine intake monitor. This used to be the Cadillac of health apps, now it's just a pedometer. Please bring back the features that have been removed, it's so much less useful without them."
"I've been using this app for several years but since I upgraded to the Samsung S 51 it no longer works on monitoring heart rates or stress levels. The activity, food entry, and manual weight entry are the only things that still work."
Very much like this app for fitness tracking. Makes Canadian winter nights a lot more of an adventure. I have a question though: how can I share my route without having neither the stock image or one of my own in the background? I want the streets I was on to be clear. Thanks!
Hate the new updates. I liked the ability to view weight by weekly or monthly but you can't anymore. Also it's asking for more permissions to even be able to open it?! Completely unnecessary and I'm not allowing more permissions than what I already had. App was great but now it sucks and I no longer use it.
Very disappointed and upset that they took out the weight management category. Was very helpful when it comes to managing your calorie intake and burned. Not sure if i want to keep using this app due that.
"Everytime I opened the active time card, the app closed. I was contacted by the developer who advised me to delete the cache of the health app. That fixed it. Great customer service *****update**** PROBLEM has returned again. Not happy. I've had garmin connect for several years and it just works. Now regretting asking for galaxy watch 3 for Xmas might have to return it"
"once again the app crashed, complaining that the phone is rooted, but it isn't. not the first time either. have cleared the cache and reinstalled the app several times with the same result. it catches every time"
This is on on my new Samsung A50 phone and although I've tried everything the app won't count my steps. All permissions are set and I've contacted Samsung for help but none of if has worked. Not too happy with it! My wife uses it and has no problems at all.
"I use this with a Samsung Gear2 Neo (D209) watch. Samsung Health v6.9.0.055. Samsung Gear v2.29.20012861. Samsung Plugin v2.2.02.18120361. Samsung email below is no good. Latest update to Samsung Health has caused problem with sleep data disagreement between watch and app. Prior to recent update, phone and App data matched. now app shows almost all restless and a bit light sleep, no motionless and watch shows mostly motionless, small amount light, very small restless for same time period."
"Edit 8.10.21. Issue below has been sorted. Still wonder why a new piece of kit was released with such poor testing. Now works as expected. Updated to the Galaxy Watch 4 now heart rate barely measures, I have no stress and all of a sudden my electronic weight scales no longer syncs to samsung health. Samsung beginning to test my patience and loyalty big time."
"great all in one app... but it DOES NOT TRACK SUGAR... it gives sugar info for individual items, but baffled why it does not totals sugar for the day. This is critical for diabetics & pre-diabetics that need to track total sugar. Need to get another app for food to track sugar. Disappointing. Tried calling the 800 number and they were of no help as they only troubleshoot and not take suggestions."
Love it!!! Helps me a lot to track and monitor my workout programs and my food. Very simple to use and has a lot of options to adjust to your needs. And its all free. Amazing!
4/14/21 - it took 3 months but I'm glad you added the weight trends back in the recent update. Thank you and don't make those awful updates again removing features we are used to! 2/27/21 - still not fixed with recent update! 1/24/21 - Samsung - when are you going to fix this app so we have weekly and monthly trends for weight again? The primary thing I used in this app was the weight trends with weekly and monthly averages and the update removed that feature. Please add this back to the app!
"I love what this app can do and the bonus is it's readily available and free. But I wish these improvements: 1. Enable user to amend amount of calories burnt while doing exercise (without wearing gadgets like smart watch). For example, with my recumbent bike for 1 hour, my bike record calories burnt 345, but with existing cycling mode in the apps, it's about 300kcal and exercise bike mode, about 500kcal. 2. Add calories burnt while driving in the active mode, because we do burnt calories and get tired driving. Thanks."
"Used to be a great app for tracking sleep, activities and a very good period tracker on this too. I got myself a Samsung Watch too, to go along with it since I have been using Samsungs since the S3 series. But this new update and wanting permissions I do not want to give has put me right off. Samsung seems to like to keep filling it's phones with bloatwear and unnecessary apps you cannot remove. Next upgrade in 5 months and I'm going to apple. Shame because my S20 is a good phone."
Since the new version 6.11 with the weight management feature missing it is now useless to me and many others from the looks of things. It's one of the vital features for most people. Please put it back into the app.
please add a barcode scanner for the food log. makes it more accurate for logging and makes it a more positive experience. searching through the list of food is discouraging. I use another app instead.
After this last update it is not working at all. Steps are not being tracked and information is not being synched Why did you have to mess with something that was working great and not broke! Totally worthless. Fix it back to the way it was or at least give option for us to undo this last update. Went from 5 stars to 0
it is a great app however it gives u a calorie reading that isn't the greatest and it can remind u about goal . also it helped me remer to set alarm so that can be close to the recommended amount of sleep because before at most I had 3 to 4 hours of sleep now I have 6 which is great water is also great and so u don't pee unexpectedly love app and trained body and this is just something for me it gave me ideas to exercise like archery
After swapping from garmin to Samsung I don't like this app. The heart rate graph in app is not detailed enough. The graphs made during excersize mode are how the graphs should be all the time. Looking for an alternative app
I love the app but everytime I try to open it it wont let me because of some rooted error?? This happened before and I was able to fix it but lost all of my data by doing so... the error just popped up again and I don't know how to fix it this time üò´
"Not a bad app, would like to see the addition of a barcode scanner for foods. At present I link it to myfitnesspal but the sync is horrible from myfitnesspals side , would do away with that if s health had few more things added."
"Cant get past the 2 step verification process...just keeps running ya in circles, have been sent over a dozen verification codes and they all just lead right back to same screen to get a code, will find an app that is actually user friendly!"
"quite annoyed that I cant link to my virgin pulse account anymore since the upgrade. virgin pulse tells me I need to change my data permissions in settings for reading step count to be enabled and I try to that. No matter what I do, I cannot edit my data permissions"
"Latest update is rubbish!!! Nothing works properly, everytime you add a weight you have to scroll from 2kg which instantly makes you feel rubbish! Plus it wont let me input my height so wont calculate BMI. Absolute nightmare, wish we could go back to how it was!"
The step tracker has been super inaccurate for a couple of weeks :( Update: i just saw that the weight tool was removed. The only reason i had this app is it tracked my weight loss. I cant believe i almost bought a galaxy watch! Sad to see this go!
"Took up 120mb on the phone. uninstalling updates took that down to 31 or so. System app. Wanted access to contacts for some reason... and seemingly every other permission. Phone's not rooted, unfortunately, so can't uninstall. Can at least disable. if i wanted an app that would track my breathing, heartrate, sleep, probably when i 5hit, well I'd install it. Maybe i should just chuck the phone out a window. Best case scenario, pure bloatware. Worst case, pernicious spyware."
"I've been using this for 2 years with the Samsung gear working pretty accurately. Oct got note 9 with galaxy watch & all the sudden it says I'm sleeping 15-18hrs a day! Even on bedridden days that doesn't happen. How can I be REM/deep sleep when I'm on a call, playing a game, YouTube ect.? Please adjust, recording my sleep is very important right now."
"Why do I have to give permission to make and control phone calls to this app? Reply: I've been using this app for years, but the recent privacy notice update is the issue. This app does not need permission to access phone calls for any functions so it should not be asking for it. Looking at these other reviews I'm not the only person who thinks so either."
"Realllyyyy frustrating. I run and I finished the goal but i did not click finished because i was not at my home yet, but unfortunately my phone died right when i got home. And when I turned it back on it say workout unclomplete. It didn't let me mark as complete but i had already complete itüò°. So i am deleting this app and finding a better one."
Doesn't match personal settings. I am a male and the app clearly shows women workout programs. It is great that they offer programs for women but they should be providing workouts for all people. Very dissatisfied with this app right now.
"The heart rate sensor works too quickly. it seems to measure the first couple of beats then alter the reading slightly for the final figure. my consecutive readings can be from 48 to 60 because of this, on a S9. I'm sure it would be a lot more accurate if it took 5 more seconds to measure. BTW, my HR is very steady and i take patient's HRs manually numerous times a day"
"Why isn't there a weekly and monthly step and mile total? I don't want to see my ""average step count."" I'm regretting buying a watch that syncs with this app. Also since the latest update, excercises aren't properly tracked."
"This app worked perfectly for me while I was using my Samsung Galaxy S7 edge, but with my new Samsung S9+, I can't download it! It just keep waiting for wifi even when my data is on. Thank you for your response, but the issue here is the contact number sent to me can't be reached, I have been calling but it keeps telling me the number you dial is cracked. Am writing from Africa, Nigeria."
Since update I am unable to open this app for more than a few seconds before it crashes. I've cleared caches and restarted and reinstalled etc etc but same issue continues. I basically can't see any of my activities any more. Help
"Excellent on the whole, BUT, there are times when the steps randomly stop registering and phone needs to be reset before it begins again. A real pain if you haven't noticed for several hours of activity."
"I would like the app more if it offered Kettlebells as an exercise activity. Seems to have more niche options, such as, orienteering, for activities than general options. I had to look that up on google to find out what it was. Even Noom recognizes kettlebells as a stand alone workout. Catch up Samsung."
I enjoy the challenges. However there are people who are definitely cheating. Unless humans can walk or run hundreds of miles in one day. It looks like they're counting when they're in a moped or other motorized vehicle. They need to fix the settings because it's not fair for the rest of us who are actually walking and running. What's the point of a challenge when people travel a hundred miles on day one?
Many thanks for your quick response. I can confirm the latest version 6.15.1 solved my login issue. The app downloaded my stored data and it works fine. Very impressed with new graphics and will give the blood pressure tracking a go later.
Very poor sleep monitor. Maybe it's the Samsung Galaxy watch but it should have last more than 2 years. It worked great till a month ago. I even turned off the heart monitor for REM. It just measures motion and says I slept for 3 hours. It was easily 7.
"I would have given 5 stars if it had a feature to view weekly or year summaries (not average, but total count of steps, active time etc.) It would be perfect. Please add that feature. Thank you."
"After the update yesterday, 8/10/20, my watch and phone are out of sync. The developer responded, I called customer support and after clearing my cache, my phone and watch were back in sync. I'm very happy. Thank you Samsung! ‚ù§"
It's a great app to keep track of routine activities and monitoring health on a regular basis. But considering the current scenario it would be great if the option record temperature is added in the app.
Hi Dear. It's great app. I've been using the app for long time and it was great but 2 days ago I format my phone and install the app again. Before when I do my running workout it Gives me a notification when ever I complete 1km. But at the moment doesn't give me any notification. I mean doesn't say 1 km been completed. Could you please help me with this issue. Much appreciated Jaffar Hasan
"Great app ... three issues. 1. Who decided the best screen in full daylight is unreadably dark? 2. Please make a setting for""during an exercise"" to keep from changing screen views easily when I am exercising. 3. How does the app reset itself to zero data? How do I recover it?"
"The app is great, but when I manually enter my weight for a different day and time for days that I forget to enter the weight, it doesn't let me hit ""enter"" button. Other than that, the rest of the app works well."
"The version I have refused to work unless I granted Phone call permissions. I don't see why the app should need that. I granted it and then removed it, and the app works again, but seems dodgy to me. If it's really needed then the message should state why so I can make an informed choice."
"Did a ""get there first,"" challenge finishing in 2 days but app glitched and I was not awarded first place. Other then glitching the app is good. *Applied recommendations and it still shows I lost to the challenger. Will not change review until it shows I won."
"I have used this app for almost 2 years now and loved it, but the most recent update now has it to where I cannot log my food properly. It won't search items and I've tried starting and restarting the app, my phone, and it still just isn't working."
In all conscience I will not let others to be fooled by this app. Specially the sleep one. All the datas are fictions and fake. I compared these to other devices and it confirms my doubt of the results. I normally sleep between 5 to 7 hours and most of the time I am given 20 hours sleep periods. And most of the time the sleep begining and awakening is totally wrong. Please don't loose your time on that app.
"I am see there is no proper track during my walking. If the mobile is inside the pocket, counts is not been recorded properly. As organisation competition I am using another third party ""Walkers for Life"" app. On comparing with this app there is huge difference in the number."
"Love this app! It starts automatically as you start moving and love adding my food intake, along with water and heart rate. The one thing they could improve is the food information; either too many similar options (ie muffin, chocolate muffin, choco muffin, etc) which is confusing or can't find the item I'm looking for."
"Ongoing issue with syncing data to strava. Apparently it may only sync once a day which is rubbish compared to other apps such as fitbit and Garmin which sync straightaway. Same issue logged from others over a year ago so come on Samsung, get it fixed.. Please"
"As an amendment to this review Samsung did not answer my question on why my watch does not track my heart rate when I exercise and have the app active. Am I doing something wrong or is this the way it is supposed to work. I really like this app. It does everything that I want it to do. It checks heart rate, stress, sleep and more. I use it to walk and it allows me to set a goal, then tells me when I have reached the goal. It will tell you if you have had your best time, distance etc. The one thing I do not like about it is that the heart rate on my watch does not function when I am doing my walks. It is minor but I would like to check on occasion during my exercise."
Update: You just lost me. Permission to make phone calls is too much. There is no need for this. This app has gone downhill recently. Used to be very good. Now much is gone from original app and it wants to many unnecessary permissions. Uninstalling.
"I have used this app for years. Today I got a new phone and can no longer log in. I spent almost $400 on a galaxy watch that I can no longer fully use. I get the infinite loop after sign in every dang time. I have cleared the cache, cleared data, restarted phone and uninstalled and reinstalled the app multiple times. What a collasal disappointment. Wish I could give 0 stars."
"Have used for quite some time to track walking distance. Latest Update will not allow me to use without giving permission for app to have access to contacts etc. etc. Never mind Samsung, there are other apps that do same thing with less hassles. Good bye"
I love it. it helps me track everything I need to. keeps me on track and focused on my goals. Only downside is all the cheaters in the global challenge. There is no way these people do 80+ miles everyday. Especially when you look at some of the profile pictures. Some of them have even broke the Guinness world record for walking (nordic walking) which is around 128 miles in one day. All these people do is devalue everyone else's achievement and it grinds my gears.
Too intrusive with new update....uninstalled Editing to drop from 2 stars to 1. Keep seeing the same robotic Samsung responses to our almost identical complaint. What we want obviously means nothing to you or maybe enough people accepted your terms so you just don't care. It's just an app. Why couldn't you just leave it as it was. What optimal advantages are worth all these disgruntled customers? No robotic response required.
"Bring back the pulse ox!!!!! I purchased a Note4 way back in the day (and have subsequently upgraded to each Note thereafter) because it meant I could carry around one less medical device for my medically fragile children. Without the pulse oximeter function, I no longer have reason to stick with Samsung. I just upgraded to the Note 10+ and it doesn't have the stress monitor which means no pulse oximeter again"
"I really enjoy everything about this app except that I can't add my workouts, they have to be timed in real time. I wish it would be changed so that you can either time your workout as you're doing it or add it after the fact."
"it would be a nice feature to be able to enter workouts after doing them, rather than having to start the workout timer before starting. My phone stays in the locker at the pool so starting before adds about 15-20 minutes to the workout due to showering and everything else."
"I liked this app before it was redesigned. Now it doesn't work at all. It doesn't sync with my Gear or My Fitness Pal like it used to. Because of this it doesn't show all of my steps, excercise, food or sleep."
"The app has been working very fine until within one week recently I can not sync the sleep data from my Galaxy Watch to the app. Everything can still be synced, though, except for the sleep data. Please fix any bugs that are probably related to such issue. Thanks"
Samsung fixed it. Thank you. Since I now have a Note 20 this feature isn't available. I would like to see blood oxygen on the Active watch series. It is importance in sports and workout tracking.
"Stop using the app 04/15/21 (after my phone updated yesterday) which was working great for me until it wanted access to phone and info which it didn't need to work because it worked before without access to my phone. It doesn't matter if the program its using it for anything, the fact that it has permission to use is mandatory that is the problem."
"A good app that has lost its primary function ever since Samsung removed the ""weight management"" feature. They recieved such a large amount backlash when they removed the feature it's absolutely mind boggling that they Still haven't brought back the weight management feature"
"With all the data capture particularly when paired with a Samsung watch, its disappointing it provides so little insight into one's health. Makes you question what the data is being used for if not for health insights."
It used to be good. They took away the weight managment feature. So I went back to my fitness pal and just used this app for the step count. It would share my step count with my fitness pal. With the most recent update it no longer allows my fitness pal to vet my step count. This app is no more than a glorified diary now.
The most recent update made this app less than useless. The weight management feature is amazong and losing makes the app unusable. I had to manually install v6.10 to get it back and disable auto update to keep it. This is unacceptable.
"The new update is awesome af. The automatic sleep record is just so good. Now everytime im late on group meetings, im showing them what time i slept to prove that i really did something overnight. And the interface is cleaner and detailed ever. Nice."
"I loved this, until it stopped syncing with my calorie counter/ IF tracker. That I've payed for. So I'm stuck with adding in everything manually. If I didn't just buy a galaxy watch, I would turn this off completely."
"Although I am satisfied with this app, I would recommend adding yardwork to the exercise portion. I know I get lots of exercise hauling/chopping wood, raking up/down sloped property, weeding, digging, mowing, etc. Also, doing housework. Thank you for considering this option."
Must have an option to NOT REQUIRE notifications. Requires a ridiculous amount of control over my phone. I will never use this app until this is fixed. I may even stop buying Samsung product. Update-the response from Samsung does not justify the need for access. They need to rethink their approach.
"Overall, a good app. Upon update to Oreo, had some problems with app indicating phone (Galaxy Note 8) was rooted, when it was stock. Per instructions from Samsung and some help pages online, had to clear app cache, then uninstall / reinstall app twice before got it to work again."
I don't understand why it only tracks steps when walking and not running. There is also no working interval activity. I'm a runner and both these features would greatly improve user experience.
"I was very disappointed to find out that the Note 10/10+ do not come with sensors so now I can not use my phones to take my heart rate and my stress level (including my Oxygenation Level). I had a Note 8 and it did all of that. Now I have to use a watch to those health trackers. If I would have known, I wouldn't have upgraded to a Note 10. I would have stayed with the Note 8. I was told that they sacrificed the sensors for the extra lens. John"
"good, I use it everyday. just would like to be able to manually add your distance if you forgot to start the ""Inline skating"" app. tracking distance is huge for me as well... year end stats would be nice"
"Recent update requiring permissions to access my contacts, location, camera, etc is way to invasive. You do not need this access to use this app and requiring a two step verification is ridiculous, granting those permissions allow Samsung access anytime they want and I'm just supposed to accept they will never have a data breach or collect data unbeknownst to me, sorry i lost any trust in any corporation keeping my info safe"
Near Useless. After several Android updates it appears to be Not working again. When I am walking it pauses. When I go for a ride it counts time but Zero Km. Cleared Cache. Restarted phone. I give up. It's only good for counting steps now.
"With the new update Samsung want my permission to allow them to be able to make calls from my phone. That's really not necessary to count my steps. Not impressed. Whilst I have a response from the developer saying they won't share my information, I still fail to see why they need to be able to make phone calls. Unless this changes I will not use the app."
"This latest update with two step verification is the worst. It makes me agree for everything before login. I can't login as the login session expire, please login again, and so on. Everytime I restart the app, the message is the same, and can''t open it."
"Samsung changed the app in January 2021. All history is on a rolling average. I used to track exercise by day, week and month. Now it's day, the last 7 days, the last 30 days, etc. Looks like my next watch update will be back to a fitbit."
"Dear Samsung Developers Samsung health is the best tracking app i have used until now. I am a regular smoker and i realy want to quit smoking, i have to go and get third party apps to keep track of my vitals vs smoking. it would be great if such a plugin be added to record smoking, the adverse effects on the existing health data, reduction in goals achived etc. now i understand that each and every brand of ciggret has different composition of its ""ingredients"" but i suppose it can be easily managed by the users, by creating their brand with its composition in the same maner as different types of foods are added and can easily be searched and added by other users to their daily intake. a widget for wearables would be highly appriciated. A whole lot of people might also want to quit drinking also. Sincerely,"
"Downloaded onto new mobile, gone through all steps to login. Even changed password, text verification and still won't login, just see blank screen with turning circle, nothing happens. Have tried 3 times, feel like giving up!!!"
Won't even display today - I've been relying on this app for over a year. I use it daily. It's very helpful. But starting this week it won't show the current day. It's confusing and makes it difficult to use. Please fix it. I really don't want to look for and get familiar with a competitor app.
The app was good until they removed oxygen sensor option! They say go to stress setting but it's not available in Canada. I've been a faithful Samsung user almost 10 years now & niw my next upgrade I may have to choose otherwise. I used the sensor for health reasons & now I cant
I wish it was harder to find people to become friends with and more challenges like the Iphone apps fit watch and Fitbit apps. Other then that it does a great job tracking steps. it doesn't sync up well with say under armour app or even myfitnesspal pal. using multiple apps to get into one app say Under Armour GIVES false/double readings
"It's an app I use the most. It's a great way to keep track your workouts, diet, sleep patterns, weight and so much more. I have gotten a few friends on it too and we challenge eachother which makes it all the more fun."
"I can't get in the app. After signing in it just stays loading all the time and I've tried signing in many times, turning off my phone, uninstalling and installing the app again but nothing works."
"Its been 2 months, your rating went from 4.4 stars to 4.0. You have changed things very little people care about but taking away things most people use the app for. ""Our app developers have been notified"" either they aren't, or they are doing a very bad job. Listen to your customers and stop changing things and bring back Weight Management!"
"It's a fairly good app, but it detects ""workouts"" and then just assumes you've been walking. I just cycled about 10k on a mountain bike and it says ""Well done for walking a little bit!"". How it can confuse cycling with walking when it must see the GPS trace I don't know, dunno about anyone else but I can't walk at an average pace of 12mph"
"Since the latest update, cycling feature pauses and resumes the workout at its own. It used to be good, as expected before the update. But not anymore. PLEASE get the cycling feature fixed."
The app needs to be running all the time in foreground to record the exercise. Once the app is closed or phone is locked it stops record workout.. earlier version was much easier and compatible.
"Used to be excellent app, with an ability to log upto 6 distinct meals a day. But the recent update has reduced it to 4 meals. I much prefer the earlier feature than the new. Any chance of getting this addressed?"
"I use this app every day to keep up with my steps and ‚ù§ bpm. It also tells me how stressed I am and O2 levels! It's very easy to use. I especially love the monthly challenges with other users, worldwide. It let's me know what level I'm on as far as my average steps for my age group. Love it!"
Such a large widget with such small letters and numbers. You can't even hit the refresh arrow on the widget without opening the app itself when all I want to do is refresh the step count. Please change it back.
"I spent some time on the phone with tech support, as maps were not available on my cycle rides. They were very patient and solved my problem. I have used this app for a couple years and love it. This was the first time I had any issues. Thch support is fantastic"
I dont like the app anymore since the removal of the calorie intake and weight management function. It was removed two weeks ago and ive only lookes in the app twice after that. Its pretty useless to me now. I was actually going to upgrade my old active to a brand new one but im keeping those 300euros in my pocket now.
"Like the app and how it tracks my steps and time, as well as other health items when I manually enter them. However it doesn't seem to let me measure my stress level any more after I upgraded my phone in August."
For the most part i enjoy using this app for counting steps. BUT the gps tracking for milage in both running and cycling can vary. A mile is a mile it shouldn't have such large distance changes for the same routes I use.
"I just bought a Samsung Galaxy Watch and this app is the perfect companion. The UI is clear, concise and informative. The data syncs quickly and provides good quality feedback on targets etc."
"I like Samsung Health app but I don't understand why Samsung health app needs to access my phone calls, and denies me access to the app when I don't agree to give the access. This is so weird!!! From reading the reviews, Samsung Health doesn't need to access my phone calls, my contacts and other stuff for optimal whatever. Samsung you guys should consider to change the recent update and respect the users opinions!"
"It's a great app for tracking a lot. It does have trouble, when I'm in the car it'll log it as cycling sometimes. Also whilst cycling it'll log it as running or walking, and often only √† fraction of the distance is recorded. It used to be loads better at detecting steps and activity. For my cycling activity I use a Bryton Rider 310. It would be great if I could import the data from the computer (or the Bryton app) to Samsung health."
"Don't like the new update, went for a walk today it did not register all the steps. It was the normal route, only logged half the steps. Also today went for a run and it was all over the place with pace, distance etc. This App has gone from been one of the best to just another fitness app. Really disappointed"
Worked fine until the user agreement changed and demanded access to my phone and contacts. Time for a new fitness app. UPDATE: just got the update for the app. Still asking for phone and contact info and I am still denying it. Poorly thought through. I have moved on to another fitness tracker.
Love the app. Only improvement I'd like to see is to be able to manual add a workout or edit one after the fact. I have a terrible habit of forgetting to start the timer or stop it when I do my workouts.
"Auto detect workouts does not work anymore until I manually enter the app. This is really frustrating, especially when I walk 10 miles and it turns out that my steps are not counted."
This app is awesome and helps keep your motivated. The foot counts need to me more accurate with the Samsung watch active. Anything under 15 steps doesn't register when using the watch. The app works much better with the phone in your pocket instead of relying on the watch.
"So sick of sync issues. So I cant have Google Fit on my gear watch, judt SHealth. SHealth syncs with Noom but only weight?! I had to use a third party app HealthSync to sync my activity from SHealth, to Google Fit which would sync to Noom. And as of 6/30, SHealth won't sync to HealthSync anymore?! This is absurd. If you are going to partner with Noom, do so... all the way. You have the superior app, so maybe stop being proprietary jerks. I'm switching 2 watches and 2 phones to Google."
"Good app with ways to track improvement. Track routes, exercises, food/calories, weight, blood sugar. I really like the monthly step challenges and option to keep up with friends."
"Without Two factor setup, app is not allowing for usage. It should allow after entering password. Two factor authentication will be user choice. Very serious bug. Need to fix asap. I cant sync my fit2 band."
I used this on my S7 and the stress measurement feature which recorded the pulse ox was awesome. On my new S20FE it transferred the info but I'm not able to measure both anymore. Wish I could give 5 stars. Bring that option back & I'll be a happy camper.
"Exercises view is not recording heart rate, heart rate zones etc from Gear S3. Earlier exercises that has been visible but nowadays its not anymore available. Same way S3 relate app is not anymore give option to start exercise directly from watch UI. Something wrong or features removed by Samsung?"
Have used the app for several months. It seemed to have a glitch that prevented accurate calorie counting. I have updated the app and is now back to normal. I find it easy to use and fairly accurate.
"Again the sync issue is seen. My step count, water intake are not synced completely with my Samsung Gear Fit 2 Pro. Issue is seen since yesterday after Samsung Wearable update on Android. Last month also, I had this problem which was solved after another update."
"I was using this for motivation on my phone, you know to keep me consistent on my workouts, and it works. Helps me thrive to get my steps in, I got myself a fit bit to help out and it synchronizes real good to this app. I even got my husband into it, he even asked me to order him a fit bit so he can keep track of his activity and heart rate and all that using this app. Since using I lost 30 lbs!! Yup, it does help to keep track of what workouts you do and when you do them, even the heart rate."
The app works very well and helps to track activities without any hassle. The only issue is it does not synchronize with the Discovery App even though the settings have been reset and permission is allowed.
"Love it! Easy to keep track, the workouts are fun, and the design is appealing and easy to use. My one criticism is that there should be a way to suggest new categories for tracking specific workouts."
"This would have been 5 stars, did the upgrade yesterday and my weight management has totally disappeared, this was the most important feature for me. Also global and friend challenges, unless I now gave my phone number I cant continue to take part, why is my phone no required? Very disappointed after using this app for the last 7 weeks has been a life saver for me. Also thanks, I just bought a Galaxy fit to use with the app..wasted money."
"Unreliable bluetooth. (phone is Galaxy S10) Works for a bit, then doesn't connect. Tried uninstalling everything and reinstalling. Keeps repeating the installation without connecting. Girlfriend's Galaxy S9 phone and Fit2 Pro never connected at all. Junk."
While doing regular activity it does not record. MY google fit shows different data and it shows different. I am doing activity for 60 minutes. It records 35 minutes. Skips data for 25minutes. Pathetic least to say. Or it might be that it supports only samsung phone.
"The app has become extremely inaccurate...it says I have been running when I was walking and the like. The mileage is off, and now that I would like to download my data and try to reinstall it, I can't do it because it doesn't recognize my password."
Not able to save workout info.  I Don't hold the phone while on the treadmill. So would like to input treadmill info. But the app will not save. I push the save button but it doesnt work.
"I had a five-star review, but now I'm giving one star. Due to the fact it never works right. And it's so so so so slow oh! Constantly freezes on me since an update, now I cannot get it to work at all. I even uninstalled and reinstalled it. It's awful now. LG Q7 plus is the phone I have ..."
"Great until this last update! I had excellent luck with tracking my workouts and activity levels amazingly until whatever update pushed this weekend. Now my 1 hour workout is logged in 5 sessions over 12 minutes because I kept having to restart it. It kept stopping tracking, though it tracked my heart rate to 152bpm. Is there a way to manually enter my workouts since the Active 2 has stopped?"
"The step count history in the latest version of the app is out of sync. The 12 month stats relate to the period Dec 2015 to Nov 2016 and if you click back onto the 7 days and 31 days tabs from there, they show stats for equivalent time periods in 2020!"
Used on both my old Galaxy phones. The S5 & S10+ and was pretty good keeping track of steps. Sleep time and calorie tracking a little more intensive and requires extra time I sometimes don't have. Also signed up for some exercise classes until old phone broke
"Gave in and enabled two-factor authentication. The first two-factor authentication code did not work. Tried it again. It worked inexplicably. Entered my password, and now I get a 403 error. ""Sorry, the resource you want to access is forbidden."" This is a really bad user experience every step of the way."
"I'm disappointed that the new update removed the leaderboard graph with for all users' step data. For people like me who don't have many friends on Samsung Health, it was a motivation to get more active to see where I ranked with all users and my age group. Please bring it back in the next update."
Since last update cant get past the crazy 2 step verification loop. Was fine before. Always updates screw things up. Can't get it setup. It goes back and forth from set it up to can't set it up. Very frustrating!
Good - needs a feature added. It would be a great add to the app if you could scan the barcode on food items. This would allow immediate and exact input if food / calories / carbs / etc. Please add this feature.
"The latest update removed the sP02 measurement ability. Was this intentional? Update after your response: The 02 tracker has been removed from the list of manageable items. As well, a notice in the app dated May 30th states that Sat monitoring will be removed. This is a mistake in a fitness app, especially for us asthmatics. Please update the app to include oxygenation monitoring. 2nd update after your response: my app doesn't have the stress function. And what does stress have to do with Sp02??"
"I love this app so much!I have been using it for several years. In the past 2 years I've lost 70 lbs using the challenges, and programs that I manage like steps tracking, Calories intake and monitoring my weight. I highly recommend it"
"Interfaces nicely with my Galaxy Watch and My Fitness Pal data. With my GW heart monitoring set to Always, I can also monitor sleep, including REM. Nice control over turning on or off a large variety of notifications regarding areas it can monitor, like activity. Very nice."
"I can't even log in to my app after the last update. This is awful... It keeps asking for 2 step verification. After putting in the codes, it doesn't log in from there. It's quite frustrating at the moment."
"i love this app but since the last update i have had nothing but problems. it crashes, it wont update my steps, it wont connect to my Samsung watch which it should have no issue. i had to just delete the widget bc it was annoying me from just saying updating for the last 48 hours. i really hope they fix this update. before this update it worked great"
"Excellent, but can add more features. Recently I have been noticing a bug, the app is recording swimming automatically from my watch, I have also workout trainer installed on my device."
The App has many good features but doesn't always detect my activity correctly. The nutritional info tracking part doesn't show daily consumed sugar so I need an extra app on my phone just for that. Hope the devs add it at some point as they promised to 4 years ago.
I use this app everyday and have it synced to my watch. I need the weight management system back! I used that the most. It really helped with weight control and calorie intake.
The last thing that I expected to see in an app that CHILDREN can use is a picture of a naked couple having sex in a bathtub linking an article about someone having sex with her boyfriend. You should clean up your 'related content' section. The only reason I even use this app is because I can't link my Samsung Active 2 directly to MyFitnessPal - this app doesn't sync well at all with MyFitnessPal. I will be switching back to a Fitbit with my next watch. You don't even have a viable email link.
"I use it to track my gym workouts, daily steps, and heart rate. Works great with my Active S2 watch. Just wish there was a way to go over the information through a desktop web interface instead of my phone. Granted, I have a S20 Ultra but it would just be better on a desktop."
I really wish you would add a food barcode scanner to make it more simple to use. Most of the other health apps have it. It would simplify adding each ingredient for a meal cooked at home. Thanks
"I've used this app for almost a year. I like it records my sleep, steps, heart rate and stress. Why doesn't it monitor stress levels continuously like it used to? If it will only monitor stress when you ask it to instead."
"Bought a 300‚Ç¨ watch and the app is not starting with my samsung account. I Had to search the web for a ""solution"" This is extremely annoying. In addition the watch was advertise to have functions which I am not able to use (ECG for example) and were the main reason behind buying the watch. Thank you Samsung for tricking my on buying a useless product."
Not able to login in my LG G8s . I would like to see how will work app before buying Galaxy Active 2 watch. Solution: download old version vkp and skip login at first step and login to account via setup section. After you can update app on Google play. Reason of issue is new version of app which is required login at begging. But Samsung team did bad job regards to non Samsung phones.
"The latest update took away the last feature I used to use everyday : weight trend. It already took away weight and calorie management at previous update, and now this. So dissapointed. May consider to change my wearable too if it keeps downgrading its app feature."
"Unable to login after formatting the phone each time i try login in ""something went wrong with the server. Try again later"" Tried uninstall and reinstall the app. Let me know if you want me to try something different. Phone used OnePlus 6 along with samsung gear fit 2 pro. Worked absolutely fine before teh formatting."
Review changed after some help from the Samsung team. I woke up today and had lost all my steps from the previous day!! But was quickly resolved and they where showing as being back on a few hours later.
"Lost one of the best features, O2 Saturation. With a respiratory illness this was an important selling point for me choosing my phone. Americans in the US have a ""Stress"" module but the rest of us are out of luck. The only option is to find and install and older package and prevent updates."
"What the hell happened, Floor count is just gone? Trends is now a bunch more clicks, what happened to intuitive and ease of use, as it was before the latest update. Please put the old interface back."
"Two step verification is horriblw. I have tried for 2 days to sign in and it will not let me. I sign in with email just fine. Then I do it with my cell, it sends me a text with a code, the code does not work. It will not even let me click the verify button. The code is not inputted wrong. I tried to email with an issue and it will not let me send that either"
"This application while it works well, but I found it to be extremely annoying, because it interferes with FreeStyle Libre Glucose sensor in the blood. It more often than not (Samsung Health App) wants to be your default app, causing an error of reading. This is true No matter how many times you tell it that you want to use your Diabetes blood glucose app. I finally had to Uninstall the Samsung Health app from my 2 Samsung cellphones"
"After the last update, the app takes forever to sync with my Fit bracelet and crashes often. Otherwise, a good app - I just wish the developers released updates that fix bugs instead of introducing new ones."
First they removed weight management which was helpful to get an idea if I was on track calorie wise at a glance. Now they demand access to areas of my phone a health app has no need for such as calls and contacts. I just record my calorie intake. What was a stellar app is now a waste of time.
"Hi SH Team, Just wanted to say after last update the App is no longer showing the average weight. Previously if the weight is added 2 to 3 times in a single day the App used to show the average, but now it only shows the last added data. Kindly fix this issue thanks. Also add more desi Asian food options thanks."
I just started using this app again since I received my new S10+. But it is not registering the correct amount of daily steps or active minutes. My Fitbit versa shows my step count at over 4000 steps and Samsung Health only shows just over 400. Definitely a discrepancy there.
Shouldn't need phone permissions. I don't really care for the canned response about providing a better experience but not actually needing to make phone calls. If you don't need to make phone calls then don't ask for phone permissions. I also don't get why this app needs two step verification. All I wanted to do was to see my step count over time. Doesn't seem like a big ask which needs an account with two step verification.
"I like this App very much but after update There is a bug in your current update. Issue is after accepting the app initial permissions it doesn't do anything instead an Error is shown on the screen. Kindly resolve this Issue. will give better rating then. The Error is as below ""Can't open app For your security, Samsung Health can't be opened on a rooted phone.(0xEx7#0010null61N2530)"" I have checked my phone it is not rooted because I bought a brand new box pack phone Samsung Galaxy Note FE."
"I this app everyday on my Samsung. I use Wifi to access. However, today I couldn't load ""Discovery"" and everything related to Programs and Mindful sections which requires the Internet. I could access via my 3G. It was strange. Please get it checked. UPDATED: It works normally again. Thank you."
"I use this app daily and I like it a lot. Despite loving the global challenges and age group comparisons, I think you are losing space to fitness apps and could be very relevant add popular wearables like the Mi Band 4 in the accessories, as well finally include a night mode."
"After 24 hrs recording missed due to an update issue, recommending me to take a walk at 2:11am probably isn't the best idea. Perhaps, debug your program, then suggest how I should be exercising at appropriate times. Say, closer to my statistically active times, perhaps..."
"It was a good app until lately, where its time and pace when doing runs are compelety different and wrong compared to other tech. I also didn't enjoy many of the things they took off such as the weight scale and how much I should be eating and how much calories I should be eating"
"Great app however my biggest downfall is the step count completion. There's no way people can walk more than 200,000 steps in less than a week. It kinda takes the fun away of giving myself a real idea of my placement üò≠. Otherwise love it"
Was great but after the update it is incredibly inaccurate. I just did a chipped race and the my watch did not have the right distance and the pace tracking was off by around 2 minutes per mile. Very disappointing.
I have been using this app for years and love it. I always do the walking challenge as soon as i saw that the March map was available to join I did and was told that it was full and to be quicker joining next month when its only just become available to join not a clue whats going on need an explanation not happy at all!
"Well, what a terrible app, Got a new phone and try to log in. But it's just keeps stuck in de loading screen. It's been there for over an hour now. Maybe try and make an app that works before you push the update! I did have problems with my previous phone."
"I cannot use it on my one plus 7. Once I punch in my login credentials it goes for an infinite spin Update: The solution provided by Samsung didn't solve my problem. However, I was able to solve the problem in the following way: 1. Downloaded APK of Samsung health version 6.8.5 2. Opened the app by skipping login 3. Logged into the app from menu option using my Samsung credentials 4. Once I made sure the app was working, upgraded the app from play store"
"Crashes constantly, especially during the stress measurement process. Reinstall worked, once.... That's it.... Only way to make oxygen saturation module work is to reinstall. Called phone number, was in hold for 17 minutes and like dropped."
"just bought the samsung galaxy watch to replace my Fitbit, sadly I should have looked more into the reviews before doing so as I didn't realize that Samsung health had such a bad accuracy rate for steps and well recording flights of stairs is non existent. for tracking such things, Fitbit is much better sadly."
I am so happy I downloaded this app. I love the language of it. The way it cares and asks how was our week and the motivation it provides to keep us updated on reaching or crossing our targets. The ux design is simple and shows that the app cares for you which further motivates you to use it.
Getting rid of the weight management feature means I will no longer be using this app. I used to use the app daily to track my calorie deficit but can no longer do so. The app is pointless now and im off to look for a replacement one.
"Terrible, this app updated by itself when clearly I have auto updates turned off. I cannot do required login it states I am already logged in. After that screen, you cannot use the app! I defaulted back to factory version the other day, but I am sure it will update this app again w/o my permission. Sad, the play store ignores your request to not update an app. What is going on? This app used to work quite well w/o a mandatory login? And why must a health app need to access my contacts?"
I've been using this app for years. I've given it 5 stars previously but the new update is asking for permission make calls! It is creepy and invasive. is no reason for that. It is time to get rid of Samsung Health. Luckily there are many similar apps that don't require invasive permissions.
"I connected Samsung Health with my Gear Fit and it's so awesome! My phone is Galaxy M30 and it doesn't support heart-rate or Oxygen sensor but it's not a really big problems! Also the app can record sleeping time pretty accurately, which I love the most about it! Even iPhone Health app doesn't have these cool features like this!"
I use this app together with my galaxy active watch. But now you cannot count your steps separately! Like how dumb is that! I tried pausing the steps from my phone but it paused my watch steps too! Please change it back because this is really disappointing. Going to use a different app in the mean time
Very intuitive app and very informative. I'm 50 and keep a certain level of activity level to stay healthy and this works. It also seamlessly integrates with my Samsung Frontier Smartwatch and records everything.
"I like the app so far but two small things would make it tons better. 1. Allow user to add the serving UofM (grams, cups, etc) to ""My Foods"". (See Carb Manager for how to do this well. I am not using it currently only because I hoped to need only one app). 2. Allow a few options for adding water consumption, such as 16 oz, 20 oz bottle or the ability to manually enter values. The point of both suggestions is to lessen the need for manual calculations to log actual consumption. Many thanks"
"I was not given the opportunity to keep the old settings, the app just changed. I don't have a galaxy 3 watch and I probably wouldn't buy one, changing the app to suit the new watch is irresponsible. I have deleted the app from my phone and I will find something else."
This app the Samsung health is losing steps. Every morning I lose 5 to 10 thousand steps from the day before. I have contacted Samsung health app for help and no one can figure this out... Please I need someone to help me. I've been using this app for three years never had an issue until the last 4 weeks.
"2 step verification should be OPTIONAL. I use this app to track my steps and walking distance, nothing more. I don't care if someone breaks into my health app and sees my steps. I refuse to give permission to my phone and contacts, so apparently I can't use this app any more. Really disappointing and annoying!"
Previously I rated this App 5 star but now I have changed it to 3 star because of removal of one of the most useful feature 'Weight Management'. Keeping track of calories intake and burn really helped in losing weight. Please bring this feature back!
"Prior to January 13, 2021 this app was phenomenal. Literally overnight the app changed. I no longer see the total carbs per day as I go. Now I have to try to add my damn carb numbers per meal and figure out how much I have left. Sadly I will not be using this app until this is fixed."
I used to like this app but no longer. It no longer counts steps or recognize active time. I have cleared the app's cache and data. Still doesn't work. Lots of bugs showing up lately.
"The Aug. 2020 update removed the calorie counter to help manage weight. This is a big issue for me as that's one of the biggest reasons I preferred this app over others. Please give that back to us. Minor note, the new color scheme makes it difficult to see the ""Nutrition Intake Summary"" percentages."
"Doesn't count steps correctly on my honor 10. I checked permissions, battery settings, background apps...Samsung health gives 700 steps when both Google Fit and Huawei health count over 4000. Thank you for your reply.(pause/start/purge cache...) Unfortunately it still doesn't work. I uninstalled/reinstalled, paused...It counts some steps but far from the real figures."
"For several years I have entered my weight daily, watching the graph of weekly and monthly averages for trends. It seems this ability to follow averages for trends has been dropped from the app. This is disappointing."
I believe the step count is fairly accurate. It tracks a lot of different things! I love the monthly step challenges. This app keeps me motivated to stay active and to live a healthy lifestyle!
"Fantastic! Even better with the Galaxy Watch 4! The only thing it's missing is the ability to group the workouts together (Leg workouts, chest workouts etc) then maybe setting up and plan with said workouts for certain days! Those adds would get me to use the workout section waaaaaaay more!"
I really benefitted with the weight control section . It's the only place where you can easily gage your calories used minus cal consumed at any given time of the day. Definitely put it back - please!
"I had the app on my S9 plus and it was amazing, I was able to always measure my oxygen saturation level, as well as my heart rate. Now the app is useless and does not preform any of these functions. It's worthless."
"This app works fine, and it seems to connect to my smart watch without any issues. However, I mostly use it to take my pulse directly from my phone. Pulse is not too reliable when recorded by the watch."
"I like everything but I'm having issues with it tracking my distance. Today I jogged over 5 miles and it only recorded 3 miles for the whole day... Also, for the food section it doesn't seem to adjust to calories that have been burned al day. Luckily I'm using third party apps that I track my health with or I would be even more fustrated."
"Would be nice to be able to review the data on a PC. Why is this not a feature? The app compiles a large amount of data which you are then limited to review on a tiny watch face or, at best, a phone. Ridiculous!"
I've used Samsung since they released galaxy s2. In the last year Samsung have made many annoying changes to their apps regarding permissions and notifications. I'm getting more and more fed up by having to find workarounds to their intrusive mess..
"Weight management has disappeared on latest update. This app used to be 5 stars, can only give it a 2 star now. Please put weight management back on it. Update 11 August. Thanks for responding. I've been using this app to record all my health/fitness stats for 2 years. Please get weight mgmt back. It's a pain having to use another app aswell. Updated review 24 July 2021. New phone and so Updated app. Now when tracking a run I have to choose a pace setter. I don't want to. TIME TO BIN THIS APP."
Version 6.20.0.039 didn't record my walk. It showed detecting but no recording. How do I make it record? If I can't make it work I will try to go to the previous one That is why I only gave 2 stars My problem about not recording is my operator trouble. I explored more and found out my problem. Thanks for the reply Samsung Electronics
"I love the app in general and how it helps count my calories. However, it's starting to freeze up and I am scared that my steps won't be recorded accurately. O can walk and listen to my favorit youtube video."
"With the latest update to remove the weight management without notice or anything and that was one of the best things of that app, why take it out. It helped it stand out from Apple that has nothing, and from an engineer saying this more is always better until it breaks the item you are making."
"Recently my App is not recording all steps and distance. It sporadically under records steps and distance. Prior to this, it worked reasonably well. I have an A20 smartphone. This App is now unreliable for accurate recording."
"I have been using it hand in hand with my Galaxy watch 4 on my one plus 9, great integration, no bugs, records amazingly well. Great product, great plugins. Extreme ease of access set up and go."
"Well it definitely appears Samsung is being tone deaf. Similar to most if the recent comments; I have used this app for years. After the last update, Samsung now wants a plethora of permmissions before I can use the app. Well that ain't going to happen. Why the app all of a sudden now needs thise permissions beats me. So out goes this app until Samsung fixes the issue not worth it."
"I use it every day to track my steps a d workouts. I could use more of the functions, but I don't want to. I like the monthly challenge. I think that Samsung has tried to eliminate the bots."
overall great app. wish it had a barcode scanner for the calorie counter to make it easier to search foods and the display of calories allowed and burned on the weight managment is a little weird but again overall great app and use it everyday.
It adds 900 calories by default. Without even wearing the samsung band. It's just pushing false data. Clearing cache is not the solution. Didn't expect this from samsung. Extremely Disappointed. You need fix this.
"Have been using this app for over a year. I do the monthly challenge every month. I was very disappointed to find out that I could not join next month because it was ""full"". And this was a whole week before the new month. Probably not going to use the app if I can't do the monthly challenge."
"I lovw how easy it is to use the software. It allows you to customize it for weight loss, fitness tracker, health tracker, and so much more all in one. I don't expect to use anything else any time soon."
"I had this APP for years and was extremely happy with it, but recently had to disagree and uninstall it due to its FORCED request to ""Make"" and ""Manage"" phone calls in order to continue using it. Why would this app need permissions to make and manage phone calls from MY phone?? Creepy!!"
"The latest update forces you to create a Samsung account. I have zero interest in sharing my data with Samsung. The app worked fine without having an account. This is my second Samsung phone, I have never signed up for a Samsung account. I removed the updated app from my phone and enabled Google Fit."
"I updated the app on 9 October and since then don't receive notifications (reminders) about sleep. The ""sleep"" notification is turned on in the settings. Update: thanks for reply, is there a way to contact you without paying enormous fees for a transcontinental call?"
Auto resume does not work and sometimes failed to start. It is pretty buggy. This app use to work well until the past month. I have uninstalled and reinstalled several times. My phone is Note 20 Ultra 512GB.
"Trouble with setup. Account keeps requesting I set up 2-factor authentication, even when I go through the steps to set up. Can't seem to get out of the loop and actually use the app."
"keeps pausing during walks and jogs. does not track distance correctly probably due to autopause workout. update. if i force display to stay on and run waze in background, appears auto pause does not happen but battery drains."
"I love my Samsung Health app, it's a great way to monitor my health. With it, I can check my eating, drinking, heart rate, and much more. I've been able to gain the muscle I was looking for thanks to thus apps ability to tell you what exactly I'm putting in my body, regarding nutrients and calories."
"Lousy app. Cant even open the app at all and error message keeps on pop out. When send email to the customer service, asking for so much info and not willing to resolve the issue. Disappointed with such bad experience."
We loved this app. Used it every day however recently when you go I to your workouts it keeps crashing. And we don't want to clear all our data as we use it for comparisons. Any help would be great.
"Good app, but can improve by adding some more excersise tracking features. It would be good to add visibility for Blood Pressure readings in Samsung Health, (similarly to ECG) instead of having to check the Health Monitor app. Thanks. PS, please consider allowing Samsung Health Monitor to be available for all devices, for a quick installation, not just for Samsung."
I don't use it as much since they moved the oxygen feature to a dual measurement. It helped being able to see where my breathing was on the scale now as long as my pulse is fine it shows I'm fine.
FLOOR COUNT not working. it always say 0/10 in my galaxy note 9. even when I goup from geound floor to 5th floor at a time. pls fix it. and I request you to add ALTIMETER to calculate height after a certain range so that we understand when we liftup. Walking and running graf should be in different color. pls bringback WEIGHT MANAGEMENT in next update.
"This is a piece of garbage. Some time ago I uninstalled it because it drained my battery heavily. Now I gave it another chance, I couldn't even login using the same phone! There are nice graphs but no web interface where you could get your exact sleep info or anything. I'm close to sell my Galaxy watch due to this freakin app"
"For the last month or so, the Samsung Health widget sits in updating mode for ages when I turn my phone on and sometimes continually until I actually have to go into the app. Is this a bug? and can you fix it please. Everything was working fine before."
"Intrusive, useless need for contact information. Why does the app even need permissions for contacts just to LOG IN?  Although response from developers are appreciated, the useless ""permissions are granted for specific app features"" and ""your data is protected"" are meaningless.  WHAT feature requires my contact details? So what if you are ""protecting"" my data? All it needs is a data breach and my details are leaked."
"Samsung Galaxy S3 is a fairly accurate step counter, however when Samsung Health syncs with S3 the step count is grossly inaccurate. The count is 10X in error after syncing even when the phone is left on a desk when cycling. This is apparently an error in the Health App.."
I have had this app 4 days and has undercounted my steps and active time 3 days. By 4 or 5 thousand steps and it's happened lots of times when downloaded in the past. Will be uninstalling again as it's pointless.i have subsequently downloaded 3 months in a row with same results and uninstalled because of the same issue. I want a step counter that counts steps
I have been using this app in conjunction with my Samsung Gear Pro for a couple of years. All of a sudden it's telling me there are no wearable devices connected. It doesn't register my sleep patterns such are very important to me. I have tried everything and nothing works. Can you help?
When I first used this app it really helped me keep track of my health and activities. I noticed with every update since it lost more and more features. Now it seems virtually useless. Hey developers bring back healthy pace and maybe I will reinstall.
"I hate the food log. you can't find anything on it, to keep track of the calories. Wheres the scan for the bar code. take a look, at MyFitnessPal. That one has a lot more options."
"Latest update requires too many permissions. I don't want to share Phone numbers or phone identity, even if it is only ""for optimal user experience"". Asking these permissions is not a good user experience."
"I have had to disconnect, and uninstall the app multiple times to fix the app. It randomly will stop syncing with my watch. Now after trying both, it's no longer syncing with my galaxy watch."
Very nice and interactive app. It makes us active by providing challenges and giving targets. Altogether fun app but some UI could be made more easier like showing Water intake directly on our device notification panel could make its track more easier.
Random workout logs are being sent to my galaxy watch for future workout dates. Currently it's showing workouts up to July. I like to keep track of my runs and exercises but there are multiple logs of things I actually did and the future date workouts that I can't delete. Please help with a solution.
I think this app is a very handy way to keep track over your general fitness. It can help to balance you active lifestyle with healthy eating. There are a few minor changes with updates one thatbaffles me is calories burnt which I feel could do with an explanation.
I can't get it to run in the background unless I have the app open at all times. Sometimes it will randomly close. Sometimes it randomly appears but disappears if I open them close the app. I love this app but it is frustrating.
"Only use to track my food, water, sleep and weight. The food section needs and update to match current food label nutrition that has been updated for years now. The sleep doesn't notice I'm awake even though I got up and laid back down and using my phone. Also a little difficult to edit sleep."
"Less intuitive after the update, and I miss the walking challenges. I also wish I could track what time each cup of water is input, because I can never remember."
"Samsung Health has helped me to safely loose the excess weight that I've been trying to loose. By helping track my steps, my calories, and my sleep (amongst other health aspects) Samsung Health helps me see real #s & real reasons behind my weight & health fluctuations. Thusly, allowing me to analyze & compose a realistic plan of action, for getting my best results, without requiring too much time investment. I'm super busy constantly. The app's ease of use, allows me to continue using the app"
"Good application but less report variances such as showing all steps in a week/month and breakdown by day and count the total and average. In addition in Steps, I can't export like as Heart section do. And also please add drink water reminder and can send alert to my watch."
"Since the last update, one of the main reasons I use this app has disappeared. I can no longer see my average blood glucose levels for the week, month, or over a period of several months. It seems I can only see the average per day. So now, I am off to search for another app for this purpose. I really wish if something isn't broken they wouldn't change it."
Works when it wants too. Hasnt worked for over a week now. I've tried looking up everything and done everything it has suggested... still wont count my steps. Works fine if I put it on a walking work out but I dont want that running on my phone all day. Fed up now.
"O2 sensor missing, now just an average app. I used the O2 sensor everyday because of sleep apnea and a heart condition. Very disappointed the app no longer tracks it and the result is only available temporarily as part of the stress reading. Very poor development decision by Samsung."
Won't install properly. Get to the sign in and the app sits there with the spinning icon. Tried a few times to reinstall after a phone restart with same results. I'm trying to use it on a OnePlus 7T Pro with latest Android OS. Really not impressed.
"Loved the app at first but now it wants access to manage and make phone calls and won't work without that access apparently. No explanation as to why it HAS to have this access to work, if it's just a new feature then just let me turn that feature off."
"I wish it would sync with more external sites and apps for tracking. The sleep tracker, when I click on the notification, doesn't open. I have to go open the app and find the sleep to input the hours."
"Xiaomi Mi Fit - Google Fit - Health Sync - Samsung Health. Those are the four apps you have to use to connect a non-Samsung fitness tracker (in my case it's Xiaomi Mi Smart Band 4) to Samsung Health! Why, Samsung, WHY?!üò´üòµ If I could just seamlessly connect to the app, I'd definitely use it, because it has loads of valuable features and a great UI. Bummer! üòî Shame on those developers / corporate policy..."
"Very in depth and useful! Allows you to track food intake, heart rate, exercise routines etc...very complete for a free app. Only drawback for people that like a challenge is that when you do the monthly challenges under ""Together"" section, you can clearly see that some individuals cheat their way through their steps. Wishing Samsung would cut those accounts off as taking 235000 steps in one day is clearly not accurate while some of us actually do these challenges to see how we compare."
"This is a nice app for tracking urself when u want to lose weight. It is also useful for meditation and teenagers!! They have built in exercise tutorial video insideüòÜüëç But I just want to have a secret glow up so pls dont ask for my contact....Dont tell my friend plsüòÄ PLS i just want something ""PRIVACY"" not so dissappinted but need improvementsüí™"
"Decent app. Liked it better before the newest update. The reason I'm not giving a higher score: -Not able to import weight from Helth Mate (got a nokia smart weight). -Stress tracking seems to be missing. -Can't customize wich element should be in focus, like expanding sleep tracking on the dashboard."
Trending broken. The latest update broke the trending feature. You can no longer select the time scale for looking at the data. This was the single reason I was using the app and now it's completely useless.
Was best app untill Samsung decided to kill the Oxygen Saturation measurements and added it to cumbersome stress measurements doesn't even show properly and export option is also not that straightforward to quickly see. Only workaround i found was to uninstall and install apk from old version and not let it update.
"Leaderboards are a joke. Calculated what top 10 people would have to do to get claimed score. If they walked 18 hrs/day, they would have to take between 2 and 3 steps per SECOND, non-stop. Other than that and how slow it is getting info from the watch, a great app."
"After the latest update, I can't sync thus app with my other apps. This was possible before the update. Getting frustrated over d loss of data due to the inability to sync with other apps."
I used to use this app for a while to track salt intake and it was amazing. I've recently installed it again and it won't even log in. I've put in my credentials many times and the app just spins and spins for minutes. I gave up on it and chose another fitness app.
"Had to delete. Loved this app now with all the permissions its asking, it was easier to just delete. You dont need to have permission to my contacts, phone calls, etc just to work. Ridiculous how they are trying to get all your information to layer sell it for ads"
This app has gone downhill rapidly with recent updates removing the ability to review trends over variable periods (days/weeks/months). The inability to easily review trend data renders this app fatally flawed as trends are much more important than one off measurements. Don't understand who could have imagined it was a good idea to remove this functionality.
"After the most recent update I cannot look at my challenges without syncing my contact list on my phone??? VERY DISSAPOINTED Edit: after their response, I put it to one star and emailed them. THERE IS NO REASON TO NEED ACCESS TO MY CONTACT LIST FOR ME TO PARTICIPATE IN CHALLENGES."
"Samsung Galaxy Note 3: After I updated my firmware & app the step counter stopped working. I have tried all of the methods for fixing the step counter. When the counter was working it inspired me to exercise more. Now, regardless of how active I am see my activity all was at zero is discouraging!!!"
"Has some decent options but by taking the heart rate sensor off of the Note 20 ultra it's become even less useful. Kind of a rip off for people buying the nicest phone they offer. The latest update has taken my previous score of a two to a one now. This update changed everything that was good about this apps food log. It's not user friendly at all. I liked how it was before, please revert back to the previous version."
"Limited food choice. You cant submit your own food to their list. When creating your own food list you have no ability to add weight of the food only calories. To developers: ""I can measure the weight of the food that i eat, i cant measure calories"". This app logic is counterintuitive... When you creat ""My Food"" item it does not synch with your profile. If you change your phone and login ""my food"" is blank"
This app looks absolutely gorgeous! The drop shadow on all those customisable tiles is making the app looks beautiful. It also supports tonnes of activities recording and allows you to share your progress with your friends (optional). Nice job!
"Not only does it not sync with fitbit the Samsung community has been disabled too, I bought an app to over ride and sync with Samsung health / fitbit and then the step count got disabled too My 3* review has gone down to 1* as the updates do not seem to be for the better anymore also challenges etc limited compared to other companies üòï"
I loved this app but it stopped tracking my fitness at midnight on 31st December 2019! Previously very happy. Now very unhappy. Forums suggested clearing cache - didn't make it start . deleting and reinstalling. I did that but still not working plus lost all my history data üò´üò´üò´
"Data hog. I disabled use of background data but this app still used 0.5 GB somehow. Also, this app uses a lot of my battery. Even with a fresh device reset, it drains my battery 3x normal. Uninstall and immediately fixed. Poorly written or continually transferring data, I don't know."
Why do you suddenly need my phone number and permission to make and manage phone calls to access the Challenges!? Goodbye samsung health.... Shame I can't respond to your reply ... you don't need permission to 'make or manage' phone calls to implement features. I've had the app years and you've never needed it before only since the last update! Now uninstalled..
"Clear dashboard about steps, active minutes, sleep etcetera. Other options/history can be a little hard to find sometimes. All in all a good step counter with interesting extras."
"My bloody phone is full and I have to choose between apps to keep updated. Meanwhile this useless app consumes space and can't be removed. Samsung, I hate you! And don't bother telling me to just get a new phone. Some of us live on budgets."
"I started using this app and really liked it at first. I then bought a Garmin watch only to find out it doesn't work with this app. this was extremely disappointing and now I no longer use this app as there is no point using two different platforms. Update 08/04/20, this app still does not have the functionality to link fitness devices such as Garmin vivo. Such a shame as still like the app just not it's connections."
I can't even log into this app. I bought a new band and it's app doesn't let me log in.(the loading animation keeps playing forever after trying to sign in) And I can't use the app without logging in. What a brilliant first impression.
Update - SAMSUNG HAVE NOT FIXED THE ISSUES JUST MADE THEM WORSE! thought updates were supposed to improve the app? Since the update I have lost the weight managment section completely. I enjoyed being able to see whether I was over or under my calorie intake. Will have to find a new app now that will sync with my watch. Also unhappy that samsung only ever reply with 'call this number' Having already stated my issue there seems little point in me phoning an out of country number to reiterate it!
This app never start automatically after the mobile wake up from locked screen. It should be automatically detect the step. Most of app in market performance like that we no need to launch app every time. If implement this features in this app it would been great and I will give 5 star.
I am still getting an error after an update so I can't get in to the app. I notice I'm not the only one. Your remedy was to send an email to a noreply address or call you internationally. That is not professional. Very disappointed . Please send a link to a help page so I can sort this out.
"(edited review after working with customer service and completely resetting watch *not the problem) I did not even know it was possible to be this frustrated with a health app 100% dissatisfied w/ the Samsung health app with which is Sad bc I love my Galaxy watch and note 9 But for a fitness tracker I wish I would have stuck with the fit bit- no Pandora, does not have half the features that the fit bit app offers, Step count, floors, calories burned and heart rate are all inaccurate."
"Updated UI is just bad. I used to be able to easily log and view information, but the new UI is unintuitive and requires more clicks to access any information."
"I am using Samsung watch 4 classic, the issue i am having is the steps are not sync with the google fit. How difficult it could be when Samsung use google platform still unable to sync properly. Google fit is used to sync steps across other platforms. Why Samsung has make it so difficult? Posted on 1Jan22 on Galaxy Store, no response from tech support. Also on other comments no response on Galaxy Store. Their own platform no response üòï."
Difficult to use. Exercise activity pauses without input. Some settings cannot be used. Sleep settings difficult to edit. Food data must be input manually. This app is unreliable and unresponsive.
I have enjoyed using this app more than any other fitness app I have used in the past. I love the fact that I can have fitness challenges either with my friends or the monthly global Samsung community challenges. It has really motivated me to keep fit and watch my nutrition and general health status. So grateful to my 19yr old son who gifted me a brand new Samsung Galaxy Smartwatch which got me on the Samsung health app.
"An app I've found perfect and incredibly useful in the past, won't even open after the latest update. It requires ""acceptance of privacy policy"" but an error occurs every time I click ""continue."
good basic app for sports. I use it mostly for tracking steps and flights of stairs. tried today to track on a stationary bike. the audio guidance telling you how long you've gone is horrible. not exactly motivating...
"I'm going to echo the other complaints you're seeing - the weight management feature was my main reason for the download and it's gone. There are other good features, but without that option it's not worth the space."
"Awesome app, but can you look into the exercise summary detail. The text is now very small....so sight impaired people can't read the data. Specific to heart rate, speed etc."
I'm not sure what changed on this app but it appears that it is not recording the mileage or the calories pauses randomly. it also doesn't show the track of where I am walking like it used to.
"Used to be a great app, but now Samsung are placing un-removable ads here as with all their other apps, I am not only giving this a low review but I will also be switching to another hardware platform. Dont want to pay a grand for a phone only to be bombarded with ads. Samsung you have lost a customer!"
"Has been good but since the update, I have to allow it to have access to my calls and contacts, and because I have chosen no, the app will not open. Stuff you. It is there for heath, not contacts and calls. Big thumbs down."
"I would give 5 Stars if some issues are resolved 1. App is always running in Background even if I paused the Steps and disabled auto detection of workouts (For Battery Saving Habit) 2. Even very simple Indian Food are not available to add in Food eg. Dahi, Poha, Khichadi (Have to add manually) 3. Sometimes Cycling is showing correct workout time but less Distance. PS: Workout marked on Map can be improved."
"Tried to set up 2 step verification, press verfiy and it takes me back to the 1st step to start verification. Yes I cleared cache and data. Uninstalled and re-installed. No way to log into app. Even if I wanted tk use the app and followed the steps it just goes back to square one. Fix this."
"One request: for an exercise like push up, let us enter the numbers instead of workout duration. I would like to keep track of something like 3 sets of 10 push ups instead of 3 sets of 10 minute push ups. Using minutes here just doesn't make sense at all."
Downloaded app to go with my new galaxy active 2 watch unable to sign in tried all hacks doesn't work. There's a great reason why I stopped using Samsung products a few years back. The watch will be going back as well I suppose as if I cannot use the features of it it's not worth the money
"This new update is horrible. It has taken the best out of the app. Previously it use to show running and walking together in a circle for each day, auto detect by phone. Now it's gone. Not useful. Any idea how to revert to previous version?"
"I love the device personally and having all my info in one place, but miss the connectivity with my fitbit friends. I loved doing challenges with friends, but all those folks are fitbit and not changing to samsung anytime soon."
"I use this app all the time. I'm not a fan of the most recent update which means to record a meal I have to select record, select which meal and then say done. Why the extra click? It's annoying and unnecessary."
"Good app, links to my fitness pal which is great as their food section is better. Shame you cant scan barcodes on this app. Also cant find the diabetes wellness program. Otherwise pretty standard. Would be great to be custimisable for those who train like boxing."
"Accurate on the real time step counts. However, it crashes all the time and my walks have not been counted on several occasions. Using a OnePlus 7T Pro. Fix this issue so I'm not being cheated on my activity and it will get a 5 star from me."
"Pretty terrible. There's no way to import step data, so if you want Samsung to register your daily steps, you either have to carry your phone with you everywhere, or pay Samsung for a fitness tracker. That fact renders this app absolutely useless compared to literally every other fitness app ever invented."
"This is an amazing health app from Samsung. Really awesome health tracking features and the monthly global competition is fantastic, encouraging users to compete to get fit. Currently using it with my galaxy watch active 2 and haven't had any issues at all. Will definitely recommend to anyone interested in fitness."
Great app. Would like a way to add a short comment to some of the features. Such as the stress checker. Then when you scroll back through the trends you would remember why stress spikes on a certain day.
Getting mixed recordings now and covering the same distance. I run 2.5 miles every morning yet the auto detect will now only recognise this after half a mile. Tech support and work around didn't fix the issue. If I have my watch and phone with me I now get two recordings both with conflicting information.
"This app won't update so that I can use the ECG or other features. I hit update and it takes me to a site that doesn't show an update button. I tried in the app, Firefox, Chrome, and Samsung internet and it will not allow me to update. It is a useless feature if it won't update so I can use it. I have a newer Samsung phone with all apps updated. The app shoes as updated. Useless"
It is not recording all the steps. I set my goal distance and it records the steps good but when I go to the home screen the steps recorded are about 2000 less and so on the challenge it does not take my actual steps/distance covered. It is so discouraging.I am recorded as having walked less. What is the sync for? I thought it was to make distances/steps tally. Example yesterday I walked 6.08km 12000 steps home screen records 10000 steps. Today I walked 6.1km home screen records 9000 steps.
"Update: app is now off by 4-8k steps every single day. Updating now last chance b4 delete. This WAS a 5 star app, but hasnt been since 2 updates ago. step count is off 2-7k steps a day! Im missing out on money from the achievement app due to this. I hoped last month's update would fix the previous one, but it actually got WORSE. Did company recommended fixes that I've seen posted here. 1st, they don't work. 2nd I shouldnt have to clear & force stop app every single day. No I'm not calling anyone"
"Broken after an update few weeks ago. Search does not work after doing the 1st search and entry to each meal, breakfast, lunch etc. You have to close the app then back in each time. Very frustrating."
"I loved using this app. Was a lot of fun seeing how many steps i could take and how active i could be in a day. I would give it 5 stars but for some reason it wants to have access to make phone calls...why? I used it to track activity/steps, not make a phone call...thats what my phone is for. That requirement off and I will install thus app again and give it 5 stars."
"Used to work just fine. After update , app will not sync with watch. I have tried uninstalling and installing app and clearing cache as suggested. I have several days where data has been lost."
The app does not calculate calories correctly. Calorie count on exercises is consistently and overwhelmingly lower than my Fitbit Charge. I have also contacted support twice and still have not been able to fix.
Deleted and found replacements. Everytime the app gets updated it get worse. Features taken away that were useful and useless stupid animations replaced. I have used this app for three years and I'm sad to lose that data but the devs took away half of the ways to see it.
"Used to be great until they removed the option to see weekly/monthly trends on everything.Now it blows. It really used to motivate me to see the trends for weight, blood pressure, etc. Now I can't. Why can't Samsung just fix it. Probably should have bought an iphone and apple watch."
"I got the last version of Galaxy watch as Valentin's day gifts, but when I opened the app for the first time, I encountered the 0040null61n2430 error, although I was not rooted my S8 plus ever. I tried all the work - reset, factory reset etc. but it did not worked. i live in Iran, guide me please"
Great app! Just made the switch from apple and I really dig the fact that it automatically calculates my calorie burn along with steps (jury is out on auto tracking what workout I do). Honestly it could well mean I won't need a fitbit anymore so I'm very pleased.
"For all the years I've used it in and out. And seriously put in effort to keep track of my intake, this app keeps evolving to be better. Now having said that, I feel stuff can be added to help with the little stuff more. ie. A reminder to drink water. But other than that. It's a good app!"
Not a bad app. Only problem I have is with the monthly events like September Tomato. Have they ever really looked at some of these ridiculous step counts. Sept 1st and some have already walked the equivalent of 85 miles (137 km). No f'in way.
Always fail to detect steps if you have another app turns on at the same time. For example when using music app and running at the same time Samsung Health always fails to pick up the steps. (p/s. I am not using Samsung phone)
The app is not user friendly for looking at day/week/month overview to see where you are up to. It gives me no additional motivation. I just tried one of the challenges to see if that would drive me but People clearly cheat making it pointless..... who walks/runs approx 60 miles a day every day?
"Keep getting network error, even though wifi and cellular, signals are strong. Last month or so, this has been happening. Plus for some reason, I had to log on to my account. Update:- ok will do. Thanks"
"I love this app. I think the ""together"" part with the map of step goals is pretty fun. It's exciting to see how many steps I get in and where I rank with others. I do think the app can be a bit confusing with all the buttons, it's hard for me to find parts of the app I was previously on. But overall, I like it so far."
"The best app for motivation & tracking workout. Extremely Fantastic App. I am changing my review from 5 to 3, because the inactive alert is no more working when connected to Samsung band. Which was very useful."
"Such an amazing app! It really did change everything in my life :) great meditation practices, pretty good music, and I really like how you can add different sceneries and sounds while meditation. Great work :)) ‚ù§"
"Useless app!!! Automatically stops tracking at a rest period, but then doesn't automatically restart when activity resumes. Your workout doesn't get recorded. Uninstalled and found better apps."
"Currently removing Samsung health in favour of another well known fitness app and tracker. I was hoping to combine the two but Samsung won't allow it! Such a shame, I used to love this app, and found it really useful. I also love my galaxy watch but that won't be used now either as due to the recent updates it no longer tells me the info I want. The updates have completely ruined it, in favour of these ridiculous ""challenges"". One user completed 193k steps on the first of April - doubt it! Shame"
I've tried different apps and always come back to Samsung Health. Only problem I've had with it is the voice progress alerts that quit working and the only fix is to uninstall it and reinstall it. Unfortunately that also erases my meals.
Had to turn it off just because of the annoying message every night that it's time to go to sleep. Unfortunately couldn't find a way just to turn that 1 aspect off so I had to turn everything off with it.
"The last update (8/5) took out the most important feature of the App ""Weight Management"". Why would you do this? It took me an hour to find an older version of the app and revert it back. Do yourselves a favor and add this feature back in the next update before you lose a lot of customers."
"Note to self: NEVER UPDATE AN APP THAT'S WORKING PERFECTLY FINE! Pie update messed up so many apps functionality, it's mind boggling! Edited Review: App update stopped logging in route and was inaccurate. CS here left # to call for assistance. Audrey was so nice. Unfortunately, couldn't recover many weeks of history üò±üò§ but she did try. SAVE YOUR DATA TO CLOUD B4 UNINSTALLING.I didn't but UNINSTALLING/reinstalling FIXED the bugs the o/s update created!"
"Instead of improvements after the updates, the weight management info got worse. The trends by weeks and months are gone. Now only shows daily weight which is so basic. This is real bad, may give up the app if I find better one."
"noticed after the new phone update, my galaxy watch no longer counts steps. when i open the phone app, then the phone syncs with the watch. hopefully its temporary. Thank you. I did try a few recommendations I found online. Then just over a day later it started counting steps."
"Used this app during the Pandemic to monitor O2 saturation and heart rate (the saturation is not that accurate and consistently read 4 points lower than a stand alone sat monitor, I have both) but can't get to it now without giving the app access to my entire life. Too intrusive. I just want to take my heart rate."
"Really disappointed that the weight management feature has been removed. Wow. I used to absolutely rely on this app daily to track my food and exercise and see my caloric intake, and now I can't. Please add the weight management feature back!"
"Keeps getting worse with every update. Now sets imperial weight scale down to 47.5 lbs, so trend shows straight line. Switching to metric allows for normal range that makes weight changes obvious. Weight & fat % trend lines can no longer be graphed on same display. Why was this feature deleted?"
My blood glucose data keeps falling off and now they have taken away the ability to track oxygen levels. It will take it with the stress level but will not retain the oxygen level data so that it can be retrieved later. Lots of problems lately.
"Good app, however the latest update on galaxy watch 4 has messed the treadmill run tracker up, the kilometers counting it's not accurate (way off from what it's shown on the treadmill itself) probably because the app turns on the GPS even for indoors run, many users are having that problem.. (Outdoors runs work perfectly), but you should give us a new update for the watch app in order to fix that problem about the treadmill.."
So far it has been so helpful and useful. The only thing I would rather have. Is the ability to scan barcodes to retrieve food information instead of having to manually enter everything. That's the only reason for 4 stars.
"Love the app. Needs a way to input laborus tasks like yard work, cleaning house, sweeping, washing vehicle, and a length of time input. Then the app could calculate the calories burned and use it in its calculations for daily use/intake."
"Thought I could use this app to connect my Samsung Gear Fit to my Samsung A10 without having to download the Gearfit Manager from the Samsung appstore (I'm Google based, so I don't trust their appstore or have a Samsung account). It seems this app is useless to Samsung Gear Fit & Gear Fit2 (2014 & 2016 fitness models). Looks like 3rd party apps are the only real option for me."
"Can not sort wieght by week, month or year anymore. This is one of only feature I use on the app. I like to see my weekly average weight not just day to day. It was nice to be able to see monthly average also. Can I get the old app back"
"New update has deleted the ability of tracking sleep patterns, unless you set a time frame to sleep, and you can no longer see the times spent in each sleep stage. As a shift worker I am interested in knowng what my sleep times are. Upgrades are supposed to enhance use not delete tracking systems. Paid heaps for a watch that has now taken away 1/2 of the reason I bought it. Big fail Samsung. Next phone upgrade will be Apple and an Apple watch."
I paid $400 for a smart watch that only syncs with this app and there is a GIANT ad banner at the top? Really? Not to mention the cost of the phone. Spent about $1500 on Samsung Galaxy products on this generation alone and am being shown ads that I cannot disable. Edit: Returning watch tomorrow and getting a fitbit. Uninstalling this app. Shame on samsung for treating it's customers this way.
"The last update destroyed the most useful feature of the app, weight management. I lost over 90 pounds using it to keep track of calories and exercises to judge my calorie deficits. Now it's just yet another mediocre health app. Negates the $400 Samsung watch I bought to go with it."
"Just got a new Watch4 and setup my Samsung login and pw. Initial login prompts for two-factor setup. ""Not now"" option just takes you back to the main login over and over... Actually setting up and verifying the code sent, the input field does not recognize that six #s were actually typed in, so no ability to proceed to the next step. No way to use Samsung Health AT ALL. Pixel 5"
Samsung health is so annoying. The problem started since 2 days where it doesnt share data with other apps like myfitnesspal. It keeps showing window to share this data but never connects with any other app. This is on galaxy s10+ and i have been using this service since ages. What's going on samsung?
"Since the update of this app on Nov. 29, I no longer have the ability to edit the Sleep time. My use of this app is to track the quality of my sleep and the new Samsung Watch never detected the correct time of my sleep and wake up so this app became garbage."
"Stopped working after the last phone update was applied the end of May. Followed your instructions and it still doesn't work. Will delete cache and data, uninstall, reinstall and stop the restore process. Will let you know if it starts working again."
My review was deleted by app developer. Will forward complaint to google. The suggestion i seen in my email was to open the app that i cannot open because their menus are blocking me access. From getting to those menus. I said the 2-step verification does not work and will not let me bypass and the access my to my contacts. This is bogus seeing as this is the only app to view data because you wont let me sync to google.
This app used to be decent now it is awful. They dropped floor tracking and the statistics you could do on all of your health data like the heart rate. The galaxy e watch heart monitor keeps stopping and the floor counting functionality is a complete disaster. Save your money don't get the watch or the app
I literally can't even set it up. I had to put in my account information twice because it kept crashing and it doesn't let me past the two step verification despite it being completed. Absolute garbage app
"Used this App for over two years. Now I cannot open it! I see nitice to accept privacy policy but unable to find in settings. Turned off my phone, Uninstalled and reopened. Now I lost all my data! What a mess. Prior to this I would have given it a 5 Star rating."
"Terrible tyrant that doesn't play well with other apps. I just want my steps reported to other apps. No matter how often I reset the settings, it always reverts to reporting net calories based on its own model instead."
I really love the app but with last update it took away some things I like to keep track of. Would really appreciate if the floors was added back and the part that would tell you if you were over or under calorie intake.
Good for basic health tracking and encouragement to keep going. Does not continuously bug you too keep installing more stuff and tracks things you need to know about. You can add friend so you can encourage each other. Works for me!
"I think this is a great app save for one concern, I have an issue with the Step counter, it stopped working after week 1 of using the app. Please advise on way forward as I have tried several attempts with no success."
"Could be better. The app tracks the phon and tge galaxy watch ,but does not track workouts ,unless you sign up for strava or technogym. That is weak. I use lf connect and google fit . Samsung is not syncing with them. So only google fit gives me my stepcount AND workout data ."
another useless app that is not needed especially when there are fit bits and other devices on the market to track your health with out having to go thru the hassle of opening an app strapping your phone to your arm or what have you. would like to completely remove this app as well but can't unfortunately.
"A good app, two items keeping it from a 5 for me. The indoor running tracking is way off for me about +25% each time. Also would be great to see total steps per week, month, year."
"I used this faithfully until this new update removed the weight management feature. Can we roll back?!?!? The app is pretty useless now for my fitness tracking as its all just basic logging now, I even bought a samsung watch to keep on track now its a waste as this weight management feature is gone. How can I rollback to an older version please?!?!"
Having had an issue logging in to the app I had given a low rating. After a minor update I can now access the app and I have to say I like it. I've yet to use it to it's full potential but works with my Galaxy Fit2 which I am also happy with.
I loved this app and recommended it to my family but i was disappointed of the removal of weight management I don't see our benefit for removong this feature. Many of us will be glad if you returned this feature. I hope returning this feature is an option and will happen very soon!
This is a good app. I used to run with the programs in it. Like run 5 kilometers or baby steps for running. Run 10 kilometers run but now after last update I couldn't find any of them. Before I could be able to choose my work out interest and the app offered me some rekated programs but now nothing üôÑüòî
Please bring back oxygen saturation as a separate item. Stress takes too long to check and does not tell me much. It hardly moves. I am still using the old version so I can get the oxygen saturation separately. (S9 note )
Not very accurate in counting steps. I did 6000 + steps on another app but this app only counted 2000+. You need to keep an eye on it constantly to make sure it's working otherwise you lose so many steps. Fix the problem. Wouldn't really recommend. Better apps elsewhere.
I really enjoy the app!! I just don't understand why they don't update automatically when you on a challenge with your friends. You have to keep refreshing the app to get both people new numbers and I dont like that
Keep getting error saying app can't open on rooted phone... but this is not a rooted phone... sent email to developer... still waiting for a response. and yes. I've uninstalled and reinstalled the app and it is still giving the error
All of a sudden it now needs permission to manage phone calls. So my Galaxy Active watch is now useless unless you can manage my phone calls. No way! Let me use it without these unnecessary extra permissions or I'm going to the media.
"I used this app for 8 months. It is very intrusive and wants to have control over just about everything on your phone. If you let it, it will monitor what you do on all your other phone apps so it can natter at you about screen time. It will also natter at you about your sleep time and other things about your life. Up until today I was able to disable these ""nattering"" features. This morning when I tried to use it, a new version had been downloaded but it would not let me in. It wanted full admin control of my phone, including my contacts and phone. Even when I gave it these permissions it still would not let me in. It kept saying I hadn't given it all the permissions it wanted, but it would not tell me what was missing. It just sent me to the apps permissions page. I finally rebooted and it still would not let me in. Then I noticed it had already changed a bunch of settings on my phone WITHOUT INFORMING ME. I was angry. I uninstalled the app. I am still searching my phone settings to try and figure out what settings it changed. Dear Samsung Health Developers, this is overreach on the use of my phone and it is extremely invasive. I also consider it an extreme security risk. You don't need all this access and permissions. I see you are giving the following ""canned response"" to others who are also complaining about this new feature. ""We want to assure you that the app permissions that you grant when installing the app are used only for implementing the app features and for providing the user optimal experience. None of the information is used for any other purpose nor is it shared with any other parties."" PLEASE DO NOT WASTE MY TIME AND YOURS BY GIVING ME THE ABOVE CANNED RESPONSE. You may promise this now, but such promises of privacy can easily be changed on short notice. It is a security risk because if there is a bug in your program, it can be hacked giving the hacker full access to the phone. Maybe you have conveniently forgotten or maybe you are too young to remember but there was a time when a Samsung CD installed a root tool kit on any computer that used it. I WILL NEVER USE THIS PROGRAM AGAIN UNTIL YOU GET RID OF ALL THESE PERMISSION REQUREMENTS!!!!!! ------------------------------------ Edit: 08/09/2021 Dear Samsung Company My original review still stands. You just gave me your canned ""privacy response"", which I told not to do. So I read thru your privacy statement and what your privacy statement says does NOT seem to agree with what you are stating here in public. Please show me EXACTLY in your privacy statement where it states you will only use this data for the app itself. There is another VERY ANNOYING feature of this app. Even though I UNINSTALLED IT, at least once a week I get a notification message stating that I have to agree to your new privacy statement and I have to allow Samsung to have access to all features of my phone. There is no way to stop these notifications since the app is not on my phone. Unless you enjoy getting this sort of constant nattering and badgering then DO NOT INSTALL THIS APP."
"I use the health widget on my home screen for years, for daily steps. For some reason in the last update the text has been greatly reduce. Its Tiny, but the box has stayed the same size. Please sort this out ASAP. You should be able to customise the box text/numbers for steps"
"I had my initial review removed by the dev instead of actually responding to it. But, I will try to post it again. The app does a tardy job of counting steps. For some reason, post update the app doesn't count steps anymore unless it has been kept open which really defeats the point of this app."
"Removing the weight management widget from the app was a kick in the groin. Never again am i buying a samsung smart watch or even a phone, you can bet my next phone will be a google phone. It was the most if not the the only great feature of the app, removing it made 0 sense for something that already worked great. FU samsung seriously"
"EXTREMELY broken app. I got my Galaxy Watch 3 two days ago, and have had to resend friend requests at least five times to the same people because it keeps deleting my damn friends. It also has kicked me out of the monthly challenges several times since it first got my new Watch. I am SICK AND TIRED of having to resend friend requests to the same people multiple times DAILY. FIX THIS PATHETIC APP!! I am PISSED! Especially because of how expensive these god damned Watches are!!"
"This app stole my Google play balance. I bought was given a $10 google play gift card and I redeemed it the next day I went to look for an app or something to purchase and it said there was only 38 cent available, so I looked at the recent transactions page and this app was right on top with the date of when I redeemed my gift card. Doesn't say what I paid for, just shows the app itself. Which for one is free... and came on my phone, and two I never purchased anything inside the app.. I'd like my money to be refunded immediately. As you stole it with out my knowlage or permission. You should get a lawsuit and have t ok pay me more but I'd be happy with just my 10$ you stole put back into my google play balance. Thank you. Not really though..."
Cannot sign in. Following the purchase of a Samsung fit2 I've tried to log in for the first time in a while. Had to reset password etc which was fine. However now when trying to log in I'm greeted with just a spinning log in symbol which won't progress even after uninstalling and reinstalling.
"With the latest update on Jan 26th, the total # of grams of consumed carb/fat/protein is restored in Food screen, that's good! The improved Exercise History and Summary looks nice! But the Weekly & Monthly Avg Weight and Water Consumption is still missing; and the nutrition score has not been restored in Food screen either. Waiting for those features to be restored. Plus, will you be able to add the count of Healthy Steps? Some other apps have this feature."
"Go back to the old version. Poor use of screen space, liked it much better when all the square tiles showed everything on one screen and I didn't have to touch the phone to scroll up and down all the time."
"I love this app. I have struggled with my weight for the last couple of years and Samsung health is making it easier for me to lose all the weight I gained. The app is complete and on it you can find suggestions of exercises, you can track your food and water intake, you can track how active you are during the day, how many calories you burnt vs consumed. I use this app daily and I cannot live without it anymore."
"I have a good aver all experience with this app. One thing I wish was better is how the measurements of stress/heart rate/oxigen level are displayed. The numbers are very, very small and there is plenty room on the screen that is not utilized. Why those numbers are so tiny? That annoyes me. Please make the readings bigger."
"Since 22nd May the app has gone to pot. Will no longer log any exercises that my Samsung Watch records. Unistalled and reinstalled, resyncd the watch etc. Nothing fixes it. Still tracks steps but says ive done no exercise... Frustrating! I give up"
I love app but I can't sylnc with mfp. If I workout that day with Samsung doesn't transfer data to mfp only from mfp to Samsung health and its double my exercise. That's annoying. I've tried everything and talk to customer service and nothing. I'm thinking to go back to Fitbit I never had this problem. You shouldn't have this problem with almost $400 watch
It works now ! and I can use the full extent of my galaxy wacht 4
"I used Google Fit before but when I discovered Samsung Health have support for sleep hours, period tracker, kcal goal, how much you have to eat and exercise to lose weight, reminder of drinking water AND real-time step counter, I will not going back to the app I used to use. It's so good! ALL IN ONE"
"I, too, am stuck in some sort of loop. I try to set up 2-step authentication, get the text message and code, enter the information and the Verify button doesn't function at all. This has rendered my device useless."
"I enjoy the app. it makes me aware of a lot of things. I like seeing and recording my meals it slows me down some. I also keep track of my bp. when I arrive at work I turn on walking for exercise. If I forget to turn it off when I get off work it records my commute as me walking, I don't like that. It doesn't seem to know the difference in me walking for exercise and me driving."
"I always enjoy samsung health, and the challenges, plus winning against competition. It isn't a hard app, and everyone involved, is actually a good person and competitor. They're isn't jealousy and games. All friendly, and no pain. And I'm sick of other people trying to intervene when all you want to do is work out."
I liked the app at first but then when I tried to use it to track my calories as well it always says that I'm over the amount of calories I should eat. Bear in mind that I haven't entered in any food yet and turned off the function for it to track it automatically.
"Changing my review due to issues I and others are having. Why so many features have been removed is beyond me. This was a great app, then more and more was stripped out for no reason I am aware of. Don't get me wrong, the app had worked well for me, the score is for the removal of functions over the last two years."
"Hi. love the app, but I have other app that I use for running. Noticed that this one the kilometres are always higher than the other one. Did walk on Saturday and other people recorded 8km and I recorded 12km same route. that left me confused a bit."
"It's a good app. But it doesn't have a option to include rest days, so let's say you've reached your goal through the week but in the rest day an alarms comes and say you didn't achieve your goal today!üòÖwell It's kinda disturbing!"
"Hello, I have been using this app since a longtime now and had no problem using it in fact I loved it. But after my phone received an android 10 update the app was not working in the background and after the screen was locked. Please look into the issue Thank you"
"What happened to the sensors such as heart rate? Have they been taken off? Why doesn't Samsung Health sync with Health Mate anymore? I don't want to fill information in two different places. I have already uninstalled and reinstalled, cleared cache, restarted my phone. Nothing. Just let me now if these features have been taken off then I will just uninstall this app it is worthless."
"I wrote you that my steps don't work properly. I tried what told me but there is ads in the way and no way to pause. I emailed you and that doesn't help. Its a no reply. My heartrate doesn't work either. Ready to uninstall and never use again. My phone is Samsung A21, previous phone Samsung Galaxy 5. Worked fine. Very frustrated because I loved the app. Peggy"
there's no way to clear personal data as far as I can tell. I mistakenly gave the app my height and now when I enter my weight every day I get a bright red OBESE label under my BMI which is enough to make me look for a different app entirely. VERY demotivating.
"New Active 2. New Tab A7...they won't connect! Want larger screen to monitor my health but samsung says NO ! Guess I will have to get an iPad and apple watch. They work together. Bad business model Samsung! I have lots of samsung products,,, will rethink any additional products from you after this. Got a reply from Samsung offering help with the App.. the problem is hardware connectivity between the watch and tablet!"
No O2 Saturation. Going backwards in time. Couldn't wait to upgrade my phone after 4 years but figured out that it was a downgrade instead. Just ridiculous that features are removed instead of added. Congratulations Samsung and Google with your big flop! Double thumbs down üëéüëé
I hate this latest update.. i used this app to track distance for my virtual marathons. since the update it has not displayed the distance.. the very few times it did it got the distance awfully wrong . I know its inaccurate since. I have been running the entire pandemic so im familiar with my numbers Ive wasted a lot of runs bec its only until the end that i discover that the distance is not tracked..pls correct thia Asap
"doesn't work since the last update, i only get to the ""privacy policy updated"" screen, but nothing happens after that. reinstalled the app and now all my data is gone, what's the point of signing in with an account when nothing syncs?"
"Removal of the weight management section was bad enough, now you want to force me to create an account to use the app? No thanks. Can just track the data in a spreadsheet instead seen as that's all this app has become useful for now, knowing this I don't think the next wearable I get will be a Samsung one, poor experience."
This app continues to lose steam. I used every bit of the original app and was stoked. Seems like all corporations need to fix what isn't broken. Loyalty to brand names isn't worth it. Screw the little guy seems to be the name of the game. Bring back the original app that was preloaded on my S9+.
"Terrible and useless. It was initially a good application but with every update it is becoming worse. I don't know who is sitting on that job of updating. Yesterday's update made it worst. I am a regular Walker and cover 4 to 5 km. I know my speed which is around 5-6 km per hour. It sometimes declares it 0 km. Sometimes 2.8, 3.7, even sometimes 7.8 km. After yesterday's update it is completely jammed. In response they immediately updated the app which is now working."
"I used to like that the app gave me a detailed look at my sleep quality by showing me light, REM, and deep sleep. Now it is just a line of blue bars that are worthless. Please bring back the detailed sleep feature, even if you have redesigned it."
The app is not bad but not great either. I track my food intake and my steps and training with this app. This works okay as long as I don't go horse back riding and have my phone with me. Even if I start horse riding on the app it still counts the steps. That is pretty stupid since I can not sit on my horse and walk by self at the same time. When finish riding the app shows me about 8000 steps my horse probably made but not me.
Like so many other people I will not give you permission to access my contacts. It also wanted to access photos. I dumped the app and will find another or go without. I used to like this app but when I got a new phone I had to update and won't let me access it until I give permission now your going to far. I'll pass
"Your two step authentication does not work with me, sorry! I have no problem with app. It's the process of authentication that is a problem. Somewhere between yr sending the code and yr confirmation. I had to revert to the factory app."
"You should be able to change the time you day starts/ends. I work nights (5p-2am) and the last few hours of my day automatically go onto the following day, which is inaccurate."
"It's ok for ""Bloatware"". Basically I have other apps that do the same thing with better interface. I don't need it in a one-stop shop app. Especially if Samsung decides to stop supporting it. Using SG8+/tablet."
"This app no longer works effectively since an 'upgrade' a couple of months ago. It no longer auto-detects walking activity on commencing, you need to set an activity manually, and the robotic voice over is annoying and unpredictable."
"Hi, im using galaxy note 20 ultra 5g, the app is not recording my exercise workout and not syncing with healthy 365 app. Yesterday was still fine. Ive tried to uninstall and reinstall to the latest app. Restart my phone. Still cannot work. How else can i fix it? Thanks."
"I still hate your app. I hate that I keep trying to sync it with my watch. It has to resync and resync and still never syncs. I hate electronic devices, but when I try to get things done, I get jipped. Please fix."
"I love this app and I would give. 5 stars if I could could find every item on menus. I ate soup and a wrap from Chicken Salad Chick and neither was on the list. Also, you have Bicycling on your app but you do not have anything for a Stationary Bike. Please add these things or give me some advice on what to use in the place of these things on your app. Thank you. I hope you can understand."
"I don't think a health app should be able to read messages, emails and have access to manage my phone calls and contacts. WHAT'S THE PROPOSE? I don't understand and then they won't let you access the app without giving them ALL the permissions they want."
"Good app, not sure how accurate the food calories are as in my fitness pal the total is less. If your goal is to lose weight then this could be helpful. My goal is to build muscle so i find I'm having to eat more than this app says to account for the discrepancies. For example, if i eat 3k kcal in this app, the same foods entered in my fitness pal is 2.7k kcal. All in all though i like the app and is helping me achieve my goals. (I mean the kcal for food entered, nothing a cache clear will fix)"
"Weekly steps tracker. I see the app works differently for iOS and android. I cant see weekly steps, I only see todays, last 7 days, 30 days etc. It is very frustrating. I could see it in the older version. I hope the developers restates that."
"I now officially HATE Samsung. I am extremely unhappy with all of the unneeded security that I have been forced to apply to my Samsung account. Today, I was FORCED to setup 2 factor authentication. I don't need or want this. I only use my Samsung account to track data on my workouts with my smartwatch. This extra security is not necessary in my situation. Also, stop making me enter my password just to update apps on my smartwatch. Also, let me reset my password to a previously used one."
"I used to really enjoy using this app to track my meals, but when they removed the option to add nutrition information for my own foods (recipes) I have not been able to use this app and now use a separate app to track nutrition intake. I cook most of my foods from scratch and using just their database of pre-packaged foods is useless without the ability to put in my own nutrition information for the foods I eat."
Great so far. like the galaxy watch integration and feed back. my only gripe so far is I would like to see barcode reader for scanning food like some other apps have. makes food entry so much easier.
"Really doesn't do much, won't sync with my Samsung wearable, heart rate and oxygen sat is cool, gimmicky, and completely inaccurate. Seems like Samsung just wanted to have an app, but didn't really care to make it useful."
"I think, this is one of the best Samsung in-build apps. The app itself helps to maintain one's necessary health measures like calories intake, water intake, daily foot steps, daily active time and much more. It also helps to manually set up your daily sleep time. It's free of ad. It also helps to lose weight and gives helpful notifications. Users of this app can attain a healthy life by checking up the app daily."
I like the app very much but sometimes the sleep tracking has issues - meaning that the data slipping - I use a Gear Fit pro2 watch and it shows the correct hours and in the phone app it shows like an hour later - like sleeping from 22:30 to 7:30 and in the app it turns out 23:30 to 8:30. And if I rate my sleep it may slip with another additional hour... Do you have a solution?
"Since the app came pre-installed on my S7 edge, I trusted its accuracy to resonable limits. I installed it on my non-Samsung phone. I have found <80% accuracy on the newer phone (on steps) walking a known fixed distance."
"""Samsung Health is more than just a glorified step or calorie tracker."" As an owner of Samsung phones and Galaxy watch, the app has been effective for me with the challenges and monitoring of steps and exercises with the helpful choices of other health management items. The latest update is surprising and disappointing. The weekly summaries are not as simple and convenient for comparisons now. Please restore the average monthly summaries for the steps and non-step items. Monthly views provided a big picture of the effectiveness of ""steps"" with other related health management items."
"Using Samsung health for years now as I am faithful to Samsung phones. Just started adding calorie to diet. The quality, per centage and values of calories, potassium, and other micro nutrients is extremely inaccurate. A lot of Indian cuisine not pre embedded. Such a shame from a big leader. Way behind other health apps."
"I was working on a running program before this update. After the update, the program dropped and now I can't pickup where I was! I have to start all over! There has to be an option to continue without redoing 8 weeks of work."
"Very cross that I am forced to give app telephone permissions or the app won't work. Why would you even need these permissions?! Looking for another calorie counting app and smart watch now. Not impressed! Have seen that others are complaining of the same thing and samsung are just giving a meaningless reply. You will lose users over this, please change it."
"Removing the weight management section has rendered this app almost useless now. I would make minor tweaks and adjustments to my diet based on my goals, losing fat/gaining muscle/more or less active one week to the next etc. This is now a headache to do. I'll move to another app after years of using this If using another brand of android phone it is awkward logging in. *I eventually skipped the step of logging in and removed my Samsung account from the list of sync options. Re-added & it worked"
"Amazing, my review disappeared. Samsung, you lost a few clients for good. This was my review: "" It was nice until the two step verification. Even if I wanted to give permission to this application, and I don't want to. I don't have coverage so I will never pass the thing Take out the two steps or allow me to remove the bad application. Or I will not buy anymore Samsung phones. Easy. Samsung, please do not cut and paste an answer, this show you don't care about your customers. And this will make me to get other phones for me and family."" And considering the ""nice"" ""standard"" Paste"" reply from Samsung I know a lot of people that will not buy anymore Samsung phones."
"Best health app out there! Been using it for 3 years now and I am fully satisfied! Currently I use it on my Galaxy S8 and my Gear Fit 2 Pro! With Samsung Gear, you can step up the game quite a bit! Don't need to look at how many steps I have done on my phone, I simply have my watch on my wrist and don't even have to take my phone everywhere! Amazing job, Samsung! :)"
"what's with the 2fa? you don't have to give them your phone number, but if you don't, the app won't work. and if you do, the sms code does not arrive half the times. I have never seen so many errors in my life as in those two days I am trying to use Samsung apps (wearables, plugin, accessories and now this...)! and why on earth do I need to install four (four!) apps to use one ""fitness"" band???"
"Why would you remove weight management??? This is a health app. Calories in and calories out are kind of important (duh) and the way weight management integrated them helped me so much. This app (and watch) are useless now. It doesnt make sense to remove features as ""improvement."" Either add more or make it better. Youve made it worse and ill probably switch back to garmin. I dont like that you removed myfitnesspal as a connection also. It almost feels like a joke this ""update"" was so bad."
"Wonderful until recent update. Why the insistence of requiring access to my camera, contacts etc? I uninstalled this awful update but it wormed it's way back. I'm now getting my exercise by working out how to remove the app altogether and replace it. I see that im not alone with this problem. If anybody can suggest a good replacement to what WAS a really good and useful app I'd be delighted to hear about it. (I wonder if Samsung are taking any notice of us?)"
This app is amazing. It allows me to track my activity and my rest without having to think a out it. Having a smart watch as well is helpful so I don't have to lug my phone around when I don't want to. I live being able to track my caloric intake as well. That and my caffeine & water intake. I ‚ô° H2O...WATER....WATER....WATER!! BUT I don't always drink as much as I should. I get dehydrated too quickly. I don't drink soda but I DO need to drink more water.
"Samsung Health you used to be awesome. I don't know what you did ... but it's not calculating my steps correctly at all. I wake up in the morning and I have like 2,000 steps already and I know I didn't have my phone during the night walking... Hahaha. You guys need to work on your app before you lose people's interest in you."
I like it so far but it would be nice to add a peak flow tracker for asthma and maybe a temperature as well. In reply to the response I didn't ask for SpO2 but for a l/min peak flow tracker so I don't need an other app. Your reply makes me question if they have the right people programming this app. Update: 1/16/21 do not like at all the new update. Can't check weekly or monthly averages
"Latest update was no improvement. Please revert the ""price is right"" wheel used to enter BP. Entry was much easier before. Further, the default should be your prior reading, not 120/80. Also, the app badly needs a body temperature item for daily recording."
"This app was really useful until they removed all the weight/calorie tracking tools, leaving it effectively useless. You can enter the data for food eaten and calories burned (from wearable), but the app does not display it."
"The weight management feature was essential to me. When they've removed it without warning, the app became practically useless. I was planning to buy Samsung wearables to use with this app but I'll go for some other brand now. You've lost my business Samsung. :("
Today I've tried to enter data manually. Set data in all required fields and press the button Save. But it doesn't work. When I press the button nothing happens. I can only Cancel this action. Have you any troubles with that? Let me know. Thanks!
Very frustrated with the removal of the calorie manager. I've been using this app since the start of my weight loss journey and this was the feature that set it apart from the competition.
"It's a solid app, but the weight section needs to have more information just your BMI though. You acknowledge the BMI is not accurate, so why you guys have not included more accurate options? The tape method or the various skin fold tests are more accurate alternatives, so why not incorporate them?"
"Just about ready to dump this app. Food database is rubbish and still can't scan barcodes. And despite this, you continue to intentionally cripple integration with 3rd party apps that can do this things this app cannot. A person's diet is the single most important factor in losing weight. S** you Samsung."
"The app no longer consistently track my resting heart rate and I no longer receive all notifications. I can contacted customer care, Samsung health app department and no one seems knowledgeable about a fix. I've had this watch3 since November 13 and nothing but problems. My Fitbit2 worked perfectly fine, bit my children thought this to be a better watch, so they bought it for me for my birthday. If I want consistent information I usually wear my fitbit along with the watch3."
"Great app but it straight up doesn't work after the newest update. It won't even run, even after I gave all the permissions (A LOT, by the way, don't know why essentially a calorie counting app needs permission to make calls from my phone). If I could give 0/5 stars I would"
"From ~6/21, it demands to know your phone number, contacts, & manage calls, in order for the ü§° ""Together"" feature to allow ""friends"" to send stupid challenges WHICH I DON'T WANT. The app gives no option to decline the permission, & thus HOLDS TO RANSOM your previous readings & logs, by preventing access unless you agree to their new demands. GFY Samsung ü§¨, I won't use this app or trust you with my data again. (Your previous reply telling me this was an improvement was ridiculous) üëéüëéüëéüëéüëé"
"I used this app a lot it was amazing and super helpful. Since the last update my fitness section does not even work. It just says no videos available. I have a gym membership and they also have an app but I like the programs here better, now I can't even use it. I guess I'll be using the gyms app now."
The steps seem to be pretty inaccurate. I cannot get the app to connect to my fitness pal and adding food is a pain. I do however really enjoy the Together feature. If only I could connect to MFP I'd give a better review
"I like the connectivity and support with my smart watch. The only problem I have is that I can't manually input details of a past workout. I have workouts that aren't auto recorded and there us no way for me to input details of time, calories, burned, etc. Or is there a way to do this and I am not seeing it?"
"The app is totally useless if you are looking for the weight management features. It's showing you the same number of ""calories you can eat"" no matter how active you are in different days of which weight goal do you set. I was experimenting entering different (ridiculous) goals, like gaining 20 kg or loosing 30kg from my current weight: it is showing me the same number, 1578 ccal. I tried to enter different starting weight, from 50 to 80 kg, it shows me the same number. Not recommended at all."
I bought a Samsung Watch last weekend and was excited to use it to start tracking my exercise and challenge my husband in a step contest. I do not have a Samsung phone and am unable to even log into my account-it just goes to a white screen. I did call customer service but they were not any help-just have to wait for it to be updated. Im really considering taking the watch back for a brand that will work with my phone. Btw my husband has a watch and a samsung phone and can log in to see his data
i hope my previous comment is shown bc this is an edited version now. i am not pleased one bit with this app. it keeps getting worse and worse and won't stop popping up on my screen when the app isn't even being in use telling me my phone is rooted. finally DELETED this app and I'm probably gonna be done with Samsung phones for life bc of this. I honestly owned Samsungs for years specifically for THIS APP. üíî
I used to love the previous version. This new one is horrible as it wants permission from quite a lot of things including contacts etc. Why should I give these ? An App supposed to provide unique sporting experience and now it looks like a tracking software trying to steal personal infos. So I just deleted it. And that is it. I will propose Samsung considers providing App Health 1 (old version) and App Health 2 (new version) to give people choices. I am sure 90% of users will go for App 1.
"After years of being with LG phones, I'm back to Sammy with the Z Fold 3,and thus switching back to Samsung Health from LG Health. While overall comparable products, S Health is lacking in its list of workouts: there should be ""General Upper-body"" and ""General Lower-body"" selections. It's also missing Tennis of all things! Also, as an outdoor runner AND cyclist, GPS works great for running but doesn't work AT ALL for cycling! The GPS icon doesn't light up for either--it just says ""Not in use."""
"I track my heart rate due to a medical condition. I can no longer view the information from my watch on the app such as my continuous HR measurements. I need to know this information. Now my watch doesn't get calls, text notifications, now this. Samsung is rendering itself useless and I'll be switching to Apple after 13 years."
I enjoy but sometimes it gets a little annoying bc I feel like Everytime I move it's tracking me I don't know how to adjust it to make it not so sensitive to every single move I make. It could be the watch tho too. Samsung Galaxy Active 2 it kills my battery so fast it's depressing. Other than that I use it regularly and am generally happy with it
I admire the quick response. Samsung PR must be in turbo mode . However the simple truth is there are other apps that do what I need and don‚Äôt even need me to login in. If I wanted the ‚Äò together‚Äô feature ( whatever it is ) then I may choose your app but to me and many others you have just blown the legs off your credibility and to just tell us we should trust you is extraordinarily arrogant. That said I wish you luck and hope one day you regain our trust
"This app is good, but it lacks some features that I hope will be included in an update. I would like to see feature that allows you to create a group that contains selected Samsung Health members all in the hope challenging each other in certain sports activities."
"Used to work fine, now the manual recording of workouts (yoga/meditation being the example) doesn't work properly. The time set for recording a workout is an hour behind. Inconvenient."
"Your two-factor identification update is terrible. No matter how many times I complete it, the app won't let me move past that step, making it unusable. REALLY FRUSTRATING! 4/17/21 - Update based on Company Response: I already entered and verified the stored version of my phone number over 30 times. At least 5 times I even entered my phone number as a new number, got text codes to validate the number, and verified it. The app still will not let me move on. STILL REALLY FRUSTRATING."
"Removal of the weight management function makes this app and my Galaxy watch useless. The features for stress measure measurement and Oxygen levels has also been removed. I previously used all these features, and loved the functionality it provided. I regularly raved to friends and family about how well featured and useful it was for managing many aspects of my health. Im struggling to understand why the features have been removed."
I have a Samsung S3 watch connected to an LG v50 phone. About eight months ago it stopped calculating my stairs climbed. I work in construction and I am up and down the ladder all day and up and down stairs walking through buildings. The last time I calculated any stairs was a month ago and before that it had gone for months saying I had not gone up even one flight of stairs. I have two flights of stairs in my house and go up and down them all the time. It's incredibly annoying do not have this.
"I did like the app but after a recent update it is no longer working. it says it wont open on a rooted device but my phone is not rooted. it's never been rooted. I have no idea how to root a phone. it's very frustrating cause I do use the app a lot and now I cant open it. no solutions online or anything. what the hell, Samsung?"
"When you update an app you're supposed to improve it, not make it worse. The layout is terrible. The sleep section has worsened considerably, not even recording two sections of sleep like it used to. Seriously, someone needs to be taken aside and told that they need to buck their ideas up."
"I have a few items I'd like to mention. One I do bench aerobics which is not listed. I use the step machine as an alternative to keep track of my workouts. This is the closest alternative to what I do every day. I do have a complaint about recording stairs. I climb 20 stairs ea. way from my apartment, every day 4 to 5 x's A-day just to let my dogs out go to the bathroom. If I'm lucky 2 times may be recorded for the day. No matter what I do, it does not record stairaccurately. Hope you can fix."
"I bought their flagship Note 20 Ultra 5G phone and am very disappointed with this app. I could deal with the O2 and stress sensor hardware removal on the phone. However, Samsung Health won't even let me enter the information manually! App upgrades have removed features; just like the phone itself. It appears that Samsung is now disconnected with the needs of its customers. Sad."
"Hi, I've been trying to find a way in app to notify you that the nutritional information you have for the applesauce I'm eating (Kroger brand ""Classic Apple Sauce"") doesn't match what's on the label. For example, the label lists that there is 0mg of Sodium and every brand of Apple sauce on the app has 15mg or more. So I can't trust now when the app tells me I'm over on my sodium intake. I don't need to be able to change it, but it would be nice to flag foods so y'all can look into it."
The x-axis scale in Weight management is too large. I could see the weight loss only 3 to 4 months in a single screen. Also could introduce year wise. By the way I got a notice that weight management is going to be removed in next version 6.11. Is it true?. Because this management tool was really useful.
Why have separate categories for what would be a total workout. Option to group activities would be good so i dont have to keep stopping to tell device what I'm doing. I should be able to say why my heart rate is high when doing short workout. Not be lectured that i should contact Dr from my phone app! Very poor for a top of the line phone app! I wonder if you'll listen?
"After having issues for months with no resolve, graphs not working and synching is completely wrong, with no actual response from anyone, this is my third negative review in 3 months. since recently years of data was erased I have no need to keep this app. Would give 0 stars"
I really like this application most the time. I am pregnant and it annoys me there is no option to put yourself as pregnant so it tells me I am Obese everyday. Also for some reason it dosen't always want to count my steps all thought I am not sure if that's my phone or the app. Please make Pregnancy an option for women.
"Wow! This app was great told me when I was having heart issues. With the last update they want permission to access your phone calls, texts ,and all your info and if not you can't use it. Way to let your greed ruin something many of us need. I have no insurance no doctor I used this app to self diagnose so thank you for taking my only form of health care. Uninstalled. Got same generic response as everyone else are there any damn people there. This is a tracking scam obviously."
"I'm not happy. I spent hours, literally, solving this (in my case). The problem is Samsung is using a Browser to ""Sign In"". It resolved when, in Android Settings, I made my Samsung Browser Beta the Default Browser. Samsung gives a list of acceptable browsers, but whichever acceptable browser you use must be assigned as the Default Browser in Android."
"Bought your new S22 ULTRA, so now it doesn't sync anymore with my galaxy watch active 2, have setup watch with phone Uninstaller the health app and reinstalled a few times, still now result. Maybe you could update the new phone so it will work, syncing worked without any problems on the S21Ultra..."
"Step counter won't restart after midnight. I need to restart my s22 ultra again every day for the step counter to start counting again. Not very pleasant for the price I paid for a premium phone. Updated: tried all the suggestions: pause counting and restart, clear cache and force stop, etc. The only way to make the app recount my step is to restart the phone. Very tiresome thing to do every day."
loved this app. but after the last update and Android upgrade the app keeps closing. the step counter only seems to count when in the app. i have sent a log of the error. i see others have had the same issue this week . please fix
"I use this app for a step counter. The step counter is very inaccurate. I'm someone who is on ther feet for about 14 hours per day (school and being a full time pharm tech in a large specialty facility does that to you). My husband who works in the same facility as me, gets over 10 thousand steps per day. With this app it says I'm lucky to reach 2 thousand steps in a day (my phone is always in my pocket). Very inaccurate."
It's inconsistent and lags
"Edited: thank you to the Samsung Health team! About a week or so ago, they had released an update that hid the total gram calculations for macros (which made it inconvenient for me as I would have to manually calculate the total grams for certain macros). They not only replied to the feedback but also made the change in their next update. Their total calorie calculations are still wrong but I am updating my review to reflect my satisfaction with their recent update. :)"
"Update 2: Just found out that Samsung was sued last year about their weight management and sharing functions, and that's why they removed it from the app, but did not have the balls to tell their loyal customers that they would be losing a beloved app function. Sad. Update: You did your big Jan updates AND STILL NO WEIGHT MANAGEMENT! ADD. IT. BACK! I used the Samsung Health app to lose more than 20 pounds with the weight management functions. All of a sudden it gets removed? I contacted the Health app support and was told it ""might"" get added back in the future. I know a ton of people who used this function and are upset that it's gone. Didn't even get a warning about it's removal. ADD. IT. BACK!"
"Ever since they started requiring me to use two factor authentication I cannot get into the app anymore. It gives me an error every time. Not amount of clearing my cache, uninstalling, or resetting my phone helps. Now I have a mostly useless Samsung watch and an entirely useless Samsung App."
"I was extremely happy to obtain my Galaxy 3 watch. I was then immediately disappointed by the fact that Samsung has been so deceptive by advertising the BP and related health monitoring, but it is only available with a Samsung cell phone. I have a Oneplus Pro 8 android phone and you would think Samsung would be honest enough to either tell folks that only Samsung phones work with the Watch 3, or when they plan on releasing an addition to their health program whereby we can all access the BP etc. health monitoring. I have used Samsung products on and off since 1996. Other than a speaker issue with an early TV, this is the only, and most, disappointed I have been. You are missing sales Samsung, as word of mouth effects all businesses."
The developers seem to not have a lot of work so they break the app and then they have to fix it. The last 2 updates were really bad. One broke the food part and the last one the sleep part the sleep data is not sync with my active watch 2.
"It's OK for a free app. I like the challenges, but sometimes it doesn't record the steps you've taken. There should also be a way to manually add steps if you've had to plug your phone in and use a pedometer or at the gym with the phone on the machine"
"Prior to today's update I would Rate a FIVE After today's phone update I cannot add any workout times because the search times out, it no longer tracks my steps, I have lost ALL of my workouts and walks over the last 2 years, and I cannot update my sleep times. What the heck? Please get this app back to whatever this recent update screwed up. I'm not calling. RETURN APP TO PREVIOUS FUNCTIONALITIES. Thank you."
"I have be using this app for years and had it rated as 5 stars , it still has good features but the removal of the weight management feature was a terrible decision and has significantly reduced my enjoyment of the app, I'm still confused as to why that decision was made because it has not made the app better and customers haven't been happy about it and been vocal about it for some time and nothing has changed. It seems as though you do not care about your customers samsung"
The weight management feature if what really made this app ideal. I have no idea why they would remove it but without it the app doesn't really satisfy. This is simply a basic exercise tracker and food log without it.
Absolutely not worth using anymore! The main thing I used this app for was the heart rate monitor/tracker that is no longer available?? I can't find it anywhere in the app. I am Uninstalling because it is pointless to keep on my phone taking up space.
"I'm LOVING this app!--been using it for about a week. I'm liking the programs. It's fun to share my progress with my hubby. I have some suggestions though.  1) create a feature to manually organize/favorite workout Programs in the Discovery area. This way, when we're ready to start a program, we don't have to go searching for it.   2) In the Food Logging area, we need more categories beyond ml, Cal, etc. Let's add things like ""teaspoon, tablespoon, oz, gram, qt, mililiter, etc. The ""Carb Manager"" app does an AMAZING job at this. Please don't make us have to go and use other apps to track food. I wanted to add 2 tablespoons of cream for my coffee but the app is only giving me cups and ml :(."
"I loved this app for measuring my heart rate and oxygen saturation via my S10 phone sensor. However, since my last phone update the bio sensor on my phone has been deactivated. I tried reinstalling the app and there is no longer an option on the app to the measure. What's the point of an app that doesn't measure anything?"
"The samsung galaxy watch is an amazing watch however, it also gets paired with this app, which shows more detailed running information that I highly value. The last update forces 2FA, which requires a phone number. 2FA has caused numerous issues logging into various accounts of mine and this one is no different. I currently dont have a phone number, which means I cant see the detailed information that the watch can track. I am very disappointed and wont buy another watch until 2FA is removed."
"This app is mediocre on its best day. I don't feel that any information it give you is accurate. I climb several flights off stair daily and it seldom record any. The step count may be 70% accurate, but I don't it. The okay misses my sleep about 80% off the time. I miss my Fitbit."
Why do you need my contacts for me to stay healthy? Surprised I was unable to uninstall. Was blocked access when I denied permission to my calls and my app was rendered useless. I have used this app for years on my weight loss journey. Parting is such sweet sorrow! So sad this relationship has finally come to an end. Now I have to go use the Virgin Pulse app on my iPhone.
"Could you please make a better heart rate summary? For example, it would be beneficial to have the total minutes in each heart zone during exercise for the whole week. The average heart rate per week tells me absolutely nothing. High heart rates could be because of stress or exercise. It would be also beneficial to see the average minutes where I had a high heart rate not related to physical activity. Please use a line plot instead of range plots. Please introduce bar code scanning for food."
"Samsung health app is ok. They need to stwp up there game as to tracking steps, heart rate, challenges. There app has nothing to really offer. Fitbit health tracking is so much better and you can inner act with other people. And see so much more about you steps, heart, sleep, just everything. But fitbit watches suck and would never own one again. Just got this samsung so we will see. Samsung really needs to get up to speed on the health app. Cause this one is dont cut it."
"Nice app, but still I haven't found any supporting app which can download the data from s health in the way it is shown on the screen.  I want to download the data in the form:  Date:       No. of steps walked:            No of steps at healthy pace.   Obviously the data is shown on s health in the same way but the downloading software like data viewer do not download in the same way.   Can you advise for downloading the data of last 5 years in required form.  Kashif"
I used to LOVE this app. Truly it was so useful. However the latest update removed the weight and resting heart rate trends which I was using to track my health improvements weekly and monthly. Now it's only daily. If this doesn't get fixed I'll have to find a new app because I'm not going to manually trend this. Please please add the trends back in!!
"The application is getting crashed continuously in my OnePlus Nord phone device. I've tried everything, clearing caches, reinstalled app multiple times, but nothing worked out. Not even once it opened in my phone. I have purchased Galaxy Watch 4 but can't get the holistic experience. This is very frustrating. I hope I'll get the needed support."
"Have been using this as my go to activity tracker for years and works well with my Gear watch. I use the Running ""pace"" option often and after the last update it disappeared. I searched around to try and find what happened to no avail. Therefore, I posted my displeasure (along with 3 stars.) To my surprise, Samsung support replied the next day and after looking in the Community, I found out that it was moved under a new Running Coach section. I'm fully back up and running; 5 stars it is."
Dear samsung Kindly please add ECG and BLOOD PRESSURE feature for non Samsung devices It's been a great watch overall than any other watch I have used but the key features are not there which is ECG and BLOOD PRESSURE kindly please bring that features to the non Samsung devices . I Hope you will bring this features unlocked for non Samsung users throught an update. Thank you üòä
"The app itself is easy to use and has decent diet tracking features. The step tracking and activity tracking is really spotty. There is a 5.5 mile stretch of road that I walk and sometimes run. Fitbit, and other fitness trackers show about 11,500 steps. SHealth also shows this, 3 out of 6 times that is. There is nothing worse than being excited to see your progress then have that excitement killed from you when it only recored 3k steps."
"Used to love the app and use it daily. However, like many others I aren't happy that the app now requires access to my contacts to even open. I've seen the responses by Samsung to previous 1 star reviews about this update which have been disappointing copy and pastes about the app requiring access to contacts for optimisation, however I aren't sure how Samsung being able to access my mum's phone number helps with optomisation?? Samsung?? Any answers to that one please? Thanks."
"This is my second attempt to get the pedometer to measure accurately. I just walked a 2 mile course that I walk regularly. The pedometer measures 1.3 miles. Why bother if the pedometer had a 35% failure rate? *** Thanks for responding, but I checked the app at the beginning of my walk and it was functioning well, so how am I to know that I need to take these 7 steps? Is this necessary before every walk? If so, why doesn't the app tell me that I need to?"
"I used this app on my older phone and tried to sign in on my new phone. After being sent a code to verify it is me, I was unable to use a keyboard that has both letters and numbers. The stupid keyboard can only be used to type in numbers, so I can't verify it is me and get back into the app. This is so fustrating!"
"It would gain one star each for these following features. 1. Give me the option to change my ""day"". Not all of us work 9-5 jobs and it ruins all the tracking when everything resets at midnight. 2. Give back the watch widget for calories burned."
Used to work perfectly. Now absolute garbage. Does not properly sync with my Galaxy Watch and no longer picks up readings from my Renpho Smart scales. No broken links or permission errors. This app is now totally useless to me.
"Bring back the weight management function! Seriously, why would you remove the KEY function of a health and fitness app. The ability to measure calorie intake against calorie burn and set levels for weight loss. This must have been signed off by change management. I want to see the documented reasoning as to why this simple function was removed. Edit. A US number for support? Really? Obviously don't care as EVERY response from Samsung has been one of three proformas. Awful Customer care."
Great application and features. But is it possible to add a feature where we can scan the barcode for Food using our camera. Other health applications have this feature. Also a food tracking widget will be useful.
I used to love this app however now it's growing tiresome to have. I used it for the weight management widget that was removed a few months ago in an update. I continue to keep inputting my daily calories hoping the widget will reappear to no avail. Please developers of this app bring it back in the next update. Look at the Samsung community forum. You have several unhappy users wanting this to return.
"Well this app saved my life last year because of the blood oxygen sensor and heat rate monitor it showed that I needed to go to the hospital so I did. Now that the feature is gone or not working when I needed it,it didn't work wow how can you get rid of something so great. I'm a big galaxy fan now your making me want to change to IOS which I dislike greatly please get it working again it helped a lot of people not only me."
I used this app daily for the weight management option to track my calories consumed and burned. Then it updated and now that option is gone. Was told to check back to see if feature comes back. 12/21/2020 UPDATE: I went from using this app everyday to now never using it and shopping for a new phone. Samsung really deleted one of the best features of having samsung devices. Now it's just worthless to me and makes me wish I had got an iphone
"This is a great app, except for one thing. The app will report I've burned through over 1,000 calories so far that day, I eat a meal of less than 400 calories, and the app days I'm ""over"" my calories for that point in the day. Which is bullcrap. As a person who struggled with eating disorders in her youth, this feature is disturbing. It shouldn't say my food is over unless it exceeds the calories burned. In what world is a 390 calorie meal 70 calories ""too much"" after a 1k burn???"
"First with Galaxy S20, they removed oximeter functionally. Now,, After recent updates, this app has removed heart and stress monitoring features. This app is becoming a dud app. If this continues, there is no need for me to keep this app. When I go to the Contact us page, all I see is FAQ, community, Error Reports, Remote Support. What do you want me to do? You keep sending me emails, but no real way to contact you. SAD state of affairs."
"Hmm liked at first, now not so much. Main problem is that you cannot remove the foods you just do not need and many which are duplicated. I entered my own and made an error in one setting, cant go back in to adjust. Step counter is iffy to say the least. Looking for an alternative one now. It is a shame but needs must."
Was accurate when I had my S5 but since going to the S20FE the step counter only records maybe 20 percent of my steps. Dev suggested cleaning cache storage for app. I went to extreme and Uninstaller then installed after which it restored my data. Since doing this the accuracy is much better.
"Not happy with the new permissions requirements that go too far in my humble opinion. There is absolutely no reason this app should need to make calls. Unless this changes, i will be deleting and finding an alternative to what's has until now, been a great app. Very unhappy indeed. I do not accept your reply. There is absolutely no reason this app would ever need to make a call. Your explanation does not explain this to my satisfaction."
Samsung removed the measurement functionality. Used to be useful. Now it is just a waste of space. I am sure they have someone with a very clever justification for doing so. I am also sure that they would do the world a service by having an iron bar driven through their skull.
"I use to use this app everyday for many reasons, from recording my steps to seeing how my weight was going. After an auto update it now wants to have permission for access to parts of my phone that I do not want to give access to. Unless I do, then I can't use the app. Well congrats Samsung, you have just lost me using your app as I am now uninstalling it and you have just lost me from ever buying a Samsung phone again. Bully someone else with the do what I want or else routine. Edit: uninstall"
"It's good but today my phone got an update so I updated it and then after it was done updating, the samsung health app kept showing the loading icon and under it its just ""updating"" and the icon of the app doesn't even show in my widget, idk how to fix this :/ it's been showing that for hours"
"It would be nice if the food recording section was easier, able to scan bar codes for automatic entry, and if the app calculated your remaining calories based on food intake and exercise output. More like fitbit"
Very upset that I cannot use all the features because they took off the sensor feature. I do not want to purchase a watch. As an asthmatic it was an inportant feature for me.
"The app was brilliant till the ""Weight Control"" feature was removed with the new update (5th August). Is there a way to uninstall the latest update and use to the older version until this is fixed? The new version of S Health is quite useless for me at the moment and I won't be using the app if I'm stuck with the new version."
"I'm not sure if this app is legit or a scam. There's no reason why the app needs access to make phone calls. They say it's for a service called ""Together"" but I don't need it and I don't know what it is."
"I shouldn't have to call, I don't want to listen to excuses - tech savvy people need to just make an option for people who work night shift (our midnight is what noon normally is) to select so tracking is more accurate & I don't have to do as much (read: any extra) calculations. How is it not an option in this day and age??"
Alright app though the giant banner ad at the top is annoying and the app desperately needs a dark mode/theme. It also sometimes breaks my workouts up at random spots instead of recording it all as one workout like it should.
I like that it has most of the stuff I want to track and its so easy to use. Its frustrating that when you add a drink in the food section it does NOT reflect in the caffeine section or water section. Also that you can NOT enter the actual amount of caffeine just how many 80 mg cups of caffeine you had. Not all drinks have the same amount of caffeine! Update: Noticing other issues now...
"I made a review recently and was told to call a number regarding my issue with the app, I honestly don't need to call the cause I am not in US. It is directing me to create Samsung account and when I try to do it it does not recognize phone prefix +383 if this could be fixed I would appreciate it and if not? I'll just use another app that doesn't require this much."
"Edit 20220310: Cannot delete/edit individual sleep cycles during the same day. Nor edit workouts. 2018: The best workout/fitness app out there!üí™üôè The only thing I miss is the ability to manage the account and workouts via a webpage. When, and if, that happens, I'll surely ditch Endomondo Sports Tracker."
"Two step verification? Why? It is so irritating that you can not use health app without setting up two factory verification. Health data safe? Why step counting records needs to be secure that you are forcing user to setup TFA. It should be optional. You could simply add a fingerprint also to make it easier. Disabling this app. Idiotic move. Besides this, for all your apps, stop forcing user to update to use. When we need it urgen, we are asked to update otherwise out. Why the hell?"
Very good and all tools are working as expected. Only issue I see is the new update has daily activities/calendar view steps total is set as mins active by mistake. Easy fix though. Maybe add graphing function to analyze data would be nice! Thanks!
"Oxygen Level? Heart rate? Cannot find the claimed oxygen saturation anywhere on the app once I upgraded my phone and uploaded the latest version. Truly frustrating. Steps, heart rate, and oxygen levels are the 3 primary reasons I used this app. Now it's basically useless to me. UPDATE: So in your response you acknowledge that you're claiming the app provides OXYGEN SATURATION and HEART RATE readings while fully knowing that it doesn't???"
"Wow. Use to use this app before to track my HR, decided to re-try this app. Its like they put the least intuitive person in charge of creating the worst UI and function. Literally it's a giant leap back in function and assistance. Uninstalling again. Seriously...This is the best you could do Samsung?"
"So I decided to start a fitness program and signed up to the 10k one. I soon realised that it doesn't work when using a treadmill and constantly (and I mean every 30 seconds) moans at you that Im not doing the right pace, which clearly I am because I'm on a treadmill which controls the pace. I got so sick of it telling me to speed up then slow down I quit the program. My first and last experience of a Samsung fitness program I'm afraid."
Not counting steps automatically in my s21 Fe. Was working fine in Nokia 6.1plus. What an irony?
Hallo Samsung I am Enjoying you're app very much. It helped me to try to get to my goals everyday but.. the problem is I don't always have my phone with me so the app can get my steps and Active time. I'm getting the Fitbit Charge 3 and I am not finding the Fitbit App in the in the Supported apps list and I want to know why? But except for that the app is very Good. I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a fitness app. Thank you for your good apps and service!!
"Terrible compared to Garmin software. This is unintuitive like no other app. How do i check on my phone for steps, sleep and other features? I can find how charges the battery is and change the watch face. This is absolutely a nightmare to connect to my phone in comparison to the Garmin and it ost twice as much. You need to make this much simpler Samsung. By the way, I still have no idea how to get data from you pathetic watch4 onto this app, if it is even possible? Or do you use another app???"
This was all good until the latest update where they took off the weight management. This was very useful to keep a target of the weight and be in control. Please have this feature back
Why is a health app taking away health related parts. And the caffeine counter... I use that every day just like the water counter. It's a very simple application why take it away?! Update: This is ridiculous! There is no reason a health app needs contact permissions just to open the app! And your generic answer is stupid and is giving no one really reason to trust. This app needs to just go back like a year in updates and stop messing with it!! The changes unnecessarily it was fine as it was!
"This app keeps me focused on staying active, which I really need. However, sometimes i notice that it misses over 1k steps, for example the whole way home from picking up the kids from school, and it would be in my pocket, where it counted my whole walk to the school, so then I am officially cheated out of steps I definitely did!"
"I have bought a Samsung band to become heathier and to use the health features for this and I have followed all the instructions. I can sign into this app but once I signed in, it just loads and that's it. I tried this over 2 days now and it keeps doing the same! It's so frustrating as this was the sole reason why I bought the band!!! May have to return it now due to the sole reason of this app not working!"
"Why has the oxygen meter been removed?? Used to love this app and use it all the time but not so much anymore, bought the watch because of this but now that's useless too!!! I have oxygen issues and have to constantly check my levels it was so much easier to do it with my phone... really wish you would bring that back!!!"
Not sure what is going on but I purchased a new phone and now I do not have the spo2 or heart rate monitor in the app....I absolutely loved the app prior to this change. Please tell me that you didn't remove the functions from within and I just need to change something on my phone. Thanks in advance .
"Everything was fine before this new update. Now it's a huge pain to even sign in. I had to go through a half hour of nonsense just so I could look at how many steps I did today, and it still didnt let me in. I had to delete that update just for me to access this app. Please get rid of the update, it was doing just fine without it."
My first review was deleted. Can't use the app because I had rooted my device previously. So what! I can understand if you stop me from using Samsung pass or pay but health app? I paid for this device should be able to do whatever I want. This needs to stop. We paimy money for these stupid phone and you control us what we can and can't do. I was about to buy Samsung watch guess what it won't sync with my phone app.
I dont like that my walking time starts going down it's only because I play basketball all day instead of walking and I'm not bouta carry my phone around so yeah but it has everything I'm looking for and everything is pretty easy to find and get used to it's not confusing what things are or where they are so if you want something to count your steps and do fun challenges with at the same time and some more things like keep track of your food and water and sleep and more then get Samsung Health
"Had to write a review again. I used to love this app, now only thing I'm using it for is to measure the heart rate and oxygen. Woke up this morning and it told me I'm already 442 calories over my limit üòÇ when I've not entered any info yet. So inaccurate. Cant enter any exercise manually. Total waste of time. Google fit is way better üëå"
I love using this app however I've noticed that the step counter and calories burned is not working properly. I've already read and did the step I saw in a previous comment from someone else having the same problem. It showed that literally from my bedroom to my livingroom that it was 35 steps and I've burned 385 calories. Which that distance is less than 35 steps.
"I used to love the app until you started requesting permission to access my phone calls. What??? Why??? I also read replies to others that have the same problem. You state that the information isn't used or shared with anyone. So, why do you need access to it?? I will not grant permission for this! There is no need for you to have permission to access my contacts and phone calls. You just need to know my location and body sensors to track the walking. Please fix app to way it was."
"So far, I love this app. Would like to make a suggestion, though. When it comes to adding water, tea and coffee, I know several people that drink more than the 8 oz of water at a time, and log it all at once. The coffee and tea doesn't give any amounts at all. Can this be changed so we can enter our own amounts instead of what the app shows?"
"A strong one star. The developers have removed features I consider critical including the ability to view weight and heart rate trends over weeks and months. The permissions are now very intrusive, despite the auto response this review will get there is no acceptable reason why Samsung insists on two Factor authentication when I do not. Finally, like all other Samsung apps the ads are intrusive. I've set my app to not update as every update in the last 18 months has made it worse."
"I've used this app for years. Now it wants phone permissions before I can continue using it again. Guess I'm not using it until this is no longer a required permission. I realize this is needed for CERTAIN functionality, but it shouldn't stop me from using basic features like step counting reviews. The way the app is designed right now doesn't let your continue at all. Disappointing"
"What have you done, Samsung? I was perfectly happy with the weight data and fat % element due to average monthly tracking based on daily recordings, which has helped me drop weight and fat % and maintain a healthy profile over a long period of time. Now I can only see my daily weight tracked. I am now looking elsewhere, please restore this chart. This feature was key to my health."
"For last 4 days daily step count has not been stored into ""trends"" at the end of day. Phone is Samsung A50. Have tried everything. Clear cache, reinstall app, etc,etc. Update: You have sent response which is obviously automatic standard response as I have tried everything you suggest. I told you this in my original enquiry above. Also trying to ring a US number and no response is useless from Australia. Just fix the app."
Easy to use . Easy to find stats. Recommended and it's informative
"After 5 years I just uninstalled this app. I updated it yesterday and haven't been able to open the app since. It asks to verify my phone number, I click ok and it goes right back to asking for 2 step verification. 5 years of data lost, thanks for ruining a good app...bye......your stock answer does no good when I enter my phone number it boots me back to the previous page..I can't sign in! Do you not understand all these complaints lately? Your update screwed up your app, fix it on your end!"
"I used this for heart rate and O2-sat in the past, but now I can't even use the hardware my phone is equipped with. If Samsung thinks I'm going to go buy their watch and give them more money for double the hardware, then they can... (insert explitive). I'll be buying a non-Samsung product for that very reason, maybe even switch to Apple so I don't feel like I'm paying double in the future. Geez Samsung, it's not like you own the heart monitoring market where I have to come crawling back to you."
"I used to app mainly for running. This app used to be my go to for 2 years. I loved this app but with the recent update, all the running programs and the speed notifications that the app had, are all gone. It's just garbage now. I'll probably uninstall and switch to another app"
"I love this app. Deep offerings for exercise, relaxation and sleep. I am fitter than I was a year ago when I started. I walked every day during the early datk Covid-19 days. Moving and exercising kept my spirits up. The challenges are attainable. I have found it to be reliable. A big thank you to the app developers from me. I am very grateful for your efforts."
"Old version can add friends by their Samsung account. New version only can add by QR code or invite. Can we have the add by Samsung account back. I can't add new friends now. Also we should be able to set up our own group challenge from friends, not just one friend at one time. Under add friends, I only want to see friends ""activity at your level"", how to do that."
Samsung F-ing up anything good left in terms up apps now. Constantly updating terms of service. And now forcing us to use 2 factor authentication. I just want to use the app not bother with these nonsense. Edit after response: first of all app should work without any account whatsoever. Instead you force us to use an account and two factor authentication. And we can't use any other app. I'd give zero star if I could.
"App marred by advertisements. It actually has potential but it is marred by the tacky inclusion of rotating advertisements which sit at the top of the screen. you cannot disable the advertisements. this seems beneath such an app for such a company. it really dissuades my use of the app and therefore it gets a much lower rating. for this reason I use my Garmin watch with Garmin connect much more now. Please, simply remove unwanted advertisements from apps that are part of the core of Samsung."
App is giving inaccurate activity readings since update
"Constant updates. Phone vibrates to tell me it's updating, this has happened at least 50 times in less than 24 hours, sure it has been more than that whilst i slept. When it's updating my phone wont let me do anything on it. The 'updates' are continuing, on the play store there are no updates for the app, yet it has been updating for the last 2 days??? Appreciatiate the concern Samsung and the number to call you on but i can't because the updates stop me doing anything on my phone!"
"Hi there, I have always liked Samsung Health as it helps me to mainly track my steps. However, it stopped tracking since a few days ago and it still didnt work after I updated the application or even the phone. I have also tried to clear the cache too. I am currently using an S8. Please help to advise. Thank you!"
"I have used and loved this app for years and have recommended it to friends all that time. after the most recent update (April 2021) it will not open and run. I have agreed to the new privacy statement, granted more permissions than I wanted and it will not allow me to use it. From 5 stars to none in one update!"
"I love love this app! It works so flawlessly with my Fit2. It keeps track of my food, sleep and stress. It has so many amazing programs from fitness partners. I have subscribed to over 5 workout regiments and they've thought me so much about gym, and the proper way of using the equipment. This is the ONLY fitness app you need. Thank you so much Samsung, this knocks it out the park."
"Hi, recently I changed my mobile to Note 10+. Generally, when I am walking it gives me correct step counts, however, when I am skipping or running on the spot the steps count is very erratic. It record very less steps count. I don't understand whether the problem is with the APP or mobile set. Regards"
"Works well on phone with my GWatch4 Classic (though aggravating how many features are still turned off in US). Want to review data on larger screen, but no web access, and especially odd: incompatible with my Samsung S7+ tablet"
"Been using various of health tracking app before. Can't deny the UI for this app is absolutely beautiful. However, the features still not that good enough compare to other health app on market. Can't make a full review here, but surely this app STILL need a major tuning before we can rely 100% on this app. 3 stars is the best I can rate for as for now. Will continue to use for a couple of month."
"beware of this fake app. Samsung Health app is a great tool for people to use challenge themselves and others to take control of the daily activities. Thus, what bother me so much of the fake stuff on this app. On day 3 of the challenge, 111 people are completed 200K steps, two of those top ten are the same person. i have the screen to show it. i dont know if i can add picture to this review. Sorry @Samsunghealth, you need to fix this fake app."
"Samsung had been producing software for a while - I'm surprised they have so much difficulty with security. First I have issues with their Wear app, and now Samsung Health is dealing some grief. I start the app and press ""Agree"". I am then told ""Can't set up app. Samsung account session expired. Sign in to Samsung account again."". Then I press the OK Button and the App exits. Hey Samsung... How can I sign in to my account again if you don't give me a way to sign in?"
"No idea why a health app would need permission to make phone calls to work. Also confusing that I need to verify my account, but the ""verify"" button doesn't work. What I need is to know how many steps I walked today but that is impossible to find out thanks to an update I was forced to get. Absolutely destroyed my ability to even use the app."
"Not too great. It should allow to connect all accessories rather just Samsung. Also the home screen widgets keeps failing. Step counts are more so based on weight, height and not on actual steps."
"I use Samsung Health to track BP, weight, and workouts. I would like to be able to track weight training workouts. Currently, the app tracks workouts by time. I want to be able to track weight training workouts by: exercise, sets, reps, and weight (and possibly equipment type) Now that we're in the midst of a pandemic, you can add temperature checks to the list on health items to track. If possible add a temperature scanner to the phone. Overall I'm very satisfied with the Samsung Health app."
"I am writing this here because I cannot find a way to ask a question. I recently traded my Fitbit for a Samsung Gear Fit2 Pro (I LOVE it!) I am using the app on my phone, but I REALLY miss the 'dashboard' that Fitbit made available online so that I could monitor and enter information online rather than on my phone. Is this a feature you might add in the future? Not a fan of My Fitness Pal, but they DO offer this feature. I don't want to switch if I don't have to..."
"I had to download a version from September of '20 to get it to work on my Blackberry but im very pleased w/ the SAMSUNG HEALTH APP, i wonder if i update it to the most current version i will be back to square ONE, STUCK on the sign in loading page?.. Not sure if i should, or not?! 8th Feb, '21 update: thank you for responding, i followed your instructions and all has been fine, thank you for the response!!!"
"I have a s10+ and I could not get into. Kept denying it. All I wanted to do was count my steps and go walking with my husband. Now, I cant do that because I can't get passed the error screen and message: ""later"" or ""retry"". When I do ""retry"", still sends me to and error message. My husband and I have the same phone. His works but mine does not. Not to pleased right now."
"The last update is not good for the graphs of weight as the y axis is much larger than +/- 5 lbs, as such we barely see any changes in weight. Please return it to what it was."
The app is broken I have sent numerous feedback to fix it and no response so far. I can't even use my phone properly because the app notification keeps popping up every minute now. Can someone fix this. I used to love this app but since last year it has been broken on my phone üì±. Kristine
"Upgrades are not always improvements unfortunately. Any way you can review the extra steps you put in to record food? Having to select what meal type you're having first and the scrolling time before completing the entry has added steps to the process. I also liked to use this as a planning tool for tomorrow's meals, but now I cannot enter anything for the future."
"I have a Samsung S8 phone with Verizon as my carrier. Samsung's Health has been working fine until yesterday. Yesterday, May 29, 2019, a message kept coming up that to protect my security, Samsung Health cannot be opened on a rooted phone.  My phone has not been rooted. Is this a bug or is there something else going on?"
"New update now requires you to have 2 Authentication and permissions to access phone. Didnt want to but gave in to find you need to have an account now. To just take your heart rate I now HAVE to have an account. Refuse to create an account. Every company has to collect data for ""user experience"" is getting out of hand. Uninstalled. Update: I will not give access to my phone. Time to start looking for a new phone now since I can't use all of the features/hardware I paid for without an account."
was great with my Galaxy s9 plus put on any other Android device it seems to come up in a different language not detecting the proper location or just doesn't open at all can't sign in as it doesn't recognize my information and basically this app is useless unless you have a Galaxy device as far as I can tell.
very quick response from the tech support üòÅ When are you going to add the blood pressure functionality to the app and watch 4?
"I just love this app it helps me track my meals and Excersize and I like the challenges and workouts offered. Just needs one thing to add more in the food options that are not branded, to fit all regions and countries."
Been using this app for years and loved it. Now I can't use it until I give you control of my phone and contacts? The app will be deleted. Never again. Maybe time for a new brand of phone also!! I see your response and it does not change anything I said. I stand by my original comments. You folks just don't get it. Time to move on from Samsung!!!
i wish there was a place to store body measurements to track these as I loose weight. I really love this app and it has helped me become healthier. Update 6/23/2021 Like everyone else I am not giving you permission to manage phone calls. That's why we get scamming phone calls from actual phone numbers. You ruined your own app.
Not very good. No option to set levels of intensity when exercising so showed calories burnt as way higher then they should have been. Also when paired with mfp it shows remaining calories as something like -3400 when I've literally fasted for 18 hours.
"love the app but I've forgotten my password there doesn't seem to be any rescue for my password says reset and all data will be lost absolutely gutted my history is my motivation. is there anyway of resolving this I really don't want to loose my history on the app. I feel broken üò≠ Thank you for the e-mail but the email you've asked me to contact you on says no reply email. I'm still hoping the reset can be resolved, in the mean time I've downloaded another app tracker but I prefer Samsung."
Why in the world are you serving ads in this app with no opt-out feature? This is ridiculous. You have to use this godforsaken app to use galaxy wearables and they serve ads that one can't opt out of. Samsung is going to dogs with their shortsightedness and annoying users. Update: You guys removed the annoying banner ads for a bit and I was glad it was probably moving in the right direction and then this last update now comes with bigger banner ads??? Ugh
Interesting that I posted a review this morning and just received a notification that the developer responded only to come here and find my review was removed. My 1 star rating is mostly for that. Honestly though aside from a step counter I don't find this app to be very useful. It used to have a heart rate monitor feature. Not sure why that is no longer a feature. Had to go get a separate app for that. Useless. Don't delete my review this time and maybe I'll bring it back up to where it was.
"Moderate until privacy issues. After reading many reviews below and seeing no acceptable reply. Samsung is requiring permissions to use the app that there is no good reason to require. ""Optimal experience"" is just avoiding the answer. I will be removing the app today. I have used Samsung phones and products for years. But my future replacements will not be Samsung."
"so 3 stars, not for the app (haven't actually used it so don't have an opinion one way or another) but a couple more stars for customer service and responding to my earlier message. lot of times there's no response and you feel as if you're just talking into the void, so thanks to the samsung team for at least taking time to respond."
"I do enjoy the app but the global challenges are stupid if Samsung continues to let Bots win. it's not hard to write a quick script to ban the bots so normal people can get a decent ranking. Also, there should be an option to change your health goal when you are pregnant. Again, not rocket science. It could be done easily amongst Samsung programmers. UPDATE: 2 Yrs on and still no major improvement. Bots still doing millions of steps each day. Hate to say, but Apple watch is streets ahead."
"App is good, however on stress testing and not sure if it works well. No matter what mood I'm in levels are always the same. They also need more options for mood descriptions."
"Ok, and have to use it as one of the few options to sync with vitality but not as good as wahoo or garmin or strava apps. Won't sync non GPS activity with Strava. Why? Can't get the help link in the app to work so that is no use and Samsung support on twitter told me this was intended."
"Samsung Health app is pretty good. But Samsung global challenge is heaven for cheaters. Though I didn't noticed for first 3-4 months; but there is cheating happened by participants. For example, in month of april 2020 person at 1st position has recorded 2877000 steps, = to 2055 kms in month / = to 68 kms a day. Which is impossible. When I Google this problem, it is prevalent since 2017. So even after 3 years, condition is same. This is very bad Samsung. 1 star reduced for same pathetic status."
"(Please Read - Samsung update) As a consumer... I am sick and tired of advertising! Give us the option for advertising or have an option to purchase the app. I bought the Samung phone and the watch, isn't $1,400.00 enough? Now you want to force me to watch advertising I don't want. When is it enough? When does society say NO MORE! (Update - Sep 29, Samsung says to call a number, but they are sorry, they don't know why I would call since there is nothing they can do. Seems their replies a scam!!)"
"I don't know how you've done it, but the update made the app even worse. functionality is down, sleep tracking doesn't work, and the app keeps freezing for the past week everytime on the s20."
Why did you remove the weight management??? My whole family used and loved this app. Why would you remove the functions that made this app a weightloss app??? It made even the samsung watches pointless since you can no longer use the activity to see if you're on target... Or if you have to step up your activity. Who ever thought that it was a good idea to remove the most popular and useful functions should be fired. Bring them back.
"Why does a health app need to ""manage"" my phone calls? Uninstalled immediately. Absolutely no reason I can think of that I would ever need a health app to manage my phone calls. Garbage. Edit: to the dev response, it's not used for anything else YET. It'll get slipped in the next ToS that everyone just accepts. Not many new tricks in privacy invasion."
"Unable to sign in as the confirmation code sent from Samsung takes longer than the 9 minutes maximum they allow for entering it, so how do I register if the app does not give enough time?? Tried again and this time the code took 19 hours to come into my phone, how do I register when the app still gives a maximum of 9 minutes?? Finally gave up trying to sign into the app, it's just not possible, so what used to be a useful device is now a watch. Will purchase a non Samsung one now.."
"2-step authentication? seriously? couldn't you just ask if I needed it at all. I don't. I'd rather find another app. would you please tell me if there's a way to turn it off? PS stop updating the app. it's getting worse every time. Upd apr.19: are you saying that the app won't work without 2-step authentication? if so, I won't use it at all. pity. I liked it."
"Broken after android update. Fails to sync and most things in the app are loading indefinitely. Edit: your suggestion did not help, but reinstalling the app did. This is the second time the app breaks for me."
Not being able to edit a workout is ridiculous. Having the sleep monitor break your sleep into separate sessions if you get up and walk to the bathroom is also absurd. This app needs a lot of work to be more useful. Do the people who make it actually use it?
"Cant even logon, what a joke this app is! Been trying to logon every day for 5 days just to get online for the first time. All I get is the never ending loading wheel which just goes on and on. All I can say is I hope samsung pull their finger out and sort this out. Reading the other reviews it's quite clear there are ongoing issues."
"My daily activity stopped working, I cannot see what I did yesterday. Please respond!"
"With the latest update, I can no longer clear notifications. This is a ridiculous change. Reading other reviews tells me others are having the same issue. Don't tell me to call you to discuss the problem. You know the problem and need to provide the solution without me having to take unnecessary steps. I'll consider reinstalling if it's fixed soon."
"Keeps shutting down on smart watch, does not sync steps, heart rate etc on smart watch 4, phone app works to a certain extent, dosn't show deep sleep pattern since updated, all round it wound be nice to view readings on my watch instead of having to open phone app all the time."
"Up until today when I upgraded my phone and aps all had to reinstall I would have given this one 5 stars. They have yet again removed the blood oxygen, heart rate. Stress, sensor. Due to my health conditions. I used these daily and tracked changes! I guess it is all about money and selling more junk that has to hook up, attach, or pair with our already overloaded devices."
"Okay until the latest privacy update. I hate it when apps ask for unnecessary permissions! The app is now disabled on my phone until you reverse this or explain exactly what new ""features"" need to make and access my phone calls. You might think its optimal, I don't and you removed my ability to decide what info I share. Shame. I liked it otherwise."
Are you guys not listening to your customers?!?! Bueller? Bueller? Bueller?Was so happy to see an update after 2 months since the last awful update they did. Why on earth would you remove the weight management option?! I kept seeing the replies for the wait for the next update and finally it is here...que the wha wha wha music. You did nothing to help this app. Man I wish there was a way to give it 0 stars. Bring back weight management!!! It helped me lose 120lbs!!!
"Edit: It seems that samsung app is going to be sold or replaced. They are actively closing functions on the app. Be aware before buying samsung accessories in near futrue. I would wait to see what happens with the health app first. Old: New update asks me to agree to ""optional"" consent to share my health data with third parties. Why is it stated as ""optional choice"" when disagreeing means you have to uninstall the app? It shouldn't be named optional when you have only one choice for continuing!"
Not very accurate in recording sleep. Hours/minutes don't quite add up to the graph. Have to restart the app to get correct readings. Suspect that the pulse readings are off as well.
"Loved this until the most recent update, now it doesn't work at all and will not sync with my Samsung watch. Very disappointed, lots of others seem to be having the same problem. Hoping it will be rectified soon."
"Not happy with the fact that when I try the Baby Steps to 5K program, the app doesn't count your run unless you're outside. Cannot get credit for the day's run on a treadmill so since it is raining out, I have to miss my workout. That's not cool. Please fix this or please let me know how to get around this issue. Thanks!"
Not even worth a point on a star. Why have the permissions changed to want access to my contacts and phone calls. Breach of the Australian Privacy Act. Sadly it becoming all too common with Samsung developed apps. Same for the app to control my Samsung Smart Air-conditioning unit. Based on Samsung's response it still makes absolutely no sense to give these permissions. Everyone hates the change so just removal this stupid request. Maybe time for everyone to uninstall the app for another
This app has saved my life for real 3 separate times. I have bad asthma and it let me know in time to go to the hospital because of this app I can't look at another phone. Also I sell phones and I show this app as a selling point to my customers. I am shocked Apple hasn't have a similar app. Measuring my oxygen levels is great plus it help me lose 63 kgs in 10 months. Awesome app I highly recommend this app
"The built in heartrate measure is now useless on your samsung phone. For whatever reason they have decided after many years to rug the use of a part of the phone. This could definitely make me switch from samsung, I loved using this feature for my health."
"I loved this app until I upgraded my phone to the Samsung 22 and it didn't come on the new phone unless you have the watch. On my Samsung S10 the camera would measurement the heart rate & oxygen levels with me placing my finger over the camera lens. If they can add it back so you can measure, on to the Samsung S22 to this without the watch that will be great. If I would of know it wasn't going to be part of the new phone I would of not purchased the Samsung S22 phone. Newer isn't always better."
"Filled with Ad's since last update. The stress tracker now shows ""related content"" which is nothing but advertising. Heart rate graph is terrible. Go back to the original way of showing heart rate across time. Not this vertical view."
"App keeps crashing on launch with error Can't setup app ""server error occurred try again later (0x2c#7#524288)"" on my Samsung m31 phone"
"Used to like this until they changed their policy. Can ANYONE tell me why this app REQUIRES permission to make and receive phone calls in order to function? If anyone can explain this to me maybe I'll start using it again. Apparently, updating my review didn't get their attention, so I deleted it and I'll try again. I'll make it simple. Explain. To. Me. WHY. It. Needs. Permission. To. Make. Calls."
"Privacy Fail. This app essentially requires you to share a portion of your personal health information with any of your contacts who also have Samsung Health. And it uses your phone number and contact list to do so. Who really wants their boss, their ex, and their random friend from five years ago to have access to private health information? Thanks but no thanks."
"I used this app for over a year really liked it. I had all my food and calories in it not to mention blood sugar, sleep, steps, water, ect. Then yesterday it does an update and now wants me to sign in. I never did at all so now I have lost everything I have lost weight and now I have lost all my progress. I have emailed them and have heard nothing. I am so heartbroken I think this really sucks. I will not recommend this to anyone else now"
I have tried so many times to use this app but it keep saying Unauthorized changes happen on my phone. I have checked all setting and Apps i seem not to understand what the changes is. And i have even updated to the latest version.
"Why does the update need access to my contacts, photos and other things that don't concern you? It's a NO for me. I uninstalled and will use another app. AND I DO NOT CARE IF SAMSUNG DOESNT SHARE OR USE MY PERMISSIONS!! You should not NEED my contacts and files to use the health app especially if you have a SAMSUNG devise!! Why are you all making things so difficult to use? This is such BS! I just added another app and it asked for NONE of what Samsung Health did. Interesting."
"this app used to work for me, I needed to gain weight after an illness I had last year. This app allowed me to keep an eye on my calorie intake and nutritional intake to put 20lbs back on my body. it actually worked well. now I want to put on 15 more lbs, preferably muscle mass. But the app is too unstable and is crashing, glitches too.I had to uninstall the app. Someone please look into this problem, I have the Samsung s8 if that helps."
I had been a user of Samsung Health and Samsung in general for years. After they updated the two-step verification where we needed to give them our phone numbers in order to get to use the apps the violation to the users privacy started. I never accepted. Now they're going a step further with this last update April 2021. I can't even sign in without my number. I read the privacy notice and it's clearly stated: 'We may share your info to third parties'. My next phone and gears wont b Samsung
"Was great until they updated their ""privacy"" policy demanding the app be allowed to make and manage phone calls. Er, no, no way on God's green earth does this app require that permission, nor is it gettingthat permissionfrom me. Very unfortunate that they have gone down this route. I won't be using it again unless they remove this. And Samsung are just copy pasting their generic reply to everyone instead of taking note that NO ONE WANTS THIS! I uninstalled the app."
Doesn't pick up very many of my steps. I walked from 5 a.m. to 7 a.m. around my house doing things and it said I had zero steps in ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è how do I fix the sensitivity on the app?
keeps saying I've rooted my phone. I'm quite insulted that you think I would do something illegal. will be speaking to a solicitor. Reply to your reply. No I'm not ringing a foreign number I live in the uk. I have tried rebooting I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling nothing works. It's obvious from other reviews that this is an issue with a number of phones. Samsung have gone down in quality over the last couple of models. I wont be getting another one.
"It's pretty good. I rarely take my phone with me on walks, so it always says I barely took any steps today, but that is my fault not the app's. If you take your phone with you on walks or runs, this would be perfect. The only concern is that you can simply shake your phone and it will count as steps, so the step count may not be the most accurate."
Distance measurement is always incorrect
"Did an update on this app now it won't see my band. Also it wants me to sign onto the program and when I do that, it will never get into the program. That also means that I have the internet turned so that I can try to get into this software and I donot leave my internet on The update sucks so not load it . I no longer have this on my phone since I cannot use it.I am just going to buy a new band and it will not be anything that is samsung based"
"Something wrong with the apps. Usually it took 48-49,5km my regulary route on cycling, and now i took longer route that also pass through my regular route but it just cut my range around 8-10km. ü§î i would use the previous-previous version of the app if i could, the distance was right and i get information every km. üò£ i count in gmaps its should be around 53km, my leg dont lie and more hurt to see the result. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è yesterday was 35km and today 40km. üò≠"
Very buggy. Steps and calories never listed as the same on gear watch and this app despite repeated reinstalls. I would love any other app but this is the only one that links... sort of... with the watch. Now has annoying ad on home page... an added insult.
"I just discovered yesterday after years of use that it you have a heart rate monitor and let's say choose a category for your working out, for example weight machines, your heart rate doesn't matter. The app will always say you burned the same amount of calories depending on the type of workout you choose. This has encouraged me to switch to something else that actually guages me accurately"
"Not counting steps Worked fine up until recently when I just noticed it hasn't been counting any of my steps for the past couple weeks, not a single one no steps counted at all and this is also playing up at the same time as my Samsung Pay has stopped working which left me stood awkwardly in the shop after forgetting to bring my card I thought ""oh it's fine I'll just use my phone"" I pulled my phone out and swiped up to access my Samsung Pay and nothing, searched for the app and it doesn't work"
"[2] Samsung Health Monitor App and ECG Feature are available only on Galaxy Watch3 and Galaxy Watch Active2 when paired with Samsung Galaxy phones with Android N or above. So, how do I get a refund on this worthless watch? I don't have a Samsung phone but bought the watch for this feature alone. I have been waiting patiently for almost a year only to find this out today. Folks, do not buy this watch unless you buy a Samsung phone too because it will not work as advertised!"
The feedback on daily reads is just too cluttered. We need to be able to expand or landscape. Also need to see heart rate built into the sleep cycle. Its just too hard to digest as it is now. Very unfortunate.
"I have been using this app for five years without any problem. However, today I bought a new samsung phone and I transferred all Information to the new phone. I uploaded everything. I even reinstalled the program, but I could not find any button to jmeasure my stress level, pulse ox and heart rate my galaxy 22. I give five stars, BUT NOT HAPPY right now"
This app is now garbage since the recent removal of the weight management widget. I will need to see if MyFitnessPal can completely replace Samsung health. Up until now I used both for different things. Good job Samsung. If you held a focus group I think you would find everyone loved that widget. Now it's time to uninstall.
I was using this app. It was simple and user friendly. But now its asking to access my contacts. And I am unable to understand what thay need to access MY CONTACTS. MY CAMERA. MY DATA. All those things are very personal. Cant allow any app to access my PERSONAL CONTACTS. That's why I decided to uninstall this App.
"I have to say Thank You to the developers. When I wrote this review I really needed this function and it wasn't on my Galaxy watch or my phone for some reason. I just checked it on my phone & it was there. Again, Thank You! I absolutely LOVE this feature and I love Samsung Health. ‚ò∫Ô∏è I want to know why you got rid of the O2 measuring feature?! I have asthma & allergies & I ALWAYS used it to check my oxygen level! I WANT IT BACK PLEASE! You'll get 5 stars when it comes back!"
"Update: Still no enhancements to sleep cycles or food measurements as noted in my previous review. Need better sleep stages tracking detail: Time in light/deep sleep/wakeups, w/ samsung watch. Fitbit tracks sleep cycles. This only tells you the time you feel asleep and woke up, I don't need to wear the watch to track that. Also, could use more measurement options for food(example: oz., cups, and spoon measurements). Samsung health, has some serious catching up to do when compared to other apps."
"Updated comments 04/14/21: This app updated without my approval again and now wants permission to access phone/contacts!?!?!?!?!?!? NOTHING IN THIS APP NEEDS MY CONTACTS! It asks for permission, but if denied to contacts it won't open. NOW I CAN'T USE THE APP AT ALL FOR MY RUNS 4 OR 5 TIMES A WEEK! Last review: Was great until it updated without warning and removed ""weight management"" feature! I use this app specifically for this feature to stay on track with diet and exercise."
"If you want the old version read till the end...New version requires phone access and 2 step verification why? All this did was count steps and measure blood oxygen and set weight goals, calorie count. If you want the last good version before they forced phone access and 2 step verification go to july 14th 2020, v6.5.10.5.031 on apk pure google is your friend."
"At 12:57 PM I updated Samsung Health. At 10:03 PM I checked in to see how I was doing. I found that I was missing steps, distant & time. My steps 2317 not 7098. My time 19 mins not 64 mins & my distant 1.37 not 2.91. what happened why did it stop tracking after update & how am I going to get it back. How do I know what my information should be because I also have Pacer to help keep track as well because this is not the first time this happened after a update."
"Samsung Health REQUIRES access to your cell phone number for its ""Samsung Health Together"". This is a privacy violation. I don't want people knowing I'm using Samsung Health. I don't want people sending me invites. I want to use Samsung Health in privacy. Samsung: Too Bad."
"Absolutely horrible, changed to a pixel phone and it doesn't allow to sign in. I can enter my ID and password but then just a white screen with a circle. Oh it has been going on for 10 hours and still can't connect. UPDATE: 24 hours and still can't sign in. Spent 48 minutes waiting to speak to someone at Samsung and finally gave up!!!! Returning the galaxy watch 3. If you don't have a Samsung phone DON'T BUY THE WATCH"
Don't use the global challenges it won't update and you won't get the stars. At 11:53pm I was 2 steps away from getting the star so I walked around some to make sure I would get it. It updated at midnight saying I missed the star but when I woke up it updated and I was 23 steps over what I needed. Very frustrating.
"I used Samsung health all the time, especially the step counter. I just touched the Icon and up that popped. Today it just won't open. I have tried everything to get it to open, including updating it. I have followed all directions, but to no avail. I don't know why this has happened. I am extremely disappointed in Samsung for doing this to me."
Best fitness App ever Please can we get more sleep insights
"This app was useful back when the phone had an oxygen and a heart rate sensor, now, it's as useless as everything else that doesn't pertain to making calls, sending messages or media consumption... Basically, it's now just another platform meant for Samsung to squeeze a little extra money out of you. SAMSUNG: we do NOT need another app to measure our steps or send us promotions, please update the existing apps instead of designing new ones or fix the camera on my useless $1500 phone!!!"
"**CALL THE NUMBER PROVIDED IN REPLY!the rep will send the {negative} feedback which can result in change next update** Not happy with this most recent update to the app. You can no longer have clear tracking of your daily totals for macro and micro nutrients. This is imperative to so many people that track their food intake, even more important than simply tracking calories alone. Please bring back the ability to see our totals for fat, carbs, proteins, and the micronutrients"
"The developers of this app have deleted my rating now for a second time. It might now be time to get a lawyer involved! The new update now forces people to create a Samsung account. I refuse to set up yet another account I need to keep track of. Having Samsung track and storing my health data on their servers is unacceptable. Only my family, my doctor, and I need to know what my health status is. Never using this app again."
"No way phone permissions should be REQUIRED to use this app. Thanks for the response but the point stands. How about make 'together' optional and then require phone? I'm not happy with the ""scouts honor we don't do anything with phone permissions but get a unique ID"". Might be true today but nothing keeps that from expanding with no notice, correct? My interest is limited to gaining access to my health metrics from the devices I paid for. Any additional permissions should be OPTIONAL."
Syncing Is shocking especially when you've worked hard to close the rings on your watch.
"Updated for new version (6.15.0.091 - January 2021). - the new UI is a mess, particularly the section for recording food intake. Why have you consolidated the previous 3 separate entries for Morning, Afternoon and Evening snacks into just one entry per day ?! The inability to sync anything with Garmin watches (a very large part of the market) remains a problem."
"I love this app. Its easy to use and is generally accurate. The only suggestion I have is, much like MyFitnessPal, make it so that food can be logged by scanning the barcodes on food items."
"""The new updated"" version my husband and I do not like at all!!!. First I can NO longer record heart rate and blood ox. Now, after I got my new S21 I can't open because app needs my contacts. What? No freaking way samsung. I have deleted this app all together. Changes need to be made in order to get me back."
"It was a good app when I used it years ago. Decided to come back and I find this permission thing about managing my calls. Wow, let me run back to apple cause this is a disaster. You really don't deserve even the one star I gave but I had no choice. It seems you also don't want to listen to your customers, arrogance perhaps??ü§î"
"I really love this app and how it ties to my Samsung watch. The food intake needs to be more detailed. I had to manually add my daily vitamin because it wasn't in the database yet (it was listed as the one a day pro active, but all of the nutrients were zero). And then I noticed there's a lot of nutrients that don't get logged when you log your food. Vitamins D, b6 and b12 for starters would be awesome. Thanks guys and keep up the good work!"
"I just started really using the app, so far I love how I can track my calorie intake, activity, etc. I do wish the food portion would also track sugar intake, it will track protein, fiber, vitamin a & c, potassium, calcium, saturated fat, sodium, and iron, but not sugar? Hopefully in a next update they will add that on! Other than that, I enjoy it!"
After posting this review Samsung reached out to me. They will pass on my concerns to the S Health developers. I raised my review to 4 stars and will go to 5 if this problem is fixed. At least Samsung shows interest. I have a Galaxy S9+ phone with this app. Table Tennis is one of the activities I use often. I recently got an Active 2 watch that has the Health app but does not support table tennis. Why on the phone but not on the watch app ???
"When I got a Samsung watch a few years back I didn't need a Samsung account. After I couldn't access the app without it I thought of selling the product because of the changes. Now I said to give it a try and after 5 minutes I saw i have to give my phone number and access to my phone calls(which a few months ago wasn't necessary) sooo no thank you, i will sell this product and never come back :)"
"App keeps crashing when im opening the app for the first time post download. Tried the steps provided, still not fixed, and its crashing at the first page itself so it isn't going ahead for login, so can't go to settings, im using a one Plus 7t"
"Ability to record blood oxygen stopped working after switching to S22. Otherwise good app. Even after the last update pulse and oxygen can no longer be updated, categorized, or entered directly into the program on the S22. Sad decrease functionality from the S9 to the S22"
"What have you done to this app? Since the latest update the number of steps needed to log 10 km on the treadmill has now increased by approximately 1,500... It now takes me longer to run 10K on the treadmill than it does on the road which is crazy. Not to mention the new 'voice' which sounds like an expiring robot! I used to love my Samsung Watch combined with the Samsung Health app but am now considering switching to Garmin or another of the recognised brands. You've completely ruined this app!"
"I would give this 5 stars if I could manually adjust the step count. Sometimes I have to plug in my phone, or I do an exercise video using my phone and that can mean a several thousand step difference. Please add this feature! Thanks!"
"As we can see Samsung doesn't care about users' opinions, I don't expect any update to bring back the features they ripped off any more, so I just uninstalled the new update, and googled the old version. Now I am having the weight management and everything back. Samsung please stop your arrogance and listen to your customers."
"Even 1 star is too much. Not fit for purpose. I have a Samsung phone and made a huge mistake getting a Samsung watch only to find they have discontinued the weight management app. I'll be selling this rubbish and going back to Fitbit, so much better. Shame on you Samsung... UPDATE:. Thank you for your generic response üôÑ. My rating will remain as is until such time as Samsung starts caring about their customers... I won't hold my breath!"
"I've been using this app occasionally for a couple years to measure my heart rate. When I tried opening it today, it asked me to create an account, which had never happened before. Samsung, why would you lock me out of my own app on my own phone? I don't want to create an account, nor to store, transfer, or back up any data to the could. I just want to open the app, measure my heart rate, and be done with it. How can I revert to a previous version of the app?"
Had to uninstall and reinstal the App on my phone because the Blood Pressure Monitor wasn't showing in the version I had. I now have a recording facility and tried to calibrate the watch as directed by a you tube video entering 3 readings from a blood pressure machine however a recording capability seems to be all it can do. I can't find any button on the App or watch to actually take a blood pressure reading. Do I need to up date the watch's operating system again as I only did this recently?
"This app makes it look like i don't move... Can no longer add steps or movements when moving, unless the ap says so....sooo So if i go for a walk (without my phone) i can't add those steps So, if i move without my phone... it won't add it. ..... I don't carry my phone on me all the time. So this was HUGE bonus for me . So I could track and add it accordingly."
"A recent update has broken the nutrition calculations in the food tracker.  Some nutrients, like calcium, are specified in a food entry as a percentage of the daily requirement.  However when you add that food item to a meal, the roll up to the ""Nutrient intake summary"" takes those percentages and uses them as quantities. Consequently, a serving of the milk I drink provides 35% of the daily requirement of calcium but shows up as 35 mg of calcium in the summary.  UPDATE: I received an email from Google that stated, ""If you would like to discuss your issues in more detail with the developer, you can contact the developer directly by emailing Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. or replying to this email.""  The email supplied to contact Samsung looked suspicious (a no-reply like name); nevertheless, I spent quite a bit of time drafting a preliminary bug report and even included some suggested enhancements. But, as foretold by prophesy, my email was bounced with a ""This email is for Sent-Only and cannot be replied"" response. This is completely asinine."
"The app is really great for detecting my workout routine. Unfortunately, as for the food part, there are limited dishes to be noted down and some are not accurate. Can u guys just update the food dishes based on the user living in a particular country? It would be really great if u guys do this."
"Can no longer check your blood oxygen or heart rate, completely. When using the cycling, running or walking tracker, it stops for far too long if you stop at a crossing. It's a completely rubbish and pointless app now!"
Not happy that Samsung REMOVED the oxygen saturation measurement in Samsung Health. I bought the phone because it had this. Now the sensor on the phone is useless and have to switch to apple. Its not right to just REMOVE features that were in the device and advertised when purchased with no reason or alternative app. What's more is the reply from Samsung is a canned reply stating to use the stress function which is. It available in Canada. So no further ahead. And I cant reply to their response
Since recent update app is now not keeping any of my trending history. No access to past step count. I used the help function and the reply wasn't helpful at all. Seeing other ppl post on here and the generic response received to call the phone number listed (you do release people live outside of the US? We cannot use that number) extremely disappointed. If this isn't rectified ill be uninstalling and using a different app or device.
"Seriously, would love to see micro-nutrients added! And make diet area a little bigger along w the button to get too. Overall for macro-nutrient breakdown the app is gorgeous! Would like to see micro nutrient break down as well. I love this app though. :)"
"I updated the app and now it's asking for permission to make/manage phone calls. I do NOT want it to, so I denied it, but the app does not let me do anything, so it's completely useless. I cannot access the data I was previously able to, so this is a huge step back :( I'm not going to let the app bully me into giving it permission it does not need. I'm uninstalling it, and if this is not fixed then I'm not going to buy any Samsung device in the future. > Unique HW id is against best practices!"
Is clear cache the only thing you can say to all customers. It's BS I've uninstalled the app and reinstalled and it still doesn't sync. I bet any money Samsung purposely released an update to cause an issue with older devices hoping you'd buy a new watch. Disgraceful from you shower of c**ts
"I have been attempting to use this app since 1/16 when I got a new galaxy watch but I have yet to be able to open the app on my phone. Once I sign in, the app just endlessly ""loads"" (the little circle just keeps spinning). I've tried clearing the cache and uninstalling/reinstalling. Anything else that would get it to work?"
After the last update the option to track weight seems to be gone. Also a suggestion: the UI/UX for tracking sleep or exercise could be better and more clear to read (like the one on amazfit zepp app).
"Used to be simple app. Samsung has me running in circles to use the app. Forcing me sign in etc. They've forgotten why people liked the app. It accessible and simple. It would be too easy to say: I have a Samsung phone, so pair it up with a Samsung app, right Samsung? Congratulations for fixing what wasn't broken. You've wasted my time. So now let me go find an efficient app that's upto par"
"No problems with app since i bought this phone. Then there's an update (23/4/21 privacy update)and I can't access my steps or anything. After 30minutes of trying to get access I uninstalled and reinstalled. Total waste of time. I still can't access todays steps data or any previous data. I'll have to wait I buy a new phone, at least 12 months. Why don't Samsung/Google product test updates, are they useless or what?"
App doesn't stay synced with my watch & there's no option to sync steps manually.
I cannot access get the App because it won't let me verify the code that was sent to my phone. I TRIED FOUR TIMES AND AM HELPLESS. Not sure how to get help. Update Thank you for your response. I tried again once I had calmed down. The keyboard was hiding the verify button and this time It responded. Thank you so much !
"Used to be a great app, until they started requiring users to sign in to a Samsung account. I would love to keep using it, but am unwilling to have all my highly sensitive health information tied to an account (with my name and phone number and other identifying information) that can be traced back to me. Please change it back to how it was. Until then, great job Samsung, you just lost a customer."
I used to love this app but ever since the update the app is not working properly. I have cleared the cache. But the app just sits at the waiting for update screen and never changes no matter how long I have it open. Frustrating.
"I recently bought a Samsung Galaxy Active watch and am trying to register for Samsung Health for it. It will not let me sign in. I just keep getting the circle to indicate its doing something but never actually does. I have uninstalled and reinstalled the app numerous times, turned my phone on and off numerous times, as I have for the watch. No matter what it will not proceed to sign in. Can you help please?"
The app seems to have has some compatibility problem with ONEPLUS firmware OxygenOS version 10.3.5. I uninstalled and reinstalled the app from Play Store and now it will not login to my Health account even though I can login to my Samsung account. Have been using the app for a while and have generally been quite happy with it otherwise. But now I'm unsure whether I will be able to use it on the device or not. App developers - please look at this issue.
"Your food list is too complicated. I type in capsicum, i don't eat tin capsicum it's fresh... but not listed. You need to simplify it. I eat sausages and only woolworth's are listed, I shop at coles and buy WA Harvey beef sausages which are better for you. Am trying to see this as a positive app but... I can't have my phone on me during work hours except breaks and then I don't meet my steps, I run around all day but can't afford a fitbit... great but needs improvement."
"NFC alert comes whenever I try and scan my diabetes sensor which is to be used by another app. Instead I have no option to turn off the notification asking if I want to use Samsung Health to open the NFC data. For the record, this app doesn't even read the data on the sensor. How can I keep Samsung Health running but not have it try and read the NFC sensor data when my phone scans for it? Otherwise I'll have to uninstall. Edit: please a UK phone number rather than a +1 US number"
"Activity tracking is not working Started running activity, GPS locked on but timer does not start. Cannot even finish or end the started activity. Need to force stop the app via app details Using s20 FE btw. Seems to happen only recently and the latest update does not seems to solve this Latest update: Did some 101 troubleshooting myself Uninstall and reinstall and setup the app again and all were back to norm Not sure if the update might have caused certain files corruption Anyway all gd nw"
"I am really enjoying this app! One thing I would really like to see on it though is a gardening option in the excercise part. I spent about two hours this morning pulling weeds, shoveling off a sidewalk area, and doing other misc things in my garden. I worked up a great sweat, but dont know where to add it to my activities. üò•"
"Can you add a section for postpartum and breastfeeding women so we can keep track how many calories we burn breastfeeding and how many calories we need to lose weight and still make enough milk to feed baby. Also of you could add verious exercises you do with baby like pushing a stroller when you go for a walk, or walking with your baby on you in a infant carrier. if you could add these things it would be a 5 star app."
I really love the app and its a wonderful addition to my health journey.. suggestion would be to add a reminder to take medicine while letting us mark that we actually took it.. that way theres not as many occurences of remembering medication a few hours later and not knowing if we took it or not. Also.. socializing with other users could be improved.
Very good app for tracking and encouraging you to live a healthier lifestyle.
i do not understand why your calorie intake stays the same each day. it does not matter if you burn more calories every day it is recommended the same. this is a huge let down because it shows i eat to much if i work out and do not eat enough if i do not. this makes no sense to me why track the calories if you burn if the app does no use that information in a useful way? this is such a disappointment compared to other competiting fitness and diet apps.
I agree with do many of the recent feedback comments and complaints about the app needing permission to make and receive calls. Instead of your generic answer about only using permissions to provide features it would be more helpful if you actually said why it makes and receives calls. Now I find it is to request a text for two factor authentication. How does that protect me? If someone has my phone they will still get the text. Use different 2FA and get rid of this permission!
"EVERYONE TURN OFF YOUR AUTO UPDATES FOR THIS!! Awesome app, or was awesome because since the last update it doesn't show my caffeine intake anymore nor can i see the ""trends"" for my work outs so now I have to figure out how many days I've worked out by going to active time and finding particular work outs. AND it's not tracking my steps as well as it use to. WHY change a good thing?? Really? Uh"
"Latest update is terrible. Workouts dont work half the time, literally the timer will freeze at random intervals, the milliseconds on the clock will keep running but the minute and seconds will stay stuck, and the workout will stop recording calories expended. Additionally the calorie counter seems even more inaccurate than ever. As 5'10 35M the BMR is insanely low. Even with 800 activities calories expended from workouts im somehow under 2k total cals expended a day."
Really you want access to all my contacts etc before I can use it?? Data mining on a massive scale. which is a shame as it used to be good. Shame on you for your privacy invasion. I'm just glad this happened before I actually bought another Samsung watch. Time to uninstall and look for another app and a different phone company next time.
2019... Love the Samsung Health App for my new Samsung Galaxy Smartwatch 46mm. It is helping me reach my weight loss goals I made at the beginning of the year. Thank you Samsung!!! 8/25/2022 The Samsung (1st Gen) Galaxy Smartwatch 46mm is still going strong. No scratches on the crystal and have just upgraded the band to a 22mm Shark Mesh Stainless Steel. Looks better than ever! I did purchase a Samsung Smartwatch 4 Classic and returned it as it really wasnt much difference than the 1st Gen...
"Removed weekly/monthly trends for many items I used. No one reviews daily trends for weight management, step activity, or to monitor their blood pressure. *It's been weeks since the last update, why haven't you fixed all of the reported issues? Plenty of feedback has been given but no update has been released, or timeline on when we can expect it. (The 5 star reviews for this app appear to be fake)"
"The app all along is ok, but today, it keeps saying ""updating"" for the past few hours. Cannot resolve the problem with app updating or restarting phone. Update: managed to resolve the problem by clearing data and cache and restart the app will do."
"Im a former certified trainer who for years has used Samsung Health and had others follow. A recent update by the program has disabled it and all I get is ""unknown error 0x2A#0."" I uae this program to track the 8-14 miles I put in daily...well, used to...and I've vested into Samsung because of it. Guess its time to make a change. Anyone out there have suggestions? I'm totally bummed!"
The sleep score is all messed up. Recent update messed is up. I use to get a score of 70 to 80 now it is 30 to 40. Not recording any deep sleep. I know this because I started using my Fitbit at night knowing Samsung is not correct.
"USE TO BE a 5 star üåü app.. but now after some of the ""updates"" it's not good as it use to be. -Main update I hate is when it thinks you slept (but you weren't) & then you do go sleep it divides your sleep & now you can't erase just that one clip when you weren't sleeping.. it'll delete the hole sleep recording instead!"
I used to love this app. Easy to use but they wanted permission to access my phone and contacts which I found intrusive and unnecessary for a fitness app. I really don't like being Forced to agree to something just to use an app...there are too many others available. I've decided to Uninstall this app and use something else. You're violating my privacy way too much! Good bye Samsung Health.
"I enjoyed using this app until the recent software update. Why it now needs to access my contacts, phone and photos etc in order to record my foot steps I'll never know. There's obviously no such thing as privacy where these companies are involved. Disgusting really, so I've uninstalled it . No doubt they'll be some lame excuse why all these permissions are needed from Samsung, which will probably say its needed for a better user experience etc etc , sorry Samsung, don't believe it."
"I no longer have the option to select my gear s3 as the single source for steps. I can only select all steps or phone. why us this? also its recording steps during a bike ride. this cannot be right surely? seems as like the 2 issues are linked and because I record a ride on my gear s3 but have my phone in my pocket it thinks I've done the steps. A huge step backwards. Please dont ask me to call a no in another country to resolve, I contacted you by email with no response, very poor"
"I used to be able to check my o2. I got covid more causing breathing problems and the only way to check my o2 is to go to the hospital. That o2 sensor would be a great help please and thank you. I'll change my rating back to 5 stars as features are returned to a once great app. Please don't remove features, only add as that's what makes a superior app"
I lost alot of weight by following the instructions on calorie intake. I also learned alot about diet and improving my vitamin intake. I only gave it 3 stars is because my vitamin A kept saying high intake (red) and effecting my nutrient score when everything else was green. And to much vitamin a intake can be deadly. But only vitamin A from animals (preformed) can be toxic. Proformed vitamin A is not harmful and is in all vegetables and fruits. So it makes impossible to get a 100 nutrient score
"I have used this app for many years. I used it for my gear fit and my gear fit 2. I just received the Galaxy Watch Active 2. Set everything up and was happy. I walked today and usually my phone and watch are different when I go to all steps my phone has more steps. Well now it changes the steps on my watch to match my phone! I cannot get my steps on this app from my watch to the phone to show up. It shows 0 and list Gear Fit 2. On the information screen it says: Steps from the following watches can't be viewed separately: Galaxy Watch Active 2 I sat on my chair and had my husband walk around with my phone, put on around 100 steps and gave it back to me. I waited a little while and then my watch added the steps from the phone! What is up with this? Maybe it is in a setting, hopefully."
"My wife bought me the Galaxy watch (which I believe had this app preloaded) to replace my old fitness tracker. When I work out I do interval training, but always just choose ""weight machines"" to keep things simple and no matter how hard I push myself it always says that I burn 300 calories at the 30 minute mark. To test that it's not doing it's job I chose the ""weight machine"" option today and just surfed on my phone. It still calculated that I burned 297 calories at the 30 minute mark."
"Hopeless. Displayed maps of runs for about 3 days, then stopped. Said it can measure interval training. It can't. After a 10 mile run it says it can't measure VO2 max because I wasn't moving for more than 10mins. Absolutely rubbish."
"great app for tracking everything in one place, the steps are very accurate. Macro percentages are completely messed up though. 131.6g/259.5g is 0.507, not 36% as the app says. 81.6/259.5 is 0.314 not 51% and 46.3/259.5 is 0.178 not 13%. All 3 macro numbers don't line up to actual percent ratios of what you eat."
"Since the last update, the app does not sync with my Samsung watch. I can no longer see my correct steps or active minutes. I have tried everything I can to fix this without success."
"This used to be a great app. This app, connected to my Active Watch 2 and myfitnesspal, helped me to lose a third of my body weight - and more recently has been helping me to learn to balance calories more naturally. The latest updates have removed the calorie tracker and the link to myfitnesspal which makes this app useless and myfitnesspal far less useful. Don't waste your money on a samsung watch - a garmin or fitbit are probably the better choice now. Very disappointed in samsung."
Keeps crashing just seconds upon opening. This has been happening for months now. Very disappointed with the developers. How can they let this happen for this long. Looking at the reviews I am not the only one experiencing this.
After latest update I need to sync with phone to see sleep metrics. App is required to have increased access to phone and it has nothing to do with safeguarding your privacy. You are on a slope in wrong direction Samsung. I am also unable to log into my health app anymore. I feel so disappointed with latest update. Thx
It wouldn't let me open the app so I uninstalled and reinstalled. Now it won't let me past the 2 step verification. I paste or type in the verification code and it won't let me continue. Now I have no access to anything from my watch other than today's data. I love my watch but useless if not supported by app.
Water reminder notifications would be great. Can you please being them back? I hate having to install a separate app just to get my reminders. And I've tried several apps and they no longer sync since the recent Android update.
"I used to like this app for counting daily steps. But now it won't open until I grant permission for it to make calls. I will not grant this permission to a health app. I don't want 2-step verification to be forced on me. It should be my choice. Samsung, please give us the choice about these new features. Otherwise I will find a new app."
"I loved this app is my Note 8, I have since purchased the Note 10+ and to my dismay, the health app no longer has the oxygen level and the stress monitor requires you to purchase the band or the watch. Why should I have to do that??? If anything, I have upgraded, which always means I purchased another product from Samsung which was pricey, so why should I be required to purchase an accessory when I did not have to do it with the same app on an older product? I'm really disappointed."
if I could give it zero stars I would. used the pulse oximeter about 30 times a day till you took it away with one of the last updates. was using it to graph my o2 for my pulmonologist and all my data is gone and I can no longer use the meter.. that's why I bought this phone and now it no longer has it. when its returned I'll give the app more stars.
So far so good. New s22. Would like to see paddleboaring added to the activity type.
"Like it, but can you please bring back the manual buttons so I can can check my readings when I want to along with the automatic. Also, bring back the O2 tracking. It doesn't work anymore. I'm not getting anymore O2 readings"
"EDIT 2 (2021 April): cannot start Samsung Health as it requires permission to make phone calls, without any explanation. Won't happen. EDIT: Oxygen measurement is back! Many thanks for addressing this. Wrote earlier: Oxygen measurement history is no longer kept by the app, it is baked into a ""stress level"". But that is not very scientific or correct."
"Best health app I have found! My only problem is the week summeries no longer work, it told me all for the first week and has not updated since. Please tell me how to fix this??? Apart from that it has everything combined that you could want, calorie counter, pedometer and lots of different work outs to choose from. Have food and exercise combined means I can overindulge some days and then work off the extra calories with the same app!! Well done guys :)"
I have no option to go lower. Should be a zero or minus star rating but it seems Samsung just can't accept that some things don't even deserve to be in the positive area in a rating I have no use for nor interest in this app but I cannot uninstall so I dislike it even more. Completely irrelevant for my life but still I have to put up with it. Perfect example of too bad so sad samsung will stick it right in your face regardless of you.
The app was great until you updated and removed some of the best features. The weight management and the caffeine counter. I used the weight management to see how many calories I burned for the day. This helped me see my calorie differential. Now that this is gone the fitness part is useless for me. I'm trading this watch in for a fitbit.
"My only gripe is with the trophy system congratulating me on going 62.13 miles. Which is 100 km. I'd be nice if you could set your own weekly goal away from the default 100km so it's like 50,75, 100 miles. I only use this app while biking."
What happened to the O2 saturation measurement! Was hoping that it would be fixed with the last update! I don't even have an option for the stress measurement! I used the O2 measurement all the time! It's easier than having to carry my pulse ox measurer. Please fix or bring it back very soon!
"Samsung is a waste of your time, money and privacy. Bought Galaxy watch 4, and tried to install this app in good hopes of monitoring heart rate. But it doesn't let me sign in. Also tried creating Samsung account with different email IDs and still this (and other apps like Samsung pay) don't recognize their Samsung account. I'. still able to access Samsung account through browser. Without proper apps Samsung experience is a waste of ur time/money besides it collects lots of ur private details."
"I've used this app for years and found it really beneficial, that was until the update. You had an app that was feature-rich with easy to use interface and have totally destroyed it. It's crazy, why would you think this is a step forward? I used to use the app daily without fail, can't bring myself to use it at all now, please please please put it back to how it was!"
"I used to have a samsung phone that came with this app. Unfortunatley it was stolen. I've since moved to an LG, but I downloaded this app again because it's far superior to all other health apps. My favorite part is that you can do monthly global challenges! They really help me push myself. I'll always use this app, and highly suggest it!"
Useless. Just stopped working one day. No reply from developer. Will have to use a different app
"Ruined after update. I used this specifically for how much sleep I've had. This function/ display appears to have been removed for some bizarre reason! Absolutely of no use to me anymore as it no longer does what I was using it for every day. Common theme, everytime anyone updates an app they ruin it, will now be deleted as its of no use to me. Samsung please look at all the bad reviews since the update and use your brains...your customers really don't like it, wake up!"
Awful. Brand New watch. App is unusable on a Pixel 4. Loading screen after login and never goes anywhere. Have to return the watch and reminds me why I don't buy Samsung products. Will pick up the Fitbit tomorrow. Should hand gone with my gut. Sad... Sad... Sad.. Update: I recieved the standard delete my cache response... Ya... I did that. I also installed and restalled a bunch of times. Read the complaints in your site from all the non Samsung phone users that have an app that is unusable.
"Insane new permission requests. Why would a health app need permission to ""make and manage phone calls""? And don't give me this ""trust us"" bs that you're using when replying to every other review complaining about the same issue. Give us, in layman's terms, real reasons to why you guys need our contact information and permission to manage phone calls. It's a shame because I've used this app since the beginning but I'm uninstalling. Good bye."
"Used to use this all the time to track my stress level, heart rate, and oxygen. Just purchased the new Samsung Note 10+ and it measures NONE of these! So I downloaded a separate heart rate app that will measure it. Samsung Health says this phone isn't capable of measuring, so why can a different app not made by Samsung measure it? Not impressed, Samsung..."
This is an incredibly effective and easy to use application. Not only do I love it but I easily lost 50 lbs and got myself in great shape. Best multifeatured application. Get it for yourself and see how the fat melts away and the muscle build with no effort whatsoever.
"Overall pretty good, however the app keeps sending a notification to my phone saying ""Samsung account session expired. Sign into Samsung account again"" which is strange because everything in the app is still working fine... It's still signed in and everything."
Used to be a great app. Last update was definitely not an improvement. No longer tells me how many carbs I had in a day. Has weird graphics now that takes away from displaying the actual info I want. Is there a way to go back to the previous update? Because if this doesn't change I will be looking for a different app.
"Gutted. This app just lost several useful features including caffeine tracking and weight management. LOL at Samsung's official reply. Yeah, go ahead and add back the features you removed, then the issue will be resolved, but I know calling you isn't going to convince you to bring those features back so why even suggest it? Is it because you didn't even bother to read my review? This reply is just automated? PUT THE REMOVED FEATURES BACK, SIMPLE."
"Update: As of the last couple days the Sleep feature is not reporting the stages of sleep anymore. And still no blood pressure. My big disappointment is that I understood the FDA approved Samsung Blood Pressure app. In reality, Samsung has not turned on the app in the US from what my research has identified. Because of Health reasons this was one of the 2 major reasons I selected the Watch3. Very dissapointed in Samsung. I will revisit my rating when or if Samsung turns on Blood Pressure app."
"As a longtime physical activity person and as a personal trainer, also with a bachelor of science in human nutrition BSc, this app is the best bar none! Better than my Fitness Pal, better than the Apple fitness app, its only flaw is it hasn't got the food scanner of my fitness pal. However, the built in food database is massive an extentful... Simply the best."
Still no good I have tried to measure my heart beat and since the update as gone on it now won't work I had no trouble with it before. I haven't got the patience with this app to me it's a complete waste of time trying to use it. Well it's now off my phone and it's stopping off totally garbage I don't do excersise I am happy just sat about doing nothing and putting on as much weight as I possibly can as I ain't bothered about my health issues and health problems.
"It's full of ads. I see giant banner advertisements flashing and rotating for other Samsung products, Netflix, and even health insurance companies. Makes me skeptic as to how they treat my personal health related data at the same time taking money from advertisers in private health sectors. *Edit: Regardless of what Samsung says, when 1/4th of the screen is a bright red with pictures and big text that says ""First Access to a sneak peak from Netflix's The Old Guard. Learn More >"", it an ad."
"I'm not understanding why I can't see the HR as a linear trend, as opposed to hourly increments, even though I have it set to measure continuously. It also is telling me I've had incidences of very high HR over 200 several times but I don't get any kind of alert. The alert that is available to be set is above 150 for over 10 mins at rest so thats not helpful to me at all. Is the watch not naturally programmed to alert for what is obviously an unhealthy HR at any point resting or active??"
"Was pretty good until the recent update. After this latest update it changed my calorie requirements and, no matter the deficit between the calories I have consumed and the caloriesI have burned, the Weight Management section always says I am over! If My Fitness Pal worked with my SGear watch that's what I'd be using. Their app is superior in almost every way."
Wish there was an option to change the hours to a 24 hour clock. I work overnights so it splits my steps into two days.
I missed the weight control too.. can u roll back to the old version first while the developer work on the new version? I have contacted Samsung via online chat so far there is no callback. I do not stay in US. Please do not expect me to call that number. The email contact is a noreply address. Seems to be Samsung is not interested to be contacted
Flop ...it's not working properly...when we use walking....auto pause happen with in a second....
"Cannot use the app without agreeing to excessive permissions that it does not need. Now I can't access features of my watch for that reason. Decided to stop using the app. EDIT: Despite the response, I stand by my comment. I refuse to grant that permission and I am upset that access to my data is now denied by a feature I did not request, nor desire to use."
This used to be great as a sleep tracker. It would automatically detect when you put your phone down for the night and when you picked it up again the next day why does this no longer work? You now have to manually enter the times.
"Generally good, but each update is too much of a reset, not a simple enhancement. Syncing between watch and phone is inconsistent, sometimes going hours without syncing."
"Dear Samsung, Yes, i perfectly understand how apps work, don't need a lecture on how to use apps. My question is why do you need to encroach on my privacy? A user should have the choice whether or not to share their phone no! I find it odd that access to activity sensors are optional for a health tracking app whilst phone number is mandatory requirement. I don't need 2 step verification! Used the app extensively prior to this being mandated. Stopped using the app now."
Issue with sync to other app. I had used this app to sync to my fitness pal for tracking steps v calories. It stopped working and my fitness pal advised there is an issue with Samsung . Can you please assist. Ps I have tried clearing cache and reinstalling apps already
"I like this app thanks, but it is better that the person can create any challenge between his/her friends, not only one friend, already uou can create that challenge, but the important other one is challenge between more one friend. I wish that you will add that page."
"drained my battery and had a ""lovely"" notification banner which I found uninstalling the app was easier than figuring out how to get rid of the banner. Maybe make the settings a little more clear and when you pause counting steps maybe actually pause the app.."
"NO MORE SAMSUNG! I've loyally used Galaxy phones for YEARS bc I find the UI very intuitive; also have S2 Gear watch & Tab A (love both). But last 2 phones (S7 & S9+) OVERFLOW W BLOATWARE & REDUNDANT APPS. Preloading so customers will TRY your apps is fine, but WHY NOT LET US UNINSTALL? Buyers won't use apps we hate bc you do this, we'll just root or switch! If you have to FORCE YOUR APPS on your customers, you already LOST! Saying SAYONARA & switching to GOOGLE PHONE/SVC AS SOON AS PIXEL 4 DROPS!"
I do like this app but I don't understand why sometimes it tracks my sleep sometimes it doesn't. When I click on the app and scroll down I can see my sleep time for a split second and then it's gone. Maybe I'm not doing something right. Other than that I have no issues.
"Used to work fine, not I can't get in at all. Blocked by a two step verification that won't actually let me verify the account. I get the text code, enter the code, try to submit the code annnnnddd no beeeaanns... Won't let me verify... Until it gets fixed don't get this app."
"My only issue is not being able to further customize my Fitness page. I know it brings up workouts meant to cater to me per my age, weight, interests, etc. I'm 35 and purposely can't have kids anymore yet I'm getting recommended workouts for pre/during/post pregnancy bc I'm still of child bearing age. I'm clearly not interested those workouts. Is there anyway to get rid of those."
Latest update removed the weight management option! Why? This was a very useful feature that I relied on and it made this app unique. I am not happy that it was suddenly removed with no warning. It makes no sense to remove this valuable tool!
Typical Samsung. They fill your phone with their BLOAWARE but this time they remove one of the few useful hardware features the Note4 was designed with. Talking about a UV sensor. Yes I can look at the Sun and see its high UV but now they removed that feature I'm not impressed. Imaging purchasing a car and finding after a software update that they failed to inform you that they removed Power Steering function. No wonder so many people moving to oneplus and even Apple.
"What a POS. Can't get past the 2step verification setup w/o crazy errors. Who programmed this, a bunch of rabid lemurs? Run away. Also the main reason I got a Galaxy watch. What a mistake.. Update: Finally got it installed. You have to install then uninstall several times also restarting your phone in between and it finally works.."
"Wherd did the oxygen saturation measurement go that I had on my note 5? Wow, I was planning to get a Samsung watch, but with the endless number of complaints I just read about Samsung's policy of removing function from, in this case, the Samsung Health program, I have lost confidence that I can rely on consistant improvements when programs are updated. I currently have a Samsung cell phone. I may finally have to switch to a company who is truly interested in ther customers satisfaction."
Great app for fitness tracking. I've used it since 2014 and can track my stats since then. The cycling portion is great in that you can record routes and even load a gpx file to have a route to follow. This feature would require an expensive paid app if not here. Thanks.
"The issues with battery drain are fixed. A good app, but lacking detail considering the data collected by my Samsung gear s3. Drilling down into the data should be possible. I suppose this could be offered by a third party app?"
"I have paid for this top of the line phone, to be able to use the Spo2 and other health sensors. And at the peak of covid, Samsung decided, that's its the opportune time to force users to give up the privacy. And unwilling ones are unable to use the app. My point is, we were happy using this app for years, till you are trying to actively MINE our data, by manging phonecalls, contacts and what not. Why now? Huge breach of trust by Samsung. Correct it, or you will loose many loyals."
When I try to open the app on my new Galaxy S9+ an error message sayinig that the app can't be opened on a rooted device. I don't understand how is it possible if the device is not even rooted and the problem can't be fixed.
"By using this app to track my weight, glucose, blood pressure, water intake, calories and exercise I have lost 32 lbs toward my goal of losing 85 lbs and being healthy once again. I have also been able to stop taking all my medications, whoo hoo!!"
When can we expect the wieght management part of the app to come back? The weight management was the best feature in the app. It makes no sense why you would keep things like stress level monitor and remove wieght management.
Took away a part I used frequently because I'm an asthmatic. I would really like the Oximeter part of this app back because it allowed me to track my O2 levels easily for my pulmonologist. I love the food diary portion of the app as well as the exercise tracker.
"I love this app, I use it to track everything. One thing I wish it did have was a barcode scanner for scanning food that you eat. Not super important but it would make life easier! Overall a great app!"
"Used to use this app all the time, until the upgrade that is. Certainly will not allow any app to make and manage phone calls. They say it's for verification, which is absolutely pointless for me as I have zero phone signal where I live. So what's the point?"
"The application is great. I just hate the fact that during these ""challenges"" people are constantly cheating. What's the point in the challenges if the developer is allowing cheating to happen. It makes people not want to enjoy getting healthier."
"New update of January is terrible, took days to be able to log in, and when I did, all my past exercise data was gone. Considering changing my galaxy watch for another competitor as it has been over a month without solution. Very poor"
It really engages you and motivates you to be fit Update: now I have an issue with the application. It is not capturing my achievements and new records anymore. I reinstalled it but nothing.
"Do not update to the newest version. It requires access to manage your phonecalls, video and cameras. Without those permissions, the app no longer works. Shame. Used to really like the app."
"They just removed the ability to look at your weight by week or by month. So all you see is daily fluctuation, and too small a scale to detect meaningful progress. Why remove something useful? (There are several threads on the Samsung Community website bemoaning this ""update"" as well.)"
"I used to love this app on my Samsung Galaxy s5, however, on my newer Samsung J7 the step counter stopped working correctly & no longer counts my steps correctly. It will only count a few steps when I'm walking a long distance. I know how many steps it is to a daily location &, out of say 1000 steps it will only say 200 now. I've uninstalled & reinstalled the app but it still isnt reliable on a daily basis."
"Can you fix the add food part? for example, when adding Iron it says that 100%=18g, but in really this is equal to 100%=8g, and it would be nice to add another decimal since there is a lot of foods, that doesn't have 1 mg but 1 gram of food and when trying to make the conversion i can't add decimal numbers, so the solution might be adding everyhting in grams, give me the possibility to change the metric or add a new decimal"
"App sums the watch and phone step counts during a walk even though both are connected via Bluetooth, thus giving wrong results. Both Samsung smartwatch and health app running latest update. Why Samsung can't fix this!!?"
"I really love this app!! Being able to keep up with my steps, all activities, water intake, calorie intake, etc.. Also there are monthly challenges & challenges you can do with friends to keep you motivated!!"
"*All by itself measuring the distance time perfectly* As well as additional video guide to help workout , hence 5star ""Auto detect work"", not working perfect. If I walk for 5 kms, it shows only 1.5 kms. And even timings are also not perfect..."
"Awful. Since the Aug 2020 update, the app keeps crashing and closing within seconds of opening... UPDATE: Now the app won't open at all which means I can't see any of the date from my Galaxy watch. I tried their fix, but it hasn't worked"
"Permissions issue was fixed so now works again with the Health Sync app so I can sync with Google Fit. The app is better than the Samsung fitness tracking watch I use it with, makes me want to stick to the Samsung universe if I can maybe find a better watch from them."
Tha app ALWAYS crashes and drains the battery. It take forever to sync up right with my Samsung watch. It will sync but the data won't match! So I have to do EVERYTHING twice????????
Sometimes disconnects with the Active 2 watch which requires an uninstall/redownload of this app to fix. You know it's disconnected because the watch battery drains faster trying to reconnect. Very useful app outside of that issue.
Edit update: further the update form last year this update has just got worse! No calorie offset managment to see if you are within your calories or under with excersise tracking and now the overall layout is confusing and many useful i formation has dissappeard! Samsung are you reading your reviews to bring back certain things as all I have seen since these awful updates are disgruntled people with 1 stars because the app isn't doing its job! Why did I buy a fit watch if the functions have gone
I didn't like the update ... it was amazing before. the display before give u motivation because u see ur target clearly . And setting a target example 1 kg per week was east but now i straggled to find where i can do so ... and the new permission u r obliged to protect ur data .. what if i don't want and i don't want to put my phone number ?? This sooo annoying .. i deleted the app for sure
RUBBISH. The latest upgrade (DOWNGRADE) is useless. They have REMOVED the SpO2 OXYGEN SATURATION monitor with NO EXPLANATION. They are not responding to the numerous complaints on the issue. This is PATHETIC for such a large company. EVERYONE HAS LOST all their SpO2 data. Going to find another app and DITCH this one. Also make you never let Samsung hack your phone in this way again - DISABLE all updates from them. VERY VERY ANGRY !!!!!!!!
"Used to be good. Now it wants my contacts and manage my phone calls. Totally unnecessary intrusion to my privacy. I don't believe for a moment, knowing my contacts is needed for tracking my health. This WILL change my choice of next phone. Thanks for nothing Samsung. Samsung's explanation about the infringement of my privacy is laughable. I regret being a long time Samsung supporter. Will be switching."
I'm pretty active and this helps me keep track easier. Since i already have my phone on me most of the time theres no need for a workout journal. I like the little achievements too and as far as it goes for me the steps and running distance is accurate.
"Wanted to utilise my heartbeat sensor. Can't find option. When the sensor is touched.. app asks for permissions, even with all permissions enabled the sensor doesn't show up or work. Having all permissions enabled stops the message but does nothing more."
"Instead of fixing issues that customers have complained about for YEARS on the Samsung forum (like showing steps from workouts such as treadmill, running and walking so they get counted into daily step count- imagine that crazy idea when the main part of the app is DAILY STEP COUNT) they keep messing with insignificant details like where a button is located and call it improvement... I am sorry that I bought a Samsung watch and S10+ seeing as they completely ignore what users want and need."
I used the Quick measure HRM regularly during the day. But it apparently has been removed. Now the apps has little to no added value for me. why was this feature removed? I'm talking about the Quick HR measuring that you can do just by setting your finger on the sensor and turning it around...
unfortunately the update requires permission for the phone use. i have seen this is due to the together part but i don't want to use that aspect and cant access the app without granting permission such a shame as i loved that my samsung watch linked to it. i will have to find a new app and will choose not to get a samsung smart watch next time as a result
"I've been very happy with this app but now it with the privacy update it wants access to my contacts and my phone and a bunch of other unnecessary things. Please tell me how I can have my steps counted without that. otherwise I will look for a different app even though I've enjoyed this one and it came with my phone EDITED TO ADD: I looked at the explanation of why Samsung wants to use my camera, my phone+my contacts+ none of those things were necessary to me. I will be uninstalling this app"
"the app's version in the A70 is recording the wrong distance. i walked 20,000+ steps over a 21km distance but the app only recorded 9km. my old j70 pro was more accurate. uninstalled & re-installed & cleared cache twice. did not work. still recording wrong distance."
"I love the app but 2 things wrong. First, you should be allowed to add multiple friends to a challenge instead of one on one only. Second, we should be able to see who cheers our post on the community share page. Please add these features!!!! Much love!"
"I've used this app for a couple of years without problems, but the new update didn't allow me into the app, without a lot of trying to sort out, so I've deleted it and downloaded another one. Sorry Samsung, but I want ease of use, my time is precious enough."
The new update took away the weight control option . It was very helpful for me especially with tracking my calories on a daily basis. Please bring it back on the next release üò≠üôè other than I love the app. üòä
"I enjoy having all of my fitness items in one place, there could be some improvements in the food section. Like a bar code reader and the option to make a full meal and divide it into servings."
App is not working properly......asking for two step verification...even after verifying the otp...it again goes back to two step verification. This happened soo many times in multiple devices with different accounts. Very disappointed.
"Used this for a few months but since the last bug fix you did I've had problems. While running its freezing or pausing on it's own or something else, I'm just giving up on it now."
Several issues. Mostly the app doesn't record data in a useful format. After using the app with the Galaxy Active 2 for a week it randomly dumped about 4 days worth of heart monitoring data.and the hydration tracker is poorly conceived.
I find it really upsetting that with every update a feature gets taken down. Doesn't make sense to me. This time it was the caffeine tracker which used to be very convenient with the widget on the galaxy watch. Such a shame.
"Without any update on my phone or sync a new device all of my ""together"" data were lost. Statistics remain on main tab (steps, high scores etc), but no friends, badges etc in ""together"". Few days ago I reset my samsung password but this should not be the issue! Unacceptable.."
"After the latest update, some of the new format is good (steps and active times), but the summary data is now missing for blood sugar and blood pressure. You should make the summary format the same for the blood sugar and pressure as with steps and active time. Also, the net change on calories should be brought back."
"0 stars really. it should have an option to delete it completely. even the base un-updated version of it. it's just useless space filler, wasting precious megabytes on something useless. same as some of the other ""basic pack"" apps. ps. pasted & copied from another review, this is another of the useless apps. i understand its not useless for other people, just the same, it should havean option to delete it completely."
"App worked fine until latest update. Now sensor wont work to measure my stress level. Works fine to measure heart rate and o2 saturation. Cant be a problem with my phone as its a brand new samsung. Less than a month old. Like i said, app worked perfect until it updated today. Not happy."
This app is becoming less and less useful. As well as my previous reviews after the latest update the workout results graph is so feint it's unreadable. The previous graph had a clear line but now it's just a feint shadow.
I also loved the app but also can't get past the new verification. I've tried resetting my Samsung account password but it won't work. It says I've already reset it. The app keeps sending me to the Samsung account and there I can't do anything. I've been trying for a week.
"It's not connecting after the latest update Tried cleaning the cache, didn't work. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling, didn't work. It never connect. Looking for another app that I can use with my Active 2. Live in Brazil, cannot call to the number for assistance."
"Biggest concern I have is you cannot change nutritional intakes such as carbs, you can only alter calories. A simple change would help as not everyone's dietary needs are the same. For a health app though it's not too bad."
I refuse to use apps that force me into unnecessary permissions to use. Very sad for an otherwise good product. Since changing the app to force phone and call tracking the app rating has dropped from 3.9+ to 3.7 yet Samsung continues to tell us we have nothing to fear and all is OK. Maybe you should listen to your user base and remove unnecessary permissions or at latest switch to opt in.
"Hate the update. it keeps crashing on my phone. I've restarted my phone, cleared cash and forced stopped and it still crashes every time I open it on my Galaxy s9. Worked fine before the update, guess I'll have to find another app."
Good but needs water reminder. Should be pretty simple to add a drink water reminder to the water widget. It reminds me to do everything else why not that? Wasted money on to other paid apps that I thought would sync with my watch but they don't.
"I normally use Google apps but Samsung Health has Google Fit beat. I'm using a Galaxy Watch 4 so there's a bit of a homefield advantage but the amount of data and info I get from my runs is really impressive. I love how it also explains each of the items it tracks, and will even give you exercises to improve certain running metrics! Sleep tracking is also really neat and helps me know when I'm not getting a good night's sleep. Honestly, give Samsung Health a try. It seems like the team cares!"
"Was a great app, can't get it to function since the latest update. Beyond frustrating to lose all my data without warning. I hope I can find a decent replacement on the market."
The only reason I started to use this app religiously was because of the weight management feature. It was extremely helpful to reach weight goals and was an integral part of the app. Please reinstate this important feature.
"I have used this app for a while now to track pretty basic things. (Steps, food intake, weight) Now with this recent update it all of a sudden NEEDS to be able to use phone function. Good bye! There are other apps out there that can do the same thing without unnecessary permissions. Uninstalled and not coming back."
My phone was in the same pocket ad my boyfriends phone since mid night till now (3:20) we walked for 7kilometres and were at a party before that for several hours yet his phone recorded 10k steps which makes a lot more sense than the 5k steps your app recorded from the same pocket Also why can't i record exercises manually and add them in after i have finished them a feature tat most other apps offer. And another feature could be a calendar in which we could record or exercises by date
"Lose the two step authententication. Manage phone calls??? Are you kidding me? Regardless of your intentions not to share, not to track, not to record, perception is the reality. Please explain the purpose of this application requiring access to all my contacts. Until then, I cannot authorize you having access to them. I suggest you back out this change."
Best app ever. My friends and I are loving the competitions and other health benefits this app has helped us focus on. ‚ù§üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. * My only wish or suggestion is I would like to be able to add more than five friends to the monthly challenges.
"was working perfectly until yesterday, says it cannot open on a rooted device... my device is not rooted. uninstalled and tried to reinstall, and it said unauthorized changes were made to my device!!!! very disappointed. loved this app til now"
"Watch sucks, phone sucks, app sucks. Nothing syncs well, it isnt accurate, it was expensive... no support anywhere, website doesn't load, chat doesnt load, messages go unanswered. No phone number for customer support. Literally all around a bad brand and bad product. Just get an iPhone and an apple watch and save yourself the incredible headache of shotty products and even worse customer service. Returning 5 samsung watches and trading in 7 Samsung's for iphones today."
"I just downloaded the update, so I cannot tell you of any problems w/ the app yet. But one problem I have is, as a diabetic trying to lose weight I just purchased a Wyze Smart Scale & it would be super duper nice for their unit to communicate with Samsung Health. Could U please work on this? Update! I now just had gastric bypass & I have another app that links my scale & to my dr's which is google fit so it would be great instead of linking the scale to link Google fit & samsung health together."
"terrible performance since the update that changed interface. it does not record time and steps, the map is also become useless. for a 30 minute walk with 4800 steps it only recorded 1.22 minutes and a few hundred steps."
"Lovely app! Only recently have I had trouble linking up with MyFitnessPal. The problem was fixed within a day. Great work team! Using this app in conjunction with my Galaxy Active watch has given me consistent weight loss. All other methods that I have used to drop weight would have me yo-yoing With this, I enjoy walking more. Seeing it report my calories burned is so rewarding! I also love the social aspect of the app. The challenges make me want to walk even more! Thank you Samsung for giving me my body back!"
Good ap until they updated it to force you to give permission to access your phone's info and contacts. Don't bother trying to open the ap without giving the permission because you won't be able to. Ruined a perfectly good ap and made it useless. I wish I could give it negative stars.
"Just got the note 20 ultra..very good phone ...so far..but other if the features from the health app have been removed..no stress reading, oxygen level reading from the phone...why?.. makes no sense...I upgraded my phone and now as far as this app is concerned I get less features. I hope samsung will update those features back in2 the app."
"At a given time, the app shows more number of steps than the watch (current reading watch : 8938, App: 9663). Also the heart rate is NOT getting sync even though the watch is connected to the phone. Sleep monitoring is pathetic as while i was watching movie in theatre, the watch recorded sleep time for 2 hours. I am highly disappointed, its such a waste of money buying galaxy watch for ‚Çπ30000, there are products half the price with better response."
been using this app for about a year and worked great. but since the update the globe challenge doesn't work. won't sync. October one is still calculating and November didn't even start
"Like many other 1 star reviews, I have unistalled this app after the update wanted access to my contacts and other info on my phone. Non of this info has anthing to do with the funcationality of the app, its just more data harvesting. Samsung says its ok, your personal info is safe...baloney.....soory Samsung: change it or expect many more folks to unistall."
"This app is amazing! It makes getting and staying in shape so simple. There are so many free workout plan and guides to help someone who is just beginning their wellness journey. If you don't have this app, get it!"
"Good app for a freebie. Only question I have is this. When i run, i pause it for a rest stop. Does this count to the distance? I run the same track and so far two consecutive sessions have different times and finish points for the same 5km loop"
"Hi Thank you for the Samsung app, I just updated the software on my Samsung phone and Galaxy Watch today, but unlike the pictures shown in the software introduction section of the Google Store, I only have running apps in the fitness section ,and other apps doesn't show for me. what's the reason!? My phone's operating system is Android 6.0.1 and of course I live in Iran"
I loved this app until they took away the ability to check my pulse and O2 rates. Now they've taken away the feature that tracked my calories and showed what I needed for weight loss. This last update really stinks.
"I don't know what the problem is but I really wish this app could be fixed it constantly times out, closes and stops counting steps. I literally have to open it every 15 minutes so disappointing. It use to work perfectly."
The app displays weight incorrectly with a xiaomi mi scale 2. Instead of 72 kg it becomes720 kg. Please fix this. I tried to reset to no avail. Using another app corrects the problem so i thinj its a problem that occurred since the update. L
"Crashing fixed! Just go to device care and optimize the phone. Then clear cache and data, restart app, sync to account and we are good to go. Map/GPS is working and doesn't crash anymore. Thanks Samsung Health Team!"
"Helps me keep on track Few issues with step count data between galaxy wearable. Mixes up ""watch steps and ""phone steps"" then adds the two to make HUGE step count. Hope they fix this issue. I do love the app."
"App stopped working, claims phone is rooted. Phone isn't rooted. Other apps like samsung pay still work. Edit: An android update arrived that fixed it. Still very annoying especially since the error message was incorrect and unhelpful."
"The app is showing my walking activity but step count is zero. I am using fit2 smart band. The band is working fine, because it is showing step counts as well as other activities related data. I hope Samsung will fix the Samsung health app."
"I've had gear watch and I'm now so disappointed that my running activity is no longer syncing to runkeeper. Runkeeper had a record of which shoes I wore and the total miles. This is the information I need. I was planning on upgrading to Garmin, and it's.now definately on my Christmas list. Goodbye gear watch and samsung health."
So my comment got deleted so leaving it again... Both the app and Samsung gear stopped counting the steps properly.. for a 10k walk it registered over 2500 steps.. it's a massive shame as it worked perfectly up until last month. since the new update it doesn't record stuff properly which is a shame
"I love this app and my Samsung Galaxy watch amazing step tracker, weight tracker, calorie and water trackers along with other great features I haven't explored yet... Plus I love the together part so I can ""walk with friends"" either real life friends and other people using the app in the together challenges"
"If i could go back to whatever version you were running in July that would be awesome. Since July the app hasnt counted steps properly despite its many and constant updates. Was a great app, now it's a nuisance"
The Samsung health app was not receiving sleep stats from my galaxy watch 3. Thanks for your helpful and quick response. As per your recommendation I cleared the cache on the health app but I also had to uninstall the app from my phone. After the reinstall and data download from my backup the health app was receiving data from the watch. So now all is well again. Thank you
"they removed the spo2 which sucks, I know you're not supposed to use it has any type of diagnosis tool but it really worked when my oxygen was low I would be able to know, now I don't have that option. it was a discrete way to check it without pulling out my spo2 monitor looking like a weirdo in public. I'm 31 and only have about 70% function of my left lung."
"While most of what i use in the app is ok the ""stress test"" is still way less then accurate, it use to be close to spot-on. It tells me that my stress level is below average when i know for a fact its above the average reaching into the high levels some days."
"Unable to login. After I enter the credentials it just sits spinning trying to login. On the web I found a reference to skip the login, but that option is no longer available in the latest version. So at this point I can't use the app at all."
The weight management feature was the most beneficial feature of the app. But it's suddenly gone. I was finally gaining some weight loss momentum.
Definitely helps me keep my goals. With the easy tracking with my Samsung Galaxy Watch2 all workout tracking integration is so seemless. 10/10 would recommend for any and every workout. Here's to keeping goals!
"I am trying to use this app as I just got a Samsung watch and it wont let me open the app, says ""this service is unavailable at this time"" error. I have cleared cache, data, did a restart on my phone. Uninstalled and reinstalled the app. Nothing is working and I'm still getting the error. Super frustrating"
I used to love this app. Got out of my habits using it. Went to start fresh and the app is missing the weight management feature that balanced calories burned vs calories eaten. Was a 5 star app now of no use. Makes my Samsung smart watch less valuable to me. I wear it to monitor my activity levels.
"The app does not work on my phone. An error message pops up saying ""Can't be opened on a rooted phone"" I switched from a Fitbit to the Galaxy Active but now I can't even use the app. Please fix this!"
This app update sucks. I use a galaxy watch and I do not want my total steps to reflect my phone and watch but the option has been removed. I also connect my virgin pulse app to this to earn money through a work program and it subtracts my phone steps from my total because of the missing option of having just gear steps only. fix this please!!!!!!!!
Disappointed in the recent update. The weight management tool has been removed. I've used the app for the last 96 days and that was my most used tool. Please bring this tool back. I've lost 30 pounds as of today and I owe that loss to the weight management tool.
"Even if you turn auto-pause on workouts off using the app, the watch still auto-pauses (so it won't record you using a stroller because it pauses if your hand is still). Also, if you pay $300 for a watch, there shouldn't be ads in the app."
Still not syncing properly with Strava. I followed your instructions. No change. I am told that Strava only allows so many attempted syncs per day and SHealth exceeds that limit and gets locked out.
This used to be a great app and I used it almost every day until the last update when forced to allow access to phone and contacts. I uninstalled it and will look for an alternative android app. Samsung you're starting to really suck!
"The App is ok, but this is infuriating to own a flagship Galaxy S* model and still have in app ads about Samsung products. Even with ads settings off in the app + ads opted out on my Samsung profile, you still see on top the 2 ads... I found online many people in the same situation. Guys, please, good app, but I'm tired of having a nice Galaxy S* phone and still seing Samsung Ads in a Samsung App... At least leave us the option to fully deactivate them... Moving to Google Fit..."
Easy to use app. Can't keep from looking at it every time I hold phone and boost up to be active. Love one on one challenges to make walking more fun and connected with peers. Would be awesome to have group challenges and gym challenges too.
"App is really great at providing your exercise activity. However, the recent update does not have the correct calorie count. I also like that it links to several different activity apps."
"I really enjoy the app. Logging and tracking my daily habits has been prevalent im me maintaining weight, however i would appreciate an easier way to log food like a barcode scanner and have the foods in the search panel not so limited."
"I liked the previous version with more information. This update has another problem that is not transferring/showing the route information from Samsung gear sport to Samsung health app.  I can see other information about walk time, heart rate etc but the route is only available on gear sport but not in the app.  Whats going on here?"
Disappointing app from Samsung considering the price point for their fitness gadgets. I would like the option to pick my country for competitions. Also health data is extremely basic I expected more from the techies at Samsung. Wish I would have gotten a Fitbit instead.
"I was told I needed to lose weight before surgery. I stumbled upon this app, and I not only lost the required weight, I have lost 40lbs. and have kept it off. I have solely used this app as a challenge and guide, together with willpower it has worked far beyond my expectations."
The app is fine but not up to standard. The app doesn't display info in an easy to read way and doesn't show as much info as I can see on my samsung watch. The family options are also really bad to.
Step yracker quit syncing with app. The steps are about 50% less of what they should be. I use another tracker to check it and did a comparison with a friend and it is off. Poor choice!!!
app is really great but the latest update forces the step count to show on the notification bar though it is turned off in the app. Also once i open the app and turn the notification on then the step couny goes but then a new notification pops up for batter usage and i have to force stop the app to remove from notification bar. please fix this
"The app is ok; however, it is crippled by the fact that it's impossible to log in to. It requires a captcha to login, but refuses to let me login, no matter what captcha I enter. This is frustrating and defeats the purpose of having the app in the first place.."
"Overall ok but the list of activities isn't practical at all on the spot. I do not want to initiate 'plank' for 2min, then 'squats' for another 2min...etc And for the presets, there isn't a HIIT setting.. some may not care but I sure do..."
"It is a great app, however, for some reasons these days, it has stopped to count my steps in real time. It gives updates after an average of 5mins and can be very frustrating depending on what I'm working on."
"The app is very helpful for tracking your steps. using since last year. However since updation of Samsung OS, it has started malfunctioning. It stopping continuously and I could not even see my progress. Dear Samsung team, please do something for my favourite app."
"Awesome app. GREAT for tracking all kinds of activities. GREAT for keeping one motivated. AWESOME stats on you daily, weekly and monthly progress. Can't recommend it high enough. 5 STARS. : )"
"First, it forced me to log-in to Samsung, this turned on all sorts of pre-installed nagware popups and useless GUI buttons. Second, now the Samsung Health app wants to ""manage my phone calls"". I don't want to use TFA or whatever your greedy data-mining cause may be. Time to uninstall... also, next phone will not be a Samsung!"
"Much less useful since loss of the weight management portion of the app. Would never have latched on to the Samsung Health app without it, probably would never have gotten the watch. VERY DISAPPOINTED in this loss."
The last 2 updates have let to unreliability and even clearing the cache as suggested on other reviews with similar problems. It continues to be an issue. Really poor product if you truly trying to use this for a health tracker.
"Since the new App update. While on Running mode, the Audio Guide gives inaccurate information about Speed & Pace. This needs to be rectified since in the previous version it was working correctly."
"Im not happy with the recent permission changes, I don't want to give access to my contacts or phone calls, etc... but I can't use the app unless I do. Whatever the feature that requires this permission is not something I want to use but now I can't use the entire app."
"I am so disappointed with Samsung Health. I have been a Fitbit user for 2 years and recently purchased the new Samsung Active 2 watch, which uses this app. It is so much less user friendly than Fitbit. I've never used apple but from what my apple user friends say, it's far inferior to their app as well. Specifically for tracking fitness, both the app and widget on my watch are difficult to use. It is so limited on choices of workout types, specifically aerobic group fitness type workouts."
Nice app and seems to be working well so far. My current issue is Samsung Health doesn't record oxygen levels during sleep. The phone app informs me this can be turned on in the watch settings for Samsung Health app. I checked everywhere in the watch app settings and there is no option for this. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
"Similar to several other recent reviews, with the most recent update, it has lost the ability to sync with 3rd party apps even with permissions enabled. Frustrating."
Since 2 months the App is not functioning properly. I run 5 kms but it shows 1.5 km only. When u click running button it calculates 1 kms after i run 3.4 kms. On auto mode its ok.. but then notifications dont come. Earlier it used to work fine.
"I enjoy this app alot. My biggest negative is that the group walking competition has alot of fake accounts. This is a feature I love and I try walk as much as i can because of it. However, 1st place is always an unreachable goal which upsets me :("
Everything is fantastic. I would like to see more graphic illustrations and improvements on the weight loss tab and step count trends but as a whole this app is a game changer.
With weight management feature being removed after the last update the app lost a good functionality. If this feature is not returned I'll consider moving to alternative app. I almost don't see new practical benefits from the update.
Bought a gearfit pro 2 and used this app .main reason i bought it was for swimming .unfortunatlly i dont own a 20m pool so its useless no option to change cant sync the swiming with this app because of this.had to use a 3rd party app by speedo which doesnt sync with this app have to put the data in manually and is also very u reliable.now with the latest update i am congratulated by my phone for going to sleep waking up and endless pointless notifications its turned into a childrens toy and nothing else .why not make the app more usefull with actual fitness optiond rather than the people working on it doing these pointless updates
"I would like to see it connect to Flo directly and to the fitbit user community. A big minus is that you cannot set individual nutritional plans (keto, low carb, or other). Otherwise it fully fulfills my needs."
The new update doesn't allow for my Data Permissions to be added. I use an app AlwaysOn and it is supposed to sync with each other. After this update it's like it was deleted from there and now can't be added.
"I cant swipe away the steps notification. I like a clean notification bar. If i cant swipe away a notification then i am forced to disable them completely, which is not ideal. Please change this. I don't want any permanent unswipable notifications."
This app doesn't have my omron blood pressure monitor as a listed device. I also think that the sleep tracking portion of the app needs a make over. The app says that it will track the number of floors but it never has. Lastly I keep having to remove and re-add my blood glucose meter.
Absolutly terrible! Not able to get past the two step verification! I put in the code that was sent to my phone but after i finished it wouldnt let me hit the verify button. Would not recomend. NEEDS TO BE FIXED!
It will not start because it needs permission to make phone calls! I will not allow access. No I dont use this together feature so I dont need a unique ID. Now the app is useless as it wont open. I already having problems with my samsung watch and now you make your brand even worse by application annoyances. Bravo.
I dont no what the hell happened 2 this app but it stopped working a few months ago due to the latest update it will not load at all & it keeps telling me that my Galaxy S9+ is rooted & the app cannot be used but it's not rooted at all it was working perfectly fine when I had Android Oreo but when I upgraded 2 Android Pie I am getting all sorts of errors this app became zero functional I no Im not the only one having this issue people with an S9/S9+ are having the same problem please fix itüò°üëé
"Great app. I really enjoy it. It was a little difficult to figure how to link ""friends"" with otjer S Health users but we got it after a while. I love the challenges and the little world map, it's cute & motivating."
"Very inconsistent data . Bought galaxy 3 LTE in Nov begining . It takes a lot of time to get updated from the watch post workout , it's super inconsistent whimsical behaviour is hard to rely upon .sleep data either has consistent gaps or outrightly absent even though I wear galaxy 3 watch on my wrist through the night.very disappointing. More over during the sale I was told that there is blood pressure monitoring and ECG available after I started using its not there,there is no ECG or BP option"
I really liked the SpO2 measurement feature. It was removed. I was thinking may be in near future the feature will be back with updates but no luck yet. Really bad. I didn't expect this from Samsung.
It' has been a good app but it it behaving erratic since last few days. There is problem in proper syncing of data with my Samsung Gear 3. The data picked by the app differs vastly from that recorded on the Samsung watch.
"I was really enjoying the app the experience is amazing but since last few days I'm not able to open the app it shows that my phone is rooted and app cannot be opened, but my phone is not rooted and the app is running in the background always but not opening if I try to open it gives the notifications and counts my steps but not opening when I try to open it. I'm using galaxy note 8 on one UI which is not rooted. kindly provide solution. thanks"
Updated : Decided to uninstall. Since the latest update I find it's not as user friendly n sensitive to clock my steps when I put at the side pocket of my bag compared to previously.... Frustrating! There are times when they didn't even capture the steps. Pls look into it.
I always use the discover tab to listen to music to relax myself and allow for better sleep and it helps A LOT... but just today when I open it is says no items and nothing that was there before is there. I hope this is a temporary bug and hopefully its resolved by tomorrow night.
I have used this app on non-samsung phones for years. lost weight and was staying healthy. last up date demanded two step security and now I cannot get into the app even after reseting password and logging in from my laptop to fix it. Says I need Samsung account login which I cannot get on non-samsung phone. UPDATE: Tried developer directions and still the app will not allow a sign in. after agreeing it says Samsung Account session expired. sign in to Samsung account again which I cannot get on a NON-Samsung device.
"LOVED this app even purchased a smart watch to use with it. At least that was until a few days ago when the weight and calorie management feature disappeared.. sucks cause this feature really gave me that extra little needed push, not sure why to even use the app now. :( highly disappointed"
"Access too all - no choice. How about listening to the users and giving us a choice? I also would like to endorsed the idea of dropping Samsung health related hardware as long as Samsung is this invasive. Now I'm only using my Samsung watch to show the time. Samsung, don't bother with your standard user careless answer. Action is required!!!"
"Samsung Health exercise activities don't sync with Strava. I use a Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 and record my activity with Samsung Health. I also use a Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 with latest Strava and Samsung Health apps running. For some irritating reason, the Samsung Health activities sync very intermittently with my Strava app. I never know when or why it does not sync. Any advice?"
"I've used this app to keep track of steps. It seemed ok. Today I tried to use it while I went jogging. The map that showed my route wasn't even close! Instead of showing my route, it showed me going B line to and from my house."
Cannot log into app. After typing in Name & password it just hangs with spinning wheel. I tried all of the following to no avail... Resetting password. Restarting phone. Deleting & reinstalling app. Deleting data. Deleting cache. Creating a new account. Settings up two step verification.
I used to love this app. But to need permission to have total access to everything over and over then never opening up past the terms of service because it needs more permission to access my phone. It's on a tablet and not a phone. Get it together Samsung
I have bought A52 with which this app was pre-installed. It is pre-installed good app but only drawback is I am not able connect my Cross beat Orbit smartwatch data with it so my workout is synced with Samsung Health so you are requested to do some concret so that data from other fitness apps gets synced.
"It was great until recent uodate. There is no reason on earth that this app requires access to my phone calls, contacts etc and isnt getting it.. It worked perfectly fine before hand.. It also qants me to set up two factor verification -"
Generally a very good health app! I'm happy that it's able to synce well with Strava and even Google Fit. It's very useful with tracking your fitness progress in the long term. The app looks good and is fun to use! Recommended
My experience using this app is good however they keep updating and changing the functions now I can't record my coffee or the weight management which I found really useful because it allowed you to workout and burn what you had eaten üòè can you please put an option to have it back please
"The Weight Management Widget in previous version has helped me lose 5kg, I'm just halfway through my weight loss journey. Then, they took away the widget without notice. As you can see from tons of users feedback who are not happy with the change. I'm curious to know what was Samsung thinking? I will give it 5 star if we can get the widget back."
Useless after update! The app used to be a handy tracker but after the last update the best feature has disappeared - weight management. For this reason any Samsung fitness bands and smart watches cannot be recommended.
The only thing I would change would be to ADD a upc scanning option to count calories. UPDATE I would also like for carbs to be counted correctly. For example to get NET CARBS you minus the dietary fiber and some sugars. For people on specific diets ( who isn't right?? ) This would be very helpful
"I liked it before the latest update. The required 2FA set up is broken. I am able to get the code, but after I enter the code there is no way to advance to the next screen, neither the keyboard enter button nor the on screen next page button works. Update: wow that samsung response I got was incredibly unhelpful. The app is broken. I got the texted code, but I cannot get past the verify code screen, the verify button will not light up after the code is entered and I cannot continue beyond that page."
"Why did you change this application! The big lemon means nothing and takes up so much space. Where before one screen I used to be able to easily see my grams of protein, carb and fat content and percentages. Now I can only see protein if a click on to a diffrent screen and there is no place at all that shows total grams of carbs, given how many diet plans focus on macros and carb gram conting is a huge error. This update is TERRIBLE! Please return it to older version"
Love it! I use it every day. It would be nice to see a nap time üò¥ feature added to the sleep log in future upgrades. That way occasional naps could be included with records of hours total slept. üòä
"App doesn't function well after this October update. Have to close out of the app entirely and reopen to add different food items. App is slow to load Together challenges and, just slow in general to load. Missing the floors counter."
"everything is great. just, one issue. It records the wrong times for meals, set by gear s3 classic. I can go in fix it, but that is just LAME... please fix. I'll give you the 5th üåü."
"This used to be an amazing app, I was super happy about. But the removal of the weight management feature in the last update makes the app useless. Samsung I would really like you to bring the best feature of your app back, please."
"I live the app because it helos me keep track of both the mileage I ride and how much walking I do, but i dont like the recent up date because it would automatically start counting my steps which I think is great, but i could also track my riding i do and since i updated it this morning it does not keep track of my riding i did today like it use to please fix this issue, because being able to run 2 things on Samsung health at the same time is cool."
"Update: the last update solved the sign-in issue, but it was still over a month without access to my information. And now they want permission to make phone calls. App niw forces 2 step verification, and then it won't even load. I absolutely hate this app and will not be purchasing any more samsung products"
"Amazing health app. Dark theme finally ! Much better than Google Fit. It has over 500 million users ! I challenge my friends daily. I even bought a Samsung Fit smartband to get accurate steps count and sleep data and heart rate. I use it as my main health app and I sync from it to other sports tracking apps. Thank you, Samsung ! üíØüëåü•∞‚ú®"
"Do not download the new update. I have tried everything samsung has mentioned to login and still can't, even when trying to use my google account. And after attempting that and getting locked out, it's now telling me my saved passwords on my phone have all been conpromised."
"Previous version is much better. Dashboard is clear. New version look not professional, dashboard does not look like dashboard. Problem link to 3rd party apps, require developer mode rights to change. Bad user experience for me."
App keeps crashing complaining about my phone being rooted even though it's not rooted. This app does not work well unless you allow it access to your contacts. Update: contacts issue fixed with an update.
"I just updated the app.and now it doesn't track weekly weight management analysis and weight management details have been removed, I counted on this to help me lose weight I am very disappointed in the new update, is there anyway to remove the latest update.i use to love the app over fitbit.now app continually crashes when I try to open the food section of app"
Great in a lot of ways but they really need to have users be able to transfer their data to a new phone. Even when it's another Samsung phone you can't see any of your previous data. You have to start a clean slate Everytime
"i love the app but it's so frustrating that it fails to sync with Strava. when i first paired the apps it worked fine, then it would only sync at 2am each day and now it fails to sync at all."
Have used this app for years but suddenly it's not working properly. The daily step tallies disappear overnight which renders all history useless. Would really like it fixed otherwise will need to purchase a Fitbit or some such.
"It's OK, I suppose but I only got it for the step counter. Does that well when it works but randomly (about once a week on average) it fails to register that I've started walking - at the end of the day it tells me I've only done 127 steps. Not bothered enough to persist with it."
The only thing worth it on this app was the running and audio guides telling you your 1 or 1/2 mile splits etc. The Audio Guide has stopped working now. MyFitnessPal is better for food tracking. There's now no reason to use this app.
facing issues since last update almost a week ago.. before if i forgot or i don't log in my food intake it just automatically asign calories based on the total calorie intake i've set. also when i weigh in and log new weight it gives notification of how much weight loss from last weigh in. now after the update it doesn't do these anymore. help.
"Switched phones and now I can't log in despite multiple attempts, and several security codes sent to me via SMS that the app didn't even let me enter. Very unfortunate, my only choice now is to uninstall and switch to a competitor app."
I used to love this app for the weight management side. It helped me a lot in my weight loss journey a few years ago and now I finally return and it's been deleted? This app is pretty pointless now. Might as well get MyFitnessPal or another app..
"Love it! Only downside is that I don't carry my phone at work, so it would be handy to have a function that allows you to add additional steps ie my fitbit says 12200 steps, samsung says 8500 steps...input 3700 steps, doesn't have to count towards the challenge steps but would make weight and food tracking easier"
"this update does not work at all on my phone. at least 5x a day i get messages to close the app, or wait. it used to work just fine. it's been frustrating because nothing is syncing anymore."
Great app there are a few things it needs. The Fitbit app allows you to check your heart rate instantly through the app and adding the ability to actually communicate with others would make it more like a community and less of a competition.
It's always showing on notification but with zero steps even when my google fit has counted more than 10k. It only starts counting when I open the app and keep it running otherwise it doesn't in the background. Disappointing.:(
"This was a great app for a long time until it recently required access to my contacts and phone, I have deleted it and will not be using it anymore. Samsung we don't trust your explanation, should allow an opt out feature."
This is a very helpfull. Daily workouters can try it. You can calculate your daily exercise and manage it in this app. Also you can participate in the global challenge in every month. Let's workout togetherü§©. Also it can track your sleeping time and you can also manage it. Great app.
"This site crashed on me and I lost all data as I had to reinstall The sleeptimer is ok but feel like I have to argue with it Definitely do not like the grey time button,used to use it but now is hard to turn on,like the last version,just ha e a slide button ?!!!!@"
I love this App! I have my phone with me all the time counting my steps and keeping track of my sleeping patterns and water intake. I love challenging friends to stay on track with their health and exercise too. Samsung Health is a great way to stay on track and have a bit of fun with friends.
Excellent. However challenges are not updated at the same day and can take ages sometimes to show up. Also when moving from one to other device they are not moved with full details.
"Good app but my suggestion is really need shortcuts or widgets for record Health activities Ex. drinking water ,adding food ,exercise etc., because every time find this app and go to add manually,it's really hard, sometimes I missed or forgot to record my activities.otherwise it's Good App."
"For me, I have tried several health apps and I was truly happy with you guys but this recent update has pissed me off. August 1, I kicked off an exercise regimen that I am so, so proud of but my achievements, badgets, stars, data, etc is not found. I hate it."
"it's hard to navigate, and figure out. when trying to pull up my weight loss and see how I've been doing it keeps running me in circles,an when I try to set new goals it wont let me."
"Doesn't sync correctly with my fitness pal when I've copied a meal from a friend, only a 1/3 of the calories sync? Also duplicate measurements on weight due to MFP and health mate connected need some AI here. Hba1c reading doesn't export to pdf either. Other than that OK at the moment."
"I love how this app keeps me motivated by being contacted with others doing the monthly and individual challenges. I've had this app for a while, but within the last month in half really have started utilizing all its tools to step up activity levels."
"Worst watch (Galaxy) and app combo ever! Sometime it doesn't even track walks, runs, swims or cycles. Floors doesn't work. Samsung really have flopped on going it alone, and lost a customer. It's such a shame given the cost!"
"Keeps shutting down when i open anything with a map download, such as setting up a walk/run, or checking recent walk/runs with map download. I use this feature daily so i sure hope someone sends a bug fix update"
"What is the point of tracking things if you have no tangible goals to work towards? The analytics is terrible, the weight management features and other trackers which made samsung health so robust are all gone.What am I supposed to do with looking at steps my friends took when my own body goals are gone ? The food trackers is gone am I supposed to estimate every time I eat? This is the highest level of dissapoinment from samsung.Please sack whosever idea this was and get it back to what it was."
I don't like it because when your playing a game or just on your phone browsing a black screen pops up and takes 1 second to dissaper.i don't know if that's for me only but it's very distracting and it says get more active even if you take a rest or setting.
Amazing! Works well with my Active 2. Heart rate monitor works well and a recent update displays my running stats in depth. I love the challenges and seeing my stats. Would highly recommend.
"The app used to automatically record my sleep time without the use of any accessories, but for a few months it has stopped and I'm not able to get it to work again! Really disappointed as it was the most useful feature for me"
"Complication on Wear3 does not seem to work properly: Example for heartrate: no icon provided, no text with the value of measure. It just displays ""Heart rate"" static text. Same goes for other datas (sleep, body comp, etc...)"
"It was a GREAT app before the update. Now nutrition data and the meal data is either gone or hard to find. Go back to the prior version, it was perfect! Will not use if left as is."
"The fact that you can ONLY use this app in conjuction with The Galaxy Watch 3, is very disappointing. Thats a watch that is over ¬£400. Surely there must be something that is more affordable to make this app work for the sleep function and other parts. Must admit. A little disappointed so far with what I can fo without the watch."
This would be better if you separated steps between my watch and the phone. All its doing is counting 2 steps for 1. The watch and phone need to be able to be separated for step counts. It shouldn't even be reading the steps from the phone when a watch is connected.
"The one thing that annoys me about this app is I know I walk alot more then it says I do. It partially tracks my workouts. The calculator for distance I've set it umpteenth times and it always goes back to default. I live in Canada I dont get Imperial math ( miles, gallons, and pounds) . I know kms, litres and kilograms. ."
"It wrongly detects steps and floor counts.I know pedometer does read faulty steps count while on a vehicle. How to stop auto step detection for sometime. Why dont you use machine learning to predict it. Simple cross check with user(training data) and improve result. Let the app ask if I am really walking or in a vehicle? Ask when usually I should be on a vehicle. If you cant do machine learning, allow me to join your R&D team else put option to pause auto detection OR manually delete data."
"I've been using this app for a long time and I was really happy because it helped me a lot. I was really motivated. But now, you have changed it. Before, you could reach a first goal when you walked 60 minutes and another when you got to the number of steps you set as a goal. Now when you reach the number of steps YOU CHOOSE, you are told that you did not reach your target goal! You decided to establish 90 minutes as the only target. Why?? We all have different needs, you should respect that."
"I had to bring my rating down from 5 stars because the update has gotten rid of Weight Management, the most useful part of the app! I'm sad because i love this app and how integrated it was and don't want to have to switch to another one but that is a really key feature I can't do without."
"Just wanted to assure Samsung that this app does indeed have ads! At the time of this writing there are 6 ads that cycle through the top third of the screen while using the app. Nice try gaslighting us, though, Samsung."
its motivating and interactive. I enjoy using the app. i just hate the in accuracy and being unable to edit a program. i ran one day and the program said i was unfinished and didnt let me jusy click done amd record my results.
"Stress meter cannot be trusted; I'm often under a lot of stress but the stress rating can be anywhere from high to low, with no real correlation. Further part of the review removed since the mentioned feature was re-added, but still rating a bit low due to the inaccuracy of the stress meter."
I have rrcently moved all my activities over to S health. It is awesome to have 1 app for eveeything. There are a few anoyances i'm working though but all and all a good app. My big annoyance at the moment is the fact that my Calories are almost half for the same excersize and time is this a calculatuon error?
Samsung Health longer allows fitbit so sync # steps whatsoever. I will be stopping to use Samsung Health and move completely to fitbit in this case. Update: Samsung responded to my review with a completely useless and generic reply that was full of grammatical errors.
Was enjoying the app until forced two factor authentication and now required phone permissions. There are many ways to get a unique identifier without needing access to the phone call permissions (samsung account?). Time to find a new smart watch and maybe will switch phones.
"Worthless now without additional technology. I really liked using the sensor on my phone camera for oxygen and heart rate, now it doesn't work without purchasing additional technology like a watch. I would uninstall, but Samsung doesn't let you do that either. Way to take an app I liked and ruin it."
"Not only permissions to mange calls, you must have 2-factor authentication. Although Samsung team says we want share your data with anyone we just collected for better experience, ok I'am fine to the regular experience. Please stop asking permissions to track everything. It's my decision if I want to use these features that require extra permissions. Never force me! Will stop using the app until the next update."
"I never write reviews, but after buying a galaxy watch I have had nothing but problems connecting samsung health to any 3rd party app. My fitness pal, stravia, google fit, etc... It seems like Samsung is not addressing bugs in their app. I've found multiple other reviews saying the same."
"A nice enjoyable app.with nice clear details..but I wish on the steps and other stuff there was more details in the weekly and monthly stats. even on veryfit pro it gives a weekly total off steps and calories burnt, and miles walked for the week or month.not just the average"
"I am using this application for 7 years or more. But the new development is terrible. I always tracked my lose weight by months. However, it shows only daily changes."
"It works well before. Lately after updating the app, it keeps asking me to do the two steps verification even though I completed it again and again. I tried to uninstall and reinstall again, it still repeat the same problem. Pls fix it."
heart rate and sleep quality display for prior days is not as useful as it could be. the Fitbit app does a much better job of handling and displaying the data. hopefully this can be improved in future updates.
The new Samsung update made this app stop functioning properly. The pedometer is way off along with the timeline. Please fix asap! My phone is 3 months old. Tried to delete and redownload but did not fix the problem.
Used to connect with Strava via Facebook. Know my passwords are correct. Uninstalling and reinstalling doesn't fix it. review 2. Managed to link but none of the rides upload to strava. Read your reviews and see what people are saying. you need to update this app so it syncs as soon as a run or ride is completed. put me off Samsung's. I'll go back to iPhone next year
"Absolutely will not connect to Myfitnesspal. When pressing ""connect"" it just gives you the option to select ""cancel"" or ""done"" and that's it. It never connects."
"I don't like the new color update. With the greens chosen, when I go to view my health/food intake, the nutrition bar showing carbs/fats/proteins isn't different enough to be able to see the balance."
"It seems to have a glitch as the app is not counting steps correctly. Rather give us older versions back please, this 1 is not optimized. Update: Followed your feedback ... working 100% again. Thank you."
"Pathetic app/hardware. Step counter generally have no idea what is going on. I'm in a bus or on a bicycle and it keep counting steps. Unable to autodetect outdoor bicycle rides. My last ride was autodetected as 2 walk and 2 run sessions. I run at 30 km/h. Viva Samsung, I'm Olympic champion then?"
"The recent update now requires more clicks just to get to the exercise that i want to do. Please have an option to show the items as 3-columns again. Another suggestion, please add a setting to prevent the phone from sleeping when doing duration target exercises."
"The app is no doubt one of the best fitness tracking app. I have a suggestion, kindly add steps audio guide also apart from kms, mins and hours. I think for every 1000 steps the app can announce this. It would be helpful for all who target steps."
this is fun. I always finish the challenges and challenge my friends who have it to 50k step challenges. it keeps us all going instead of sitting like Americans. easy to use. the food tracker is helpful sometimes but i use it more out of curiosity.
"No stones (majority of UK users use this measurement still) in unit of measurement. only kg and lb. This seems woefully shortsighted as all other companies apps feature this (garmin, polar, Google fit etc ) Customer support replied I should clear my cache when I asked! I can convert my weight using a online calculator but this is such an uneccessary step. I'm forced to use a syncing app to transfer everything to Google Fit for until it becomes actually useful."
"I've been using this app for over a year, but now it says it's incompatible with my device (Samsung S5) and will not sync with my fitness app. It's frustrating to have an update make this app useless for many existing users."
There are a few features that could be better. Apple fit allows you to scan the bar code on food items food log them into you meal plan.my samsung watch and phone exercise data do not sync but the steps do. I wish I could challenge no samsung users through the app.
"Pro: keeps all your health tracking info in one place. Con: when exporting data, some of the components (e.g. Blood Glucose) only allow you to save summaries, not details. So I can't send individual readings to my doctor easily."
"Has stopped syncing with my Samsung Galaxy watch, says no device connected each time I try. Use to be great and watch and phone matched all the time. But the last few days all the watch data has not transferred to the app...."
"I've used this app for a number of years and it's been great, but now it's misbehaving. It is pausing when I'm not paused, giving me spurious distance and time messages and has become unreliable. It updated recently, what has gone wrong?"
"I just want an spp to track my steps. After deinstalling and reinstalling, it was different and a complicated. The app forced me to sccept marketing material and wanted to manage my phone calls. I hit deny and decided to uninstall the Samsung Health app. Geez, i just needed a simple pedometer to track steps and heart rate. The old app was NOT so complicated-- bring back the old app and maybe i might consider using it again."
"I absolutley LOVED this app until this update. Now I can't access anything unless I give access my phone the app says to make calls, the dev responses all say it's not to make calls but that is to verify ID for ""together"" a part of the app I don't even use because it's only for my personal tracking. It should definitely not be required to access my already entered data and steps from last 5+yrs. I guess I'll be finding a new tracker until they get their ish together. VERY DISAPPOINTED Samsung üòû"
"Boring app. I've been using garmin connect app and watch for 5 years. My husband got me the Samsung active 2 for Christmas. Love the watch so far, but the health app seem so ole school. Need to be more user-friendly with an updated vibe. I'm hoping after a month or so I'll have grown into liking the app. Frustrated!!!"
"Nonsence. Of course they are not going to say Yes we need all your permissions via take control of phone calls?? A functioning app should depending on its application, only need storage and maybe sms. What if people such as myself, dont want to share this info with the world and samsung?? You try to integrate the ""friends comparison"" as a diversion technique in order to gain other information. I know your agendas. I have flip fone that tracks steps with no gps(location) needed. Explain that"
The app is super but there always room for improvement. If the app allowed us to track and customize macros and meals and allow us to add food with barcodes it would blow any other fitness and calorie tracking apps away.
"This used to be 5 stars. Just upgraded to S20+ now some features like Strees, Heart rate and blood oxygen will not let me record values. Not impressed as I used this app a lot and has never let me down. Can you contact via email as this is still not working."
"Doesn't sync well with Galaxy Watch. Not all steps are recorded, sleep is inaccurate, not a good app. Get a Fitbit and use the fitbit app. More reliable and way more user friendly!"
"I would have given 5‚òÜ rating but the new update took away ""Weight Control"" which allows me to keep track of how many calories I need to make up each day. I still use the app every day but I would like that option returned with next update. Thank you."
"Worked fine with my galaxy fit, but now in the last couple of weeks it can't seem to stay synced and sleep/HR data doesn't get recorded. Nothing besides step data is working with the app with any consistency"
"This app is getting a lot of hate mainly for the interface, but honestly there isn't many apps I know of that have all the features that this app has, the only thing I recommend is updating the food logs, because it seems to be missing a lot, and to maybe add some way to customize your intake Goals like iron and vitamins."
Good app but would be amazing if you put in other options other than walking. Would love to see a squat challenge you could do with friends as well! Disappointing that you can only do walking üò¢
Having a samsung watch that pairs easily & well with this app is great. But I wish that you could search for exercise programs & decide when you do them based on your schedule & not what the programs dictate. That seems so ridiculous.
I have just installed the app again. I want to ask how to count steps when you moving around in home and working some kitchen stuff and moping. As you cant take mobile every time you move around. So kindly add some daily routine house works in the workout menu. Thankyou
"Its ok but not that user friendly. Deleting exercises is difficult. Update. I live in the UK. USA number is no good to me. Just improve the app. Look at Garmin Connect, user friendly."
"Love this app. I use it all the time. My family and I are very active and we all use this app every day for food ,exercise, water intake and more. I love the monthly challenges. I appreciate your hard work Samsung Health employees. Keep up the good work. Sorry about the comment about people cheating on challenges. I know your working hard to eliminate the problem."
"The app is a great app, and it has improved quite a bit. Is there any way you could add CrossFit to your list of workouts in the app. I gomtoncrossfit at least 3 days week and I would like to be able to use the app to track my fitness. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you."
"I don't understand why you will need to run ad on a massive banner on the top when users pays hundreds of pounds for your smart watches. It completely ruined the experience, too greedy ! Also, the new update is not an improvement but an downgrade."
"Keeps crashing all the time Tried clearing cache: doesn't solve the problem. As soon as the app tries to sync with Galaxy Watch it freezes / crashes. I refuse to call internationally for support, what are you thinking?"
What s motivational tool. This app gives just enough bio feedback data to keep it fun and interesting. The world global challenges are refreshing. Samsung hits a home run. Works perfect with Galaxy Note and Galaxy Watch.
The app is syncing incorrectly with my Galaxy Fit. For example if I have 6719 steps on my tracker the app shows me 6652. I can't save the manually set sleep. If I tap the save button nothing happens.
"Unable to use Heart rate sensor blood oxygen level stress level, On Galaxy S20 ultra, Don't seem to have a sensor anymore!! It works fine with my other phones I'm thinking it might be the ultra. Besides steps, does this app work on S20 ultra, My question was answered it is the phone it doesn't have a sensor anymore From S10 plus up That's a shame On Samsung's behalfüòîüòîüòî"
Loving the app as recently got a samsung watch which I love. But would love to see the option of a barcode scanner to add food in my log would make if so much easier and quicker instead of scrolling down the list.
"I was out hiking where there is no signal, and I couldn't open the app to check my pulse. Pulse checking should be allowed without a phone signal. It should be stored, then uploaded when the phone signal returns."
"After last Android update on my Galaxy A50, a week ago, the voice in the app starts to talk in English with strong asiatish accent. It is really unpleasent and there is no option to change it. Before that the language was fluent British English. Please check it and fix it, because my phone sounds like cheap chinese health tracker."
"Had to do the update because it would no longer sync with my Galaxy watch, now I can't even sign in to my account when opening the app. I tried clearing the cache and force stopping the app. I don't know what you did but you need to undo it."
The ability to combine sleep records would be nice. If I wake up in the night it records as 2 separate records instead of one. Being able to merge those would help see overall sleep patterns.
"5 Stars up to now, 1 star and uninstall if they really do remove wright tracking. Please do not remove weight tracking!!! I have been putting my weight data in it since 2015! At least add an export feature so that we can continue on other apps. This app with its sleep&activity&weight tracking was my only motivation to buy a Samsung wearable device. You are somehow pushing me to get out of Samsung ecosystem."
"In general good expirience app gives motivation, works without big bugs, map somehow does not show after running or similar training, maybe it does not have that option anymore or I had some problem wih my gps...... After latest update works very good no problems like before!"
"I have started my weigh loss journey and Samsung Health has been a huge help. I use it to monitor my calorie intake and calorie burned. I know it isn't accurate, but it helps having a projection. The exercise programs suggested are very helpful and doable too"
UPDATE: Thanks for the quick response. I had gone online and found that if I skipped the signing in and then added my profile once I went into the app it worked. Sorted thank you. I'm trying to log into my Samsung account. I've added my verification code and then it just buffers.
PLEASE FIX This app use to be perfect but now the food / nutrition section is horrible. Does not list total carbohydrates anymore. I am a diabetic and need this to plan my meals. I CALLED THE HELP LINE AND THEY SAID THEY WERE SORRY. HOW CAN YOU REMOVE CARBOHYDRATES FROM A FOOD TRACKING APP.
"Honestly, the newest update convinced me to not buy Samsung hardware anymore. I have an active2 watch and only used this app as a more confortable way to see my stats and exercises than the watch's tiny screen. For some reason now I need an effing account just to open the app. I'm not creating yet another account just for you Samsung, so now this app is completely unusable. I'm sure the marketing people will come up with all sorts of bs excuses like ""improve experience"" or whatever. All bs"
"since i updated my galaxy, the app keeps popping up this message that says it cannot run on a rooted phone - my phones not rooted, it just updated? had to uninstall because popup was appearing every 20 seconds even when i wasnt in the app. shame because i loved it."
"Features keep changing or being discontinued. Last straw is now it longer syncs sleep data from Galaxy Active 2 watch. watch is tracking sleep, but app won't show it and watch ""Couldn't get sleep data from your phone."""
"Not sure what has happened, but my app just updated itself 2 days ago and my first gen Galaxy Gear Fit has suddenly stopped syncing the step counts even though it's connected. I still receive message/call notifications on my watch and things like find my phone still works. What is going on?"
Was a great app and then over the last few months Samsung has gutted it it is now worthless glad to uninstall. thank you for your reply with regard to the app unfortunately I've become very disenfranchised with Samsung in the way it handles its consumers and the app is just another reason to continue to separate myself. And other responses from consumers are indicative of that action.
"It is a good app, but the function to track the menstrual cycle is too simple : the period's duration can't be changed although it is not five days for every woman : it would be great if the period duration could be set manually. Moreover, the duration between two cycles isn't wide enough : it would be great if the minimum could be less than 22 days, like 18 days for example."
"Dubious cut-and-paste explanation from Samsung as to why the app now needs access to your phone contacts and to make calls. I think part of it are the vague, generic permission descriptions used by Android. Nonetheless, will not be using this app again. Something doesn't feel quite right. EDIT: see what I mean below, lol!"
This needs to be able to sync with Google fit. My work has many fitness and steps challenges and is only able to sync with Google fit. I only use my galaxy watch to track my fitness goals and this makes it useless.
"I think this app is a useful tool to have an estimate of how many steps I have taken and to measure my heart rate. One problem I have with it is that the timer sometimes stops when I am using the threadmill mode, even though I am walking or running. This is so infuriating and I really hope that it can be fixed soon."
I really like it...I wish there was a good body workout app that would synchronize with it.. and if on the food log if you could make the days you dont enter anything change to a different color so if you fall of the wagon its easy to see when you start again
Good app but I use it to map what distance I walk and I am in training and the same route can vary between 4.6km and 5.8km but when looked up on google maps its actually 6.6km so it's not very accurate is the only problem and it foes pause my walk regularly even though I'm moving which is frustrating aswell.
Good App.. However! I Have Not Compared this app to any other health & fitness Apps and have only been using it for a couple months. I'm Using Without smart watch or any other accessories.. Heartbeat monitor is abit intermittent and so I'm unsure how accurate it can / should be !!!!..... Although It has now stopped working or counting my steps..(how do I fix).!!!? 01/03/20
"Had this app for years. The latest update refused access to the app unless I gave it permission to my phone?, contacts?, 2 Step verification?, Ridiculous. Very few of my apps have permission for the aforementioned items. I absolutely will not give it to Samsung Health...I deleted the app then started checking all my Samsung apps permissions and finished or began denying permissions and emptied data, oh and force stopped several. No one gets permission to force me to give permissions...."
"Until the other day, no issues, love the app, but the other day some of my settings changed for no reason and now there is nothing in the discover area, no sleep stories, meditation, exercise programs. I don't want to reset it as all my data will be lost. I have already updated it. Just don't know what I need to do??"
Everything was great and I was showing off the best feature it could offer: the weight management that shows calorie intake and calories burned and gives advice like eat a meal or do exercise if needed. Its gone and I was going to look and see what I needed to do today and I can't. EDIT 03/05/2021: BRING WEIGHT MANAGEMENT BACK DAMMIT!
"Samsung Health was the best app to track health without ads. But after the recent update they have removed the most used feature in weight management. IDK what's the reason behind it but when other app provider is thinking of providing more robust feature to their app which user can enjoy ... Samsung is thinking to remove them one by one... In short, useless app now just to use step counts which can easily be replaced by any other app."
After updating screen showing number of steps is so small! If you remove items the remaining does not expand to fit the screen so half of it is blank. Can we roll back a couple of updates please. No improvement.
"A good app, with a surprising amount of functionality, it would be great if you could combine a view of speed and position at that time within a run, it would mean that you could see where geographicly you are slower a d maybe why,"
"5 star app until 8/2020 update, now I cant view my trends for push ups, sit ups, circuit training, etc. which really throws off my goal tracking :-(. What's the point of logging your exercise if you cant view statistics on your progress? I dont get it..."
"I loved this app until the last update, a while back. I also upgraded from a Samsung Galaxy S9 plus to a Samsung 21 ultra, and I also can not check heart rate, or stress test nothing I once had, I can only count my steps. Why have this on the app but grey out. I would give 5 stars if I could go back like it was before."
"I really like this app, I just wish it could sync with all ny other apps instead of google fit. also, it would be cool if there were pregnancy specific plans/settings, and if it synced with my pregnancy tracking apps."
The app isn't consistent in measuring distance and speed. I like how it prompts workouts and attempts to motivate. The challenges are great as well.
"Lately, it's not registering movement. I'll hit start, ride ten miles.....and it shows time elapsed, but zero milage. Also getting ""low GPS"" messages for the past year, regardless of where I am. Nice when it works."
I have been using this app for years with no problems. I updated no more than 5 minutes ago and the app is constantly crashing. I can't see my info to connect apps. It just crashes.
"I use this app in conjunction with the Virgin Pulse app. My steps always matched between the two, but since the S Health update to remove the devices from where to gather the step data, defaulting to All Steps, my steps are always off, some days by 1000+. Not sure why this change was made, but beware if you are using this app to sync with another app! And reinstalling S Health does not re-add my device, as an S Health rep has already instructed, so not contacting Support again."
"App switches off by itself, don't know what is up with that - it's the only app on my phone that puts itself off, so not a phone problem and not a permission problem either since I granted all permissions for this app. Once again, not a good application since I can sit with my phone in my hand, wave it around and watch the steps increase - by using GPS these ""fake steps"" would not occur."
"The new update requires what I deem an unacceptable amount of acess to a mobile phone from an app , contacts with attached email address and phone call access. It makes you feel Samsung is untrustworthy and has some hidden motive behind wanting to access these apps. Please consider other products. Thanks for the quick response Samsung Health How come it needs access to contacts to check to see if you've signed in if through calls it verifies your unique device identifier?"
"I have a Samsung Galaxy A70 Literally can't even use the app, even after uninstalling and reinstalling. When trying to open the app, it reads "" cant set up app. this service is temporally unavailable. Try again later (0x0700010)"" Sucks because just spend 350 bucks on a galaxy watch only to have one of its major features unavailable to use on my phone"
The only thing I would like is a log to track the amount of weight you are lifting and maybe reps. The app in general is outstanding for tracking time and actions and especially the food tracking. I really enjoy using it.
"Love this app , I have since updated my Smart watch to the Galaxy active 2 . The app and watch work great together , the app let's me keep up with my workouts , running , walking etc . It actually helps push and motivate me at times when I'm not in the mood . Enjoy the monthly challenges üòÅ"
"Loved the app until the last update, now I'm being told to do a 2 stage verification thing but I'm going round in circles! I input the code and it takes me back to the 2 stage verification page ! Can't get into the app at all, totally pissed off!"
With the update it has lost a lot of functionality that was useful for the everyday person. I can't even add a manual exercise in any more if I forget to start it. This was a huge mistake!
"I used to love this app as been doing so much walking lately and used to like looking back at my route via the map but randomly the map stopped showing my route so not all all happy with that. I have the s10, my mum does too and her map still shows so unsure why mine isn't working. otherwise I would have given 5 stars"
"Love the app. However the latest version is pausing my walking workout randomly, despite the fact I am still walking between 2.5 and 3 mph. I actually got a trophy for my fastest speed of 30.1 mph because it paused for 1/4 mile."
"I would like to be able to use the workout videos and have them continue in the background. I like watching shows while working out, but the workouts pause if I get out of the app. Please fix thanks"
"When responding to my original review for the new update and other people who've had the same issue with allowing certain permissions, I've seen the same copy and paste answer from the developer that still doesn't elaborate on exactly what all the access to your phone is for and how it's used."
"The app is getting shadier and shadier with every update. I really enjoyed the monthly walking challenges, but now to participate in them you must give the app permission to happen your contacts. Sorry, Samsung, but no. Other than that the app is pretty nice nah has convenient features."
"I use this app quite frequently to track my weight and calories, but now there's an error saying that my phone is rooted. I updated the app and now its saying that unauthorized changes were made to my phone. I've never once altered or rooted my phone and always update it."
After the last update the stress measure fails half the time like I can see my heart rat and o2 sat at the bottom but the stress measure percentage just stays at zero forever and no stress measurement is being recorded. The whole app is slower now and why the hell did remove the small transparent widget the other one is just ugly
"I use the Samsung watch as a ftness tracker to keep track my steps in Samsung Health and sync with Healthy 365. But now, after the recent update, the app does not sync with Healthy 365. It is so disappointing. Can you please improve this?"
Upgraded my phone and cannot log into the app anymore. Hangs on the load screen. A quick Google suggests this issue has been around for a while. Renders my Samsung watch pointless. Very frustrating
"I bought a new phone, one plus, and it app was working fine for a couple weeks, then randomly stopped monitoring steps last Thursday. I updated the app and made sure all permissions were on, bit still won't pick up my steps."
"Updated the app and it no longer works. It will not let me uninstall YouTube videos claim this can be ""easily"" fixed by accessing the root menu and changing a 1 to a 0, and possibly ruining the phone. (replace ""ro.config.tima=1"" with ""ro.config.tima=0"")"
Why does calories to goal reset everyday. I eat 6000 calories in a day and by the night I'm over my calorie count by about 4000.then the next morning I'll be below it. Sort the app out. It really isn't accurate. It's a shame as this app has the best interface but I'll be forced to switch because of all of the faults
The app does not directly link to fitbit so any activity I do without my phone won't sync. I had an app that synced the data for me but now S Health won't give permission to that app. Very disappointing as I actively participate in the step challenges every month
"If your phone allows it, you can measure you oxygen levels within the app. Tracks sleep habits, food, weight, workouts, steps, blood glucose, blood pressure, a community aspect. Great app! Even better with a Samsung wearable paired with it."
The sleep calculates my bedtime ok but is always saying my wake up is 5 am. That's listed as my goal but it's saying that's when I wake regardless of what time I wake up. Has been doing it for 4 days now. It's 6:23 now and I just woke up and checked it and it said sleep was until 5. Please fix that bug. Otherwise it's great!
It is a great app but it lacks the motivation that Fitbit gives you in the badges they give you for steps climbed and distance walked. You need to show milestone achievement as a way of improving your app and broaden you user base.
"Love love love this app!!! Highly recommend it, especially for weightloss and healthy living. I am still tinkering with everything that is included, but so far I love it! I wish it would sync with my very fit pro watch."
"Very useful but unfortunately does not sync with Mi Body Composition Scale 2, which is also very useful for me. Had to download Mi Fit app instead. Uqntil this issue is addressed, I will be using the Mi Fit app instead of maintaining two apps."
There's no way to edit workouts. I often will forget to stop a work and realized my 30 minutes of lifting has been going for an hour. But it does almost everything else quite well. I like that there's a menstrual cycle tracker.
"This app has helped me to reach my losing weight goals when i belueved this was going to be impossible. My only problem with tjis app is that sometimes does not record my sleeping times accurately, so; I learnt to not pay to much attention to it."
"Sleep detection is absolutely useless. Wake up to go pee in the Middle of the night, it ends and you just only slept half a night. Easy fix tied to a very expensive purchase (the watch). Sad."
"This app is required to be able to use my otherwise nice, quite expensive, Galaxy Gear watch. The app now suddenly requires me to give it access to my phone so it can let people find me and market things to me. I refuse, so now my expensive fitness watch is basically useless. Previously they jammed big flashy adverts into a paid product and denied it. I'm never buying a Samsung product again"
"Too many ads. A banner telling me that I can save up to $700 on a trade-in on a new phone is in fact, an ad. The description of the app confirms that there are ads ""placed by the developer"" The latest update requires phone permissions?! Why does this app require this?"
"Running, sleep and heart rate (for all I know) works just fine. But does not seem to pick up my bike rides. Really like the layout and the whole set up, but would like to see my results after a bike ride. There's no way I only went .64 miles in distance at 24mph after 2 hours of riding."
Enjoy the app but it stopped allowing me to select exercise types and would close the app when I attempted to resume or finish an exercise. Also it appears the app can be hacked. The #1 top ranked user claims to have 2983580 steps in ty he month of April. Impossible...
"Used this app to track my weight, menstrual cycle & steps. With the new update, I can't access this data without giving Samsung permission to make calls. Not sure why a health app would need to make calls and its very annoying that you cannot use the app without allowing this feature. How can I retrieve my data without granting permission?"
i enjoyed this app for a long time. a few updates ago the app started running all the time and my phone is constantly telling me to force stop it because of its battery use. ive tried playing with the settings and cant get it to stop.
"Don't like the new update (August, 2021). I like to open the app and see how many kms I've walked and now I have to go into my steps. I get it's only one more screen but seems silly if it still has my steps in the main screen, to put the distance as well."
The latest update requires permissions for ‚úì Allow management of all files! So it can read and delete all of my files? ‚úì Access to contacts!? ‚úì Make phone calls!? All I want from the app is to simply track the steps and physical activities. The app should at least allow the choice of not allowing the permissions. I will find something else.
"Hi Team....App was working great till yesterday. Error while logging in to app is ""something went Wrong. Please try again later"". Tried reinstalling, giving all access and tried logging through settings skipping in earlier settings. It's pissing me off. Help with this."
used to work fine but it doesn't even count my steps anymore. I contact support but all they gave me was a lot of bull about making sure that the paused step was off and I told them all the information about how everything is in order. this has been like this for 6 weeks now then an update was given and started to work for only a week or 2 now its doing the same thing. it froze during the day and now it not counting steps at all. need better updates on constant bases. called doesn't help nothing
The stair climb doesn't work. This feature disabled or disappeared two updates ago. Now it is gone. Every update make the application process dumb. Why change something that was ok before. The stair climber still doesn't work. 1/27 My only option ALL steps
"Hi All,i dont understand why the app suddenly stop to count the steps. The app is good,but it has some technical issue as a result stop working. If the team can fix the issue that will really help."
"I have come to depend on this app as part of my fitness routine. It helps track many of my activities. This latest release is getting 4/5 stars because even though I have Marketing Information turned off, I just got an ad for a well-known radio subscription service."
The app is not showing activity minutes on galaxy watch. Have called several times and exchanged watch twice and removed app and reinstalled many times. Have not been able to get problem solved. Could you look into changes in app. Was working last in oct. 2019
"All issues have been fixed. I love this app. However, the ""Smart View"" function isn't working from the last update. This function is really important to me, my phone is S9 plus."
"It was great. Until I got pregnant. Two months after starting the menstrual tracker i got pregnant, which was great. But now 7 months in all the app does is mansplain how to sleep better and admonish me for decreased steps over time. I love this app... just wish i could tell it to put me in a different category."
"Nice and easy to use. Doesn't have built-in synchronization with Google Fit, which is needed to be connected to many other fitness apps, because this app is not very much supported directly. I found only app for which you need to pay."
"I loved the app until this last update. The weight management has been removed. It was to me the most important feature of this app. I hope you bring this feature back. In the meantime, I'm looking for a new health app with that feature. I will change my review to 5 star when this has been returned."
"Used the app for years and features just keep disappearing. First integration with apps like runkeeper, and now I can't even find a way to make a simple pace run in the app with a warm up and cool down. What is going on?"
The new update is miles better without hardly changing anything. Enjoy that now in the together section you can add more than one person to the challenge. Would be nice if it wasn't just step challenges but cycling etc. Nativagion could still be made easier.
"I own a Samsung galaxy phone and 2 samsung watches. I use the active 2 to track my cycling. When i do, the voice out says i have completed 1 mile every single time even after i have done 6 miles. Why? On the other hand, the older watch will say i have completed 6 miles. Why the inconsistencies? Does the software need an update to reflect accumulated mileage?"
Dislike the new update that does not allow passing over data(from mobile) to 3rd party app. Guess its a business decision as your sales of wearables will go up. But i do not have a wearable and I hope you reinstate this feature in your next update.
"Why the sudden need for the app to have access to manage calls is beyond me, I dont believe that its necessary and just to be ""to optimise user interface"" the user interface was just fine before this sudden need where I cant even access the app through fear that I am gonna be charged for all the long distance calls its gonna make and how the app is gonna listen to what I talk about during calls and target even more rubbish ads at me."
"The app is really good, no doubt. It needs a permission update though. I can't allow location access all the time and hence, can't track distance from my activities using my Galaxy Watch Active paired with Pixel 3 ( Android 11 ). Please fix!"
"Pretty good app. Keeps me honest. Could always use more food/ nutrition counts, exercises and would like to see it get a bit smarter. Lots of repetitive messages."
"Hi My Samsung Health app keeps on saying ""Unable to upload Samsung Health data to server. Please try manual sync in the Discovery app"". it gives me this message when i want update my profile on the Vitality app. What should I do, because I tried the manual sync and it still does not work. Regards"
"I had my my s7 version of this app and everything there is complete..i can measure my stress level, heart rate and oxygen sat..i was surprised that the version of the app in my note 10 doesnt contain all these features. Just disappointing"
"Great when I first had the phone, but since updating the app, I can't track where I've walked/cycled or run on maps. And yes my location is switched on. Same as most apps. Great until you update them :("
"Really? I buy your $900 over inflated priced phone and that's not enough. Now you plan on filling over a quarter of my screen with BS ads for more of your own product? For shame Samsung... For shame! This app used to keep me on track, now I'm forced to use it for step counting and fitness logging through another app. Good luck! ***Update *** Thanks for the automated response... Good to know that Samsung gives a s#it. I'm not having trouble with the functionality. The problem is your greed."
Useless. Sleep is recorded poorly and the app doesn't allow you to expand the sleep record to see detail. For the last week it has just stopped showing the sleep stages completely. Useless!
It would really be a good idea to allow scanning of a food item. Logging my food seems to complicated and I'm unable to add most things because I'm unable to scan for the item.
I love it. VERY VERY helpful in losing weight. please leave instructions how to reset activity alert. I. e. not moving in thirty minutes. let's go for a walk. can't find it. thank you in advance. Samsung 6 s
"This was a great food tracking app until the recent update. Now you only see percentages of macronutrients, no longer gram totals. Ruined. Yea.. that's the version I have. You need to show gram totals of macros like you used to, not just % of total intake."
"The more its updated, the worse it gets. The step counting keeps stopping mid day. And you set an activity and it pauses even when you are mid run etc. Have to keep reinstalling it to get it to work again."
Can't even get past the setup. Gets stuck at the 2-factor ID.
"Hi, Samsung has removed BP & Heart Beat Sensors from Note 10 plus. Its really wrong after paying this much samsung is not giving options similar to old flagship phones. What is the purpose of having new phone when features are less & cost is high. Its a kind of blackmail that support is suspended for old model so you have to buy new model, more costly & less features... Regards,"
I really enjoyed using this app. From the first thing in the morning to the last thing at night I enter data. This app has really helped me to keep track of my steps my food and my water intake. I have just recently started using the blood glucose tab. The only downside is I am on low carb Keto and this nutrition is the old food triangle.
"Looks like my previous review was removed. So once again, I suggest those who want the SpO2 sensor to be usable, to uninstall any updates and use the stock version as it's been taken out, and combined with the stress reading which is practically useless. Also disabling uotmatic updates doesn't seem to work, as the update got applied again. Please fix this."
"I was disappointed that the app wanted to have permission for my address book, phone, camera, etc. I understand it is for the togetherness function. Well, I do not want to use the togetherness function, so I do not understand why I have to allow these permissions. You say that it will not be used for other thing, but I have heard that before."
I like how it monitors the nutrients you eat and need BUT it is not 100% accurate in terms of how much nutrients there are in food. For example 2 cups of spinach doesn't have 0.4mg of iron. This lack of accuracy makes it difficult to meet nutrient goals
Very good but the voice announcement on there always sounds so tired and unmotivated. Would really like to hear a more positive voice telling you how many miles you completed! Also is nice to join the challenges.
"Disappointing at times... Cant log in number of calories burned or consumed without indicating specific food or workout type, time, distance and the additional factors that I dont want to log in sometimes... Also cant set the specific target amount of calories I want to burn and consume in a day... Hopefully it will get fixed."
"Good job listing a ""no reply"" email address for customer enquiries... Would be a great app if I could access the weight management element. If you only want to supply half an app - at least give us the option to use different fitness apps now that I've invested in your watch."
"After recent updates, getting Error 0x2a#0 when trying to open program. Tried deleting cache and data, uninstall, restart, etc. Can't find a definitive reason online. Using OnePlus 8 5G. Can't use some of the new features on Galaxy Watch 4 because of this!"
"I think this app has blocked use of my camera and flashlight. I have spent countless hours troubleshooting the problem. When I disabled this app, then my flashlight and camera work again. This error occurred with the last update. Please check in to this."
"Regularly stops recording activity mid run - 30 min run, only records 12 mins of steps and exercise. I've sent regular error reports & all engineers say is bring the phone in. The phone was a gift from Dubai but I live in Australia & Samsung here won't take it. I've cleared Cache, reinstalled, and upgrqdrd Android OS with no improvement. Sick of my 30min Parkruns only being recorded for 12 minutes."
"I have loved using this app, however I can't get past the new privacy notice since new update. It wants me to allow access to telephone and won't open if I choose deny access to make calls. I don't want it to make calls. Very DISAPPOINTED!!!"
"This is a great app, but one thing that I think they should add is the ability to edit your macro percentages. Currently they only have preset recommended daily macro intakes. Being able to edit those on your own would make this app much better!!"
Since yesterday's system update on my S9 the pedometer stops counting steps all the time... uninstalled and installed again and step count worked all morning and now stopped again. I have tried everything.... so frustrated!!! Can't reinstall twice a day every day... please help!!!!
"It is not opening and it shows that my phone has been rooted, even my mobile is a new one and i had bought it just one week back. It shows that it does not work on rooted phones, while other samsung apps are working properly."
It has changed the way I use to experience my workout regimes. My life has changed. The motivational punch in the app during workout boost confidence. The summary of wkout can also b controlled through earplug control.
"Edit: I had to factory reset my phone and so had to reinstall the app but then after the reinstall, dark theme isn't available anymore. Is there any specific reason why? Edit: Android 8 doesn't have a dark mode but then how did I get the dark theme in the app before? There was a switch in the app to activate dark theme. Why was it removed?"
"Used this app daily for a few years but now I can't get in to it, seems I have to accept them having phone settings access. So basically my data is now not available so all the data I inserted over time which I would show to my doctor on occasion is now gone .... this sort of negative experience results in my business going elsewhere from now on."
I hadn't really paid much attention before but I have been trying to be more active & have started checking my steps mostly curiosity & I noticed yesterday it wasn't counting any of my steps & I had been up for hours. I tried pausing my steps & then un pausing & that seemed to work yesterday it isn't working today. I was also looking through my history & there are several days where it doesn't even record a single step I know I didn't just leave my cell in 1 place 4 days. Can you fix this!!
"getting worse after recent updates, used Samsung sport watches for 2 years, the gear sport usually hang recently when running, and wasted all my workout ... for watches... seems another brand.... maybe better...thinking to say byebye to my gear sport. ... the system for the watch is too complicated for the spec. of gear sport, makes it always hang... and poor user satisfaction"
"Suddenly this app is DRAINING my watch. It was never a problem until recently and the watch is only three months old. My watch won't even make it a full 8 hour work day anymore, and the only thing using up battery is this app. What's up? Did something change in an update that's using more battery?"
"It works well for me. The step counter seems accurate, the pulse reader is good. I wish there was a widget for the water and caffeine so I could just press a button to +1 without opening the whole app."
"Since the last update i couldnt use the app any more for running and making exercices; i was using the guide withe modes to run in a good way with the guide and no i am running alone it is so sad for me, the update is made to develop something and make it better not to delete amazing features without replacing them."
"Great app, but after the last update, an unremoveable notification keeps appearing about the step target of the day. This is of course really annoying. And if I disable the 'step' category to get rid of those notifications, I don't get any info about my steps that day. Either split up these categories, let me disable this particular notification or just let me remove the notification. Edit: gotta love those automated replies saying I need to call them about what I've already told them here."
"I'm unable to get past the starting screen of the app after uninstalling and reinstalling, this has all happened after the recent update when nothing on the app was working properly. please fix this, thank you."
"This is terrible, I can't even access the app. I just get a spinning wheel once logging in that never progresses. I do not expect this from Samsung. And Samsung put an actual response on here not just ""please call our helpline"" and fix the app."
"Loved the app until an update and now to use the app I have to agree to all permissions first. I don't understand why this app needs permission to access my contacts and document files, but without accepting I can't use the app. Unacceptable!!"
"6-24-20: App has access to an extensive 'food library'. However, the lack of a free text ""notes"" field in each category (especially: ""sleep"", ""food"" & ""BP"", ...) and for each day limits this app's usefulness to be able to document reasons for readings & results for review."
"I used this app before the new update and it was working fine. But after the update, I doesn't sync workout and sleep tracking doesn't sync deep sleep , light sleep and etc. Can you fix these issue cuz I would still luv to use this app !!!!!"
The main reason I switched to a Samsung watch was to do the monthly challenges. Today I started the one for January (global challenge) and there are already people with 250+k steps. Its disappointing to see cheaters take the top positions when they didn't earn them. Very discouraging. üòî Something needs to be done about this!
"Generally ok, I find this app glitchy at times. The weekly summary for example doesn't always come through and it needs to be reinstalled one too many times for it to work properly."
"Strava interaction is a shame, when (after about 6 hours) the app updates with Strava info it crashes when I try to open my activities. And now after the last update the app does not even open anymore. Cheaper smartwatch apps works a lot better than this samsung app."
"Like many others have pointed out, since the last update was released and the Weight Management feature being removed was a bad move Samsung! This was a key feature of why I would you the app daily. Please bring the feature back!"
"Audio Feedback issues! Give me an option to turn off all audio feedback, it interferes with my music playback (PowerAmp), which is 1000x more important.. or, I'll just unistall S Health. Simples!"
I'm giving this one star because it seems to interfere with my phone's battery savings features. My phone doesn't go to sleep and it's sucking up my phone's battery even if I'm not using it the entire day. This was my problem 3 years ago and I'm surprised this issue hasn't been fixed still.
"I have a Samsung fit and it doesn't always sync properly with my Samsung phone. Some days me manually forcing it to sync works, some days I lose thousands of steps. And...for sure if I didn't manually force it to sync 20 times a day I would lose most of my step info."
"They seem to keep removing features, like O2 saturation, and the app could use a redesign to streamline. It works fairly well for tracking my runs though. Edit: I'm in Canada."
"After latest update on watch software, Workout widget just disappeared!! You guys... After a few minutes of my workout, suddenly stops tracking my pulse, it just got lost and won't detect anything. Very unreliable..."
"This is great for physical health, tracking your women's health (if your a lady you know what I mean.) Track your water intake, calories you intake in a day. Walking distances, exercises, how many steps. And get badges for completing your goals. Set what workouts you do, exercise with a coach too! All Samsung phones come with this, so definitely recommend using it. No purchase required too!"
"Bought the S10 over the S10e for the oxygen saturation feature & telephoto lense. Now Samsung has removed the oxygen saturation? Samsung when I buy a new phone it should do what my old phone can do plus more - not less. Removing features after I've been using them for months with the s10 is no way to retain customers. Why would your exclude Canada & Cypress from this feature you originally provided? With the s20 not having a headphone jack I won't be buying another Samsung phone, goodbye Samsung"
"I don't know what kind of update you pushed today, but it almost destroyed my phone. 35 notifications, massive overheating, and prevention of power-off. I had to put it in the freezer, it was so hot. Immediate uninstall."
"Latest update completely broke the app. I wasn't happy about giving up permissions, but I caved and now get into an infinite loop setting up 2 factor auth. Hasn't worked in over a month and I used to love this program."
"It appears the app combines the information from my Galaxy watch and the information from the app, so when I take a walk, the app says I took 2 walks at the same time, subtracting calories that weren't burned. I'm not sure how to prevent this."
Update was installed automatically but was interfering with other contacts etc. I uninstalled update and have lost all my samsung health data. Months of exercise data which kept me motivated after stopping smoking. I'm gutted.
"I really dislike the forced two factor ID. It makes simple on/off a big hassle. I do not need to add hassle into a daily work out. Too bad, I actually purchased my Samsung phone to assure this app was readily available. Why isnt this MY choice? REPLY: You appear not to understand. I do not need operational instructions or a sales pitch on why you choose to make this complex. I was trying to provide you feedback on why I deleted the app. Wish you were listening to your users instead of justifying"
"Very cool and excellent virtual exercise assistant and many other great health and wellness tools for measurement, encouragement, and balance...for a complete health and wellness profile!! Been using since App was developed and very pleased with its evolution!!!"
It used to work great. Now it shuts down every time I try and do stress test. I selected multiple and shuts down. I even tried uninstalling and reinstalling but it is still broken. Very unhappy!
it was fun while it lasted. there's no need for me to give it permission to make phone calls because i don't use any features whatsoever that would require that. i use(d) it to track my food & water intake and weight trends. period. i guess i'll be finding another app for that.
"I also used the Weight management setting every day and now find the App useless without it. When I go to the gym I use the Exercise setting to track my time on the equipment I use, this also has been changed for the worse. Really disappointed!!"
I deleted my account once permissions are required for my phone and contacts. I will not be back unless this requirement is removed. I don't do the Together challenges and don't want to give up my privacy for an app. Very disappointing for a loyal Samsung user.
This tracks a max of three different types of exercise. Means that it only ever collects half your data. So all the higher level analysis is pointless. An arbitrary limitation. Weird.
"After the most recent update my Samsung smartwatch no longer syncs to Samsung Health automatically, I have to open the app to sync the data. My company fitness plan rewards me for exercising, so this problem is impacting me financially. Please fix this!"
"Quite a nice app! It does, however, constantly use a bit too much cpu time (2%), usually more than the system itself! Denying the ""phone"" permission halves this usage, but it still is way too much, in my opinion."
"The app installs but says cant install, as its a rooted phone. I never rooted the phone. I once had my screen broken and i got it repaired from ubreakifix and apart from that I've been updating my phone multiple times whenever an update comes. Nothing irregular. I use a Canadian Model Galaxy Note 8."
"I have used this app for years. I started off weighing 475, I am now 220. Still working towards my goal. Traking my fitness reaching my levels are important tracking what I eat. It has helped my through a really difficult journey, but well worth it."
Seems very straightforward and simple to use. The one major thing I'm missing is being able to edit My food items. You can't even delete an item if you made a typo. Or am I just not seeing any edit options?
"One step forward and 2 steps back. Just when they fix the Samsung Pay on the Gear s3, and the Health App eating b the gear S3 battery like crazy, things are great for a couple months. Now I get constant warnings about the Health App using too much of my phone battery after the last update. Uninstalling for now till the next version is out."
"Very good way to keep track of all aspects of fitness and health. Other than ability to scan food products, search is pretty good. Nice interface and great challenges"
"Love this app, need to add more excercises to track or have an option where you can type the exercise done if not on the list. Another thing, bring back taking blood pressure with phone sensor."
"I hate the new weight tracker. Why would you remove the option to have different ways to look at the graph. I used to be able to change the view to weekly, monthly, etc but now I have to scroll all the way back to my previous record, I can't view the trend. You ruined it."
I use this app daily. The only reason for a less than 5 star review is the deletion of deficit calories from the most recent update. If I have a 500 calorie deficit daily I will loose a pound a week. I have lost 36 pounds so far using this app! But with the deficit calorie count NOT being built in now I have to daily go in (for the previous day) and locate the total daily calories burned and subtract the total food intake to get that deficit. Please put this back into the app - please!
"After the latest update of samsung health, it doesn't get connected to healthifyme app. So it has stopped syncing the steps. I think the bug has to be fixed as soon as possible."
"App works well, useful and motivational...monthly challenges could be better. Rather than running in the background app sometimes opens...calories burnt differs from other apps, don't know which is correct."
"I had a Samsung before the phone I have now (which is not a Samsung but it is Android). The app was perfect for me and my needs! I had no problems with it but now that I switched phones and started using the app again on this phone, it's not counting my steps anymore. I've walked a good 2000 steps so far today but the app is saying I've walked under 200. Is it supposed to work on other phones? Because I feel like it works when I have the app open but not otherwise."
I lowered my rating because the breathing excercises on the stress level page has a bug. Doesn't work at all. That is disappointing because that is the only part of the app i used besides the step counter.
"Loved most of function but some functions are limited.( i have galaxy z fold 2 and watch 3.) I can't measure ""stress"" and this is not provided with Samsung Canada but this function is available with Samsung Korea or other countries... Also, i can't set the challenge duration if i am challenging 1:1 with my friend."
The best app out there IMO. The only issue I have is the need to enter the duration for push ups and pull ups. And it would be great if you could add ring pull ups and ring dips.
Overall functional but needs improvement. The food and diet tracking feature is lacking very basic. It's hard to look up foods and unable to use scanner to look up food easier Also exercise calories dont subtract from food calorie intake for a daily calorie total . Please improve this feature
The step counter widget does not match the new UI design with rounded corners. It is a useful feature but it would be nice if you could adapt it to the latest design language.
"The new version removed critical information for my health tracking! The app now does not support the watch features. This app is a bloated downgrade and fails to provide advertised support. Samsung is responsible for coordinating information from the watch to the phone app. By disabling features from the watch to the app, they have devalued the watch. All that is left of serious concern is the step counter. Samsung has failed in the latest update and doesn't appear to value customer concerns. Responses to inquiries appear to be machine generated and show no concern for the problem. Better to spend money for another brand!"
"Good but doesn't track everything. Just updated and my watch shows over 8,000 steps but the app shows 6,000. That's 2,000 I'm losing. Kinda sucks when trying to do challenges. But over all good app and watch. Also had issues signing back in after the update."
The App has stopped syncing steps to MyFitnessPal. Which worked seamlessly before the last update. I've tried all methods of restoring this but the only option I'm left with is the update has somehow stopped this from working? Can this be rectified?
"One of the best applications, however, what I miss here is the option of automatic recognition of gym exercises and the number of repetitions. Now you have to choose the exercise manually."
"I use this app daily, this is the best all around app I have ever used to track everything health and it is fairly accurate. The only change I would like to see is more in depth calorie/nutrition options and data for when tracking my dietary needs."
App never works... Honestly download something else bc it has a lot of problems. Now it's required to set up two step verification and it doesn't even accept the code that it sends to the phone number. Don't waste your time
I never used this app as I use one specifically for my smartwatch. But my phone updated a couple of days ago and started opening this app by itself even though I repeatedly forced it to close and tried to stop the settings opening it. Have uninstalled it because it's so obtrusive.
"This app use to be helpful, now all of the stress and heart parts are gone. I used this as a helpful tool. Now this app is absolutely useless. What a bummer Samsung health. Your app is worthless to many. I will no longer be purchasing the smart watch to go with it. Disappointed doesn't cover it!"
"I have been using for past three four years, and now the past two work outs, it shows no record of my riding. I cycle üö≤ 20 plus miles and I dont get no miles recored ur app has not been up to par and this makes me upset hence the one star rating. After your new update it just made it unusable time for change I guess samsung u had a good app, u really did smh."
"Still can't edit my tracked sleep from the Watch 4. It's been months with several updates but no change with this issue. My watch died last night, tracked some sleep, but I can't enter the rest of my sleep. I have reached out to the support team, no response. Please contact them for me and fix this issue."
"I have to retract my 4 star rating. For the last week SHealth has been adding approx 3000 steps instantly to my step count near the end of each day. Also it has also been incorrectly sending my weekly step streak to my Galaxy Active watch for the last 6 weeks. I have uninstalled it, forced stop and cleared cache. Does not help. I am in Australia, so don't tell me to call the US based team. Samsung, please fix these bugs between your equipment, you are pushing me to Apple"
"Still can't measure blood pressure with my watch. Got the galaxy 3 which was advertised to do a lot more... Months down the road, and I still have an expensive watch that can't do some of the advertised features."
"I like this app a lot but I don't like the lay out of the updated version. After the update, all the foods I calorie counted are mixed in with foods I never myself added (which means I'm spending too much time digging around in this section of the app.) Is it possible to go back to the previous layout?"
I have used it for the last six months to keep track of my calories and exercises. Lost 26kg(4.5st) so far. A great app and a few minor tweaks would make it fantastic.
Loved the app until they decided to no longer allow sync with other apps and devices. I've disabled this app on.my Samsung S10+ since its no longer as flexible an app that I needed. Poor choice very poor choice limiting users options.
"MOST of the new update is good. I do not like not being able to see my old sleep rates and some of the past stuff. I like being able to look back day by day and see my sleep rate from the day before as well, or days before. Now I can't see my percentage rate day by day unless I hold my finger on it and then it only tells me the hours it doesn't show me when I was awake or in deep sleep. Not happy no stars if I could."
excellent app for fitness. good and easy to use fun and challenging. this is a great tool to helping you keep track of everything in one simple place. integrates with all devices. love it. ‚ô•Ô∏è
"Hello, I have a question about adding food. Why it is only possible to choose some abstract ""serving"" metric? It would be great to specify grams instead. Or maybe I just did not found how to use metric system when adding custom food type? Also, it would be cool to have the possibility to scan the packaging and fill up nutritional value similar to alternative apps. Finally, I can see multiple comments about removing the calories counting functionality. Could you please tell more about this?"
Does not connect with 3rd party apps. Can't get credit through my work for programs completed. Especially after purchasing phone s21+ and watch4. Very disappointed. Called customer service they informed me samsung discontinued working with 3rd party apps on latest update.
"Battery killer. This app easily uses 15% (or more) battery on any given day, as compared to 2 or 3% max for any other app. Even after I stopped ""body sensor"" permissions and ""contacts"" permissions, it continues to drain my phone battery. If I could find a way to bypass this app and have my Gear upload directly to MyFitnessPal, I'd delete this app in a second. There's no reason it should be draining 5 times more battery life than any other app."
Adverts adverts adverts... I don't expect to pay ¬£1000 for a phone which has adverts in every single stock app. In this app they take up a third of the screen and there is no way of getting rid! Wish I didn't buy a ¬£400 galaxy watch as now I'm forced to used this rubbish. **EDIT** Blatent lies from Samsung below... The ads are glaringly obvious to anyone who uses the app.
"I recently traded in my S8 for the S21 and found that this app has changed, not for the better. I have asthma and used the heart rate monitor and the blood oxygen monitor to help manage my care. You took those features out and now I can't monitor my health and keep a record of it. Please add those features back into the program!"
Unhappy with latest update. Weekly/monthly trends are gone. Snack meals are now all lumped in together. Gram totals for macros are gone which is primarily what I was using for. Unable to turn off BMI information which will always be a dumb measure for athletes. I was really enjoying this app until the update üòû
"I should not be forced to use 2 step authentication. This is unacceptable. Update after response: Hi Samsung, I don't care about your 2 step authentication. I'm not going to use the app while you have it as a forced step. I don't need your explanation how to make it happen, because I don't want it. This app is deleted. Until you can actually address my concern properly please don't give me any replies."
"Awful update, I have used this app to help me lose 20Kg over the past 12 months but the latest update has gotten rid of the ability to see weight data averaged over months or weeks, the data is still there so why would you get rid of the aggregation?! Lots of other features slowly being removed, think it is time to switch back to apple products tbh."
This used to be a really good app. Worked all the time. But of late it's just not logging anything. Not even step count. Constant white screen. Have to force stop then restart. I'm going to look for another app that works.
"With each new update Samsung Health App is getting worse. You've dropped some useful features, tinkered unnecessarily with certain other and reintroduced a feature which no one likes - my Samsung Gear S3 battery is again draining pretty fast - about 25% more than prior to your latest update. Have you decided to bid Good bye to Smart watch segment?"
"On first time install, while the app is in English, the Page to login to Samsung account is in a different language, with no option to select English. Somehow after managing to enter my credentials at the right place by guesswork, the second page opens which is also not in English and I can't understand what's it asking me to fill and thus I can't login to the app."
My galaxy watch and Samsung health both start steps over around 8pm. Just started recently. I need this fixed.
"Pretty accurate if phone is in a trouser pocket or clipped to your belt, but is not if you hold the phone. It doesn't work if the phone is in a coat or jacket pocket. I did a walk which I knew to be roughly 6000 steps, and it recorded less than 700!"
"Hi can you please make this app as good as my fitness pal or others? My fitness pal has a barcode scanning feature. Please do this too as almost all, HEAPS of the food brands I eat are NOT listed so I have to go in and type it all up. This makes me want to switch over to the other app Also please provide an option to include the body fat percentage and an option to change my daily macro goals as the ones listed arent accurate for me. add: thx I will stop using samsung health until you fix it"
"Decent app IMO, suggestion though, I'm night shift and since I wake up at 8pm, most days, and take walks between two separate days, the app splits the amount of steps I take between two days, even though it's just my schedule. It's confusing, but their should be an option to set my ""awake hours"" so that I can see what I actually walked while I was was awake, not how many steps I took on a specific date"
Honestly. Samsung Heath is just okay. I use this because I'm used to it. What would make this app 5 stars would be the addition of a barcode scanner. I would even pay to use the feature. Not having a barcode scanner really makes the application a sub par experience.
I'm really upset that the step counter is either phone or both watch & phone. I should have option for just watch to count my steps. On the Samsung forum most people think that something is wrong with app & forum admin doesn't even that this was just an update. Neither does tech support. They had send my galaxy watch because they didn't have a clue. I deleted my S health data because Samsung recommended it that it would restore s health back to the way it was. I uninstalled s health.
"Used to be even better, but recently the daily reminders that I would get each morning to track my sleep have stopped all of a sudden and I'm not sure why. I checked my settings and still no luck. Otherwise, I would rate higher."
"For several months I have been unable to use the app, keep getting info that permission needs to be granted in settings...all my attempts to access have FAILED. It's a shame, I really enjoyed the app when I COULD use it, now its just a waste of space and time. Fyi, I have cleared cache REPEATEDLY to No avail"
"Recent update destroyed food data. Used to suggest foods recently added by meal. Now all come up for every meal, and are all jumbled up. You people screwed it up again. I am going to get a different app, and when this Samsung phone dies, I will NEVER get another one, and will not reccomend Samsung again, as I have since we got Galaxy 4s. I have a 9+ now. Forgets meals entered .... SUCKS! Back up an upgrade and try again!!"
"I enjoy this app. It's kind of basic though & isn't very accurate with the step count - but it's a phone & not a fitbit. Oh & it's free, which is definitely a plus since most health apps charge either for the app or a subscription."
"Locked me out of App. I used this app many times over the years Ober multiple devices sporadically when I didn't want to manually check HR to compare to a device. Spot check HR, etc. I have barely used it on my s10√∑ and last time I tried it couldn't pick up my HR, now a month later I cannot even get into the app- it says permissions are the issue- but even when allowed I cannot get into the app. Maybe it's time to delete the app?"
"Used to be an awesome app. Have used it for years. However, with all the updates and not being able to see your Oxygen level, etc., the app is now useless to me. The app should not require access to my contacts, phone, or any of my other apps. I do not need the same generic response you are giving everyone else. I am uninstalling your app. I will be looking a new app for walking, calorie counting, and others. Sorry but you have ruined this app for me and many others."
The latest update does not work. I have tried your suggestions from the previous review and it didn't work. My watch doesn't sync with the app. Very disappointed- I've spent ages trying to sort it out. Very poor.
The latest upgrade breaks the app. Asks for a lot of permissions and even if you grant them it just stays stick at the 2 fa screen. Even after you set up 2 factor auth it stays stuck. Essentially making this app completely useless
"I've used this app, but not regularly. yesterday, I got a pop-up saying health can't be used on a rooted phone. MY PHONE IS NOT ROOTED. Some suggestions were to Force Stop, and clear cache. nada. it keeps popping up on it's own. I uninstalled the app. fix this!"
I love the app but I can't enter as we have to use a 2 step verification process. Which would be fine if my number was correct or I was give a verification number when I first started. I've tried changing the number and it didn't work. My health is not worth a 2-step process. I have the f-ing password.
"I can't sign into the app. üò† I have huawei p20 pro and the animation after entering username and pass keep circles. Is it possible that the watch that costed more than 200$ doesn't have an stable functioning app to support?! Wasted money. üí∏ And no, i don't want any phone number to call customer support because i don't want to waste any more money on you, just solve the issue!!"
"I can't use the step counter because it's draining my battery. First it didn't count steps reliably, now it drains the battery. I had to put it to sleep. It's still useful for monitoring water intake and watching what I eat but that's all."
Great App for monitoring health especially with Galaxy watch 4
"I used to really like this app, but I uninstalled it when the newest update required permission to access my phone and make calls without my knowledge. There isn't any legitimate reason for any app to need those privileges. RESPONSE TO SAMSUNG'S COMMENT: You've provided a non-answer. An ""in app feature"" could cause my phone to call a bogus number in the Cayman Islands at my expense, or harass my friends to promote your product. HARD NO! Listen to your customers, and remove that feature!"
"Thanks for this beautiful design, but I have issues after the latest update. After update in my profile page when it updated told me "" not response from service, please try again later "" And another problem when I wanted to connect with together again configuring data appeared and take a lot of time and finally the message appeared to me "" error 5101 "" Please I want a solution for these issues."
"I loved using this app, until this new update. I used the buttons on my dashboard for walking, cycling and other activities. Put them back on the main page please! All I had to do was scroll to the bottom of the page and hit start, now I have to search top find what I'm looking for. It has become less user friendly. üôÅ"
"I use this App every day ,it is very helpful it really deserves 5 stars, Is so gratifying to be in the 2 percent worldwide, the reason why only one star is because there is thousands of cheaters in the challenges, and there is no answer from Samsung when this is going to be stop. How is possible that in one day someone finishes the challenge?"
"I like the woman's health part of the app to help keep track of my cycle. However, I have to make my own foods such as meatloaf because store bought has things I can't digest. Then, there are brands that aren't available, such as the Aldi brands. We also hunt and fish and venison is rarely available as a choice. Stripped bass isn't an option either. I have a lot of things I can't eat due to intolerance so I make my own and there's no option for homemade, it's all processed and store bought."
"Disappointing they updated and now it's mandatory to give them permissions to my phone calls to use the step counter. What BS! Deleting this useless app! EDIT: Dear developer,You shouldn't need phone call info/number to manage the step counter. It would be better to request permissions based on the features used. No one believes that you don't sell or share our info. Also thanks for suggesting emailing a ""no reply"" email address"
They made it almost impossible to connect to your other fitness apps. Use to be able to connect to myfitnesspal. Now I have to get a whole different app to help sync and u have to pay for it.
"I used this app regularly for over a year and think it is very comprehensive. Unfortunately, the app now asks for very invasive permissions. I don't need the 'together' feature. The day you fix the required permissions to a reasonable set, I will re-install the app. I'm sure there are other Android APIs to get the unique ID without asking for such invasive permissions. At some point, your product manager should review these comments from various people and re-think whether your decision is enabling or hurting adoption."
"Good application but there is so much things to improve especialy in Running activity option.With connected samsung watch it should have more options like planing route on the phone and transfering on the watch,VO2max calculation,HR zones,etc etc....good ,but for company as Samsung is ..must be much better."
"Can you guys please tweak the sleep app so that we can see last 7 days/30 days of ""deep"" sleep? App shows phase details on daily sleep. But only shows total sleep for the week or month. Because I have a sleep disorder, It would really help to see how much deep sleep I'm getting over time. To tell if actions, activities, food are affecting it. Deep sleep is the crucial phase for healing & restoration. There is currently no way to view the data this way. Would really be helpful. Thanks"
"Loved it but now you want phone permissions. Don't need any account security, you're using it as a blatant excuse. Why do I need two step authentication for a simple step counter and weight monitor, which is all I use it for. Uninstalled. Hopefully others follow. Edit: my experience was already ""optimal"". You're using this allegedly for the security texts but even my BANKING app doesn't do this. Look at all the 1 star reviews you're now getting. Have a think"
3yrs and still a Samsung Health user. Excellent app. Especially if you have a Galaxy watch. The only thing I think this app really needs is messaging to people you have as friends. I've met throughout my couple yrs a good 10 people that I have on monthly challenges that we can only talk to one another through CHALLENGING ONE ANOTHER!!. LOL.. someone out there that will read this will know exactly what I mean. Lol. .MAKE MESSAGING A KEY FEATURE AND WATCH THIS APP EXPLODE!! ROOTING for this!!
"I have downloaded the app but cannot get it to open. It worked for the first 6 months. After it stopped giving me quality of sleep, only hours slept I uninstalled, then reinstalled. Now I cannot open. I get stuck at agreeing to privacy? It tells me to go to settings which I do....and then? So my fit band is now only a watch? Please help."
"I like many features of the app. It helps me manage my calorie intake to assist in weight loss. A couple of recommendations. 1, add more food into your database. When I used myfitnesspal I was able to find many foods not in Samsung Health. 2, please add calories burned to your weekly summary. I primarily use the app to track calories burned and calorie intake. A calorie comparison between intake and burned would be very beneficial to me."
"""OTHER WORKOUTS"" feature doesn't seem to work. Won't upload my gymrun data even though it is active in the connected apps. The calorie tracker on Samsung health is very inaccurate and I would much rather import my data from my gymrun app. Can this be accomplished? If so, how? I searched the internet for hours and havnt found an answer as to how to do this."
I am using this app for long and more or less satisfied. But for last two days App is giving wrong information about my location in spite location is on. It takes me airly to 1 Km away from my location. How this happens I do not know but it shows me far away and come back at the fracion of second. please correct the bug.
"Ads. S Health gets 2 stars because of ads. Even if you turn off third party marketing, you still get Samsung product ads at the VERY TOP of the app. And this is for people who've spent $$$ on a premium Samsung device. Now, beyond that, S Health is pretty good. It tracks all kinds of stuff like activities, food, menstraul cycles, sleep, etc. Is it Fitbit app good? Nope. But it's pretty solid. Those ads tho"
I am having issues logging in. I set up the two step authentication but it keeps asking me to do it again and then telling me to contact the administrator. I just want to be able to use the app. It should not be this challenging.
Unwanted garbage. Fitbit is much better. I have used Fitbit for 5 years no issue with establishinh connection w phone. only I switched to big brand to find out their pro 5 watch always get disconnected and Every now n then ask me reset and delete my data to re establish connection with my phone. Regret buying this worthless watch and not sticking with fitbit. I really don't know what is the purpose of this watch when it can't handshake on his own with my phone. wasted so much of money n brain.
You new privacy policy will not let me sign in. YOU DON'T NEED ACCESS TO MY CONTACTS!!! All I want is to track MY progress. I'm not interested in your challenges. I I want the option of choosing which apps you have access to! Fix the problem. Your auto generated response is UNACCEPTABLE! I AGREE WITH EVERYONE IT'S TIME TO SAY GOODBYE TO SAMSUNG
"This app sucks & the customer support isn't any better. So many issues I don't know where to begin! My profile was showing me as male although I had entered female when I created it. It's not syncing right with my account @ My Fitness Pal. It's not allowing me to adjust my Weight Management settings & it's always showing me as OVER when I know for a fact that I'm UNDER my caloric intake based on my meals & level of activity. Now, suddenly it stopped logging in my stair-climbing!!! WTH???!!!"
"The app has been great for me, works extreamly well with my Galaxy watch. It counts my steps accurately and is very good at keeping track. My only reason for not giving 5 stars is the fact that they have removed the community section; this was a great way to keep me motivated but had recently been removed for some reason."
"I am having an issue with being able to open the app. Are one time I was able to use this app all the time. Now it doesn't work, I am getting an error to contact support. I have tried to uninstall app and reinstall and no luck."
"I installed this app on my huawei device. However, the app unable to count my steps correctly. It will only work when the screen is on. If i just leave my phone in my pocket and wall, mostly like nothing will be counter. I have no choice to install this because the fitness app that developed by a the AIA vitally only support Samsung Health but not the steps count from my huawei device. Unfortunately, this app doesn't help at all."
"Tracks most things well. Syncs well with Galaxy watch, and get good analysis of runs. Has various social elements to compete/challenge, but not many people I know use it, which detracts from these features a bit."
"This app was designed by an alien and tested by professional reviewers. I have never found it to be user friendly and it begs the question, ""why create all this health stuff if you're just going to make it so difficult to use?"" Just have a button to check blood pressure guys... It's real easy to just make a button that says ""blood pressure, ""then let me press it to turn on that feature and test my blood pressure. It's amazing this is a finished product for mass consumption... Samsung, come on."
"I started using this app after I had a pulmonary embolism so I could keep track of my O2 saturation from home..It is fast and accurate... My only complaint is that it does not allow for separation from the ""stress"" measure so that I can track the O2 individually. Fix this so that I can use it for what I wish to and I will give you 5 stars."
"Love the app but the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I can't sync it to Google fit, so all my exercise data can be together, in the same respect I can't sync my other apps with Samsung Health. It would be perfect if it could be done."
I love this app. But I have a huge suggestion!! I work 3rds so my daily steps are between 2 different days. It would be really awesome if we could set the time for the start of our day. It would be way easier to see how many steps I actually get each day. Now I have to screen shot the end of my day and then subtract at midnight.
"I love this app, the reason i do not give it 5 Star rating right now is because I consider is missing a better way to log the foods with each (for rxample: barcode scanner). other than that this app is almost complete. great information, excellent programs for training etc... hope you consider adding the barcode scanner feature to the app."
"I really love the app. I love to see the results on my device after my workout is finished. I do have some questions. Does the app track my route? For safety reasons, can it live track where I am on my outdoor routes? And is there somewhere I can download more workout types. For example, aerobics or a HIIT workout? Thanks so much!"
"Good for tracking calories and macros but it's not good for me. I've been weight training for a while and now I'm trying to cut. When I first used it, it gave me a calorie goal of 1800 which is fine but it doesn't know my body goals. Eating 1800 calories in a day is good if your just trying to lose weight but im trying to lose 1lb of fat per week not lose evert ounce of all the muscle progress I've built. This app doesn't allow you to chose your health/body goals. It just gives them to you"
"Why is this suddenly asking to log in? BS reason that it will enable Samsung to provide secure backups and better service. What if backup is not needed by the user? Better service to whom? Your data buyers? Remove mandatory accounts. And Samsung responses are ridiculously worthless, just dishing out a US phone number and asking people to contact? Why? You can't understand so many written complaints? Data thieves. Same BS response received as expected. Allow to uninstall all Samsung apps."
"I feel betrayed by your update removing calorie and weight tracker. I'm a loyal Samsung fan because you have these great features. I bought your phone and your watch (gear) just because of fitness app, but now you turn this app into something useless. I'm having the worst samsung experience right now because of this nonsense decision. Please bring this back."
"No longer works after 8/9/21 update. New privacy notice requires access to everything. üò† Refused at first, but it insists. Finally gave in and granted access. Now it won't open due to unknown error (0x2A#0)."
I have always loved this app but since I last updated when I try to run the app it asks for permission to make and manage phone calls. I don't know any reason why the app would ever need to make or manage phone call on my phone so I guess I won't be using it anymore since it won't let me continue without agreeing to give that permission. I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHAT APP FEATURES NEED TO MAKE AND MANAGE PHONE CALLS ON MY PHONE.
"I always use this app LOVE it! But yesterday I used it to track my walking workout (like I do often) it got stuck in ""paused"" part of my workout??. I have updated it , and restarted my phone twice... Every thing else works but that?? Well I resorted to uninstalling it then reinstalling.... Unfortunately I lost ALL MY previous data...it is like starting over. I thought my previous workouts would be there...nope! Don't do that. Contact someone firstüôÉ"
Ever since the update it's not recording my workouts correctly. I'll do an hour cardio workout and it will record that I burnt 45 calories.
"This app sucks. I keep trying to log in and it wants to set up double factor authentication. I give it my phone number, get the code, hit verify, and nothing! Then I try to opt out and get an error message üòë"
"I used to love this app. Using my phone I could track my heart rate and oxygen levels. Now with my new note 10, I can't do that unless I spend more money on a separate device. Also, I wish it had the ability to tell it I'm sick and stop suggesting that I take a walk. I'm not taking a walk...I'm throwing up sick.....! Bring all the things that made this app great back. STOP SUGGESTING DAILY THAT I GO TAKE A WALK! I WAS ASLEEP! SICK OF IT. THEY'RE IS NO WAY TO TELL YOUR CRAPPY APP THAT I WAS ASLEE"
"Wrong information after recent updates, why there is no option to select data only from watch ? for step count . before update numbers were close to accurate but now they are just random, i travell thru bus for 2 hours and it says i walked around 16 KM. please fix it. i am no more able to track the correct activity"
"Love this App, the auto tracking is incredibly accurate. It also tracks your sleep, stress and and heart rate. It's a shame as I was looking to pair a Samsung Watch with this App but due to the HR issues on Samsung watches I am thinking of either buying a Google phone, One Plus or Huawei. I will miss using this App, I love it."
"This app already barely gives you any useful information without paying, but the new update is completely unnecessary and invasive. There's no reason a fitness app needs to have call management and will refuse to give you access to the app without it. Guess I'll be finding a new app. Extremely angry that I lost access to all my progress."
"Does the job ok, still things could improve. Feels a tad messy Also, maybe my rating is affected by before i got a samsung active i tough it could messure bp.. Also, find it odd that samsung cant make futures in last update avaiable on older models. Guessing snorring, etc could use microphone to extract data. But samsung seems to love to forget about older gen. Be it a tv, og smart watch.. Only give newer things new futures, even tho its maybe not a hardware issue. Am i 100% wrong about this?"
"Perfect again! (Sarcasm) So, first they asked for our phone number for ""together,"" now you're FORCED to set up 2way verification to use the app, TO USE IT, so I guess I wasn't the only one not happy giving my number that they had to make it mandatory! Well, I have 3 watches, I guess I'm giving them away, finally free of this developer. ""This will keep your health information safer,"" dude! You're just tracking my workouts and heart rate, you do not have MY health information, laughable!"
I have revised my review now that Samsung Health wants permission to make and manage phone calls. Why does a health app need to make and manage phone calls?? At least the step counter shows up in my notifications so I get some use from the app. Reading the scripted responses from Samsung they claim they need my phone number to identify my phone. Does that mean if I change numbers suddenly the app won't recognize my phone? I don't think so
"Stuck with 2F authentication, it's not letting me login without 2F & I am not receiving texts from Samsung on my mobile number."
"I loved using Samsung Health across each version of Samsung Galaxy, but apparently many of the features do not work anymore on Samsung 10 5g. Heart, Stress, etc is not directly avail on S10 5g. Team 2nd time advise it's no longer avail and you must now purchase a wrist monitor device to sync data. Then told via here to contact Australia Samsung for third time to address the issue (am I going around in circles!?) Ozies told me these features not compatible with latest S10 5g. Sadden by the lost."
"Samsung you ruined a perfectly good app with the latest update. I use to import data from other apps to track/trend because I liked the Samsung format better. Not anymore. Look at all these reviews, you need to roll back this update and try again. Maybe this time have someone that actually uses the app on a regular basis design the update."
"This app sucks. It stopped getting data from my galaxy watch and reports 0 for ALL of the steps captured without the phone, yet reports that the data is coming from the watch. There is no way to reset or address this issue in the app. It sucks!"
Works great with the Samsung watch app
"Really? Ads within the app? It is absolutely outrageous that samsung has started embedding ads in nearly all of their stock applications, including Samsung Health. When tracking my fitness, I don't care about 3 free months of Sirius xm or pre-ordering the Note 20 (especially since said ad is showing up on the Note 20 already in my hands!) STOP THE ADS! To the developer: a giant banner across the top of the app advertising 30% of a hyper ice massager is not an advertisement?"
"Please fix your app permissions because I can't sync to and from s health after the update ver of 2019/8/26 Update: 2019/9/1 there's a way to bypass the permission issue by activating the app's dev mode. Go to samsung health settings>about samsung health then tap on the version number quickly 10x. You'll see the developer mode label in front of version number, go edit your data permissions then you're good to go"
I am very disappointed that both blood pressure and ECG are not available in my country for galaxy watch 4 üòû
"The app has gone kablooey over the last few days. It keeps defaulting to mobile phone when I select ""show step data"" and when I change to ""phone and watch"" it cycles endlessly and never shows the step data."
Will not use with the new permissions required. This app will never be allowed to make or receive phone calls for me. The reason for the request is immaterial there is nothing I want from this app that requires my phone number. I have had a long string of issues with Samsung products and support which is why I no longer use their phones and now I will no longer use your apps. It seems I am not the only one who has an issue with the required information either.
"Very disappointed.. The steps don't sync with the phone (despite saying the watch is synced), lots of functions that one day worked minimally well have disappeared in the latest updates. Will change it for another brand."
"It works... BUT IT'S SO FRUSTRATING that there are ALWAYS Global Challenge CHEATERS that ruin the entire concept for EVERYONE... YES... REALLY! There are people who are THAT PATHETIC! Samsung should develop a way to kick these idiots out. Also, I think it would be cool if there were more narrow challenge options like country, region, state, city or zip"
Love the app. But can we somehow get a friends group challenge. it only allows you to challenge one person at a time. it would be nice and fun to be able to challenge your friends in a group setting.
The latest update has removed monthly and weekly views from most of the widgets. The whole point of having continuous monitoring is to have the ability to compare your health metrics over time. What is the point of this If I do not know if am doing better this week than last week or last month. The steady cut in features from this application is making it less and less useful each day.
"You keep ""assuring"" everyone that you having permission to MAKE CALLS, and view contacts is necessary to make the app as useful as it can be. How about EXPLAINING how you being able to make calls on my phone will make this app more useful to me. I don't make calls, send texts, or use the telephony features of my phone while using this app so why do YOU need access to those features? What does you having access to calls and contacts ADD to my experience with this app?"
"I am currently on home oxygen and also have portable tanks that I have needed for well over a year now due to serious lung issues resulting in my outlook being terminal. I rely on this app greatly to check my o2 levels throughout the day and it has been always super easy and very accurate. I have used the app moments before my nurse checked my o2 with the finger sensor and we came up with the same readings, same with the heart rate. This app has saved me many times by letting me know my oxygen level was below 90% when I take a break from my oxygen. Thank you for creating such a useful app. Wish it would check blood pressure so maybe something to consider in your next update."
"Before last update, this would have been 5 stars. Now someone decided it would be a great idea to take off weight management, which was the reason a lot of people used the app in the first place. I'll change my rating to 5 if you restore it since it was the only reliable app I could find for this, but PLEASE BRING IT BACK."
Good app generally but major issue with step count recording when riding motorcycle etc means it is hard to challenge friends fairly. Seems like if you are moving faster than x mph it should be smart enough to NOT count steps.
"I used to love this app. I'm very disappointed that I have to give the app phone call permission, which I will not give. I will gladly use app again when you allow us to deny this request. UPDATE: Regarding re-apply. I understand this as I have seen this canned response on similar reviews. I'm still NOT granting the app phone call permissions; furthermore, if I were I would be very unhappy with all my contacts being loaded as MY contacts do NOT need to know what I put in this app! So disappoint"
Used this app regularly over the years to track my fitness and especially my weight using my history as a reference. That seem's to be all gone. All my weight history vanished. Why can't they leave this app alone instead of over bloating it with stuff us mere mortals never ever use. Please could you create a light version with just exercises and a weight tracker only? Or I' will just stick to my alternative app.
"It's a terrible app. I walk for an hour every morning with my dog. Every day when I get home,Samsung Health informs me that it has detected 13 mins of exercise & therefore hasn't recorded my real step count. There's no point really, is there? I prefer the free Pedometer app that does exactly what it says. Far superior to this nonsense."
"New update is too intrusive. V10 was just as it should be. I would rather pay now for a less intrusive app as there are not many good health apps around. Very disappointed with Samsung. They have really taken advantage of people with there latest update. I have already paid Samsung a lot of money for their latest phone and watch, so should not need to give up further information to them to make money off me."
Rather clumsy app. Reasonable attempt but did anyone notice the graph for running shows the faster the pace the lower the line whereas the walking graph shows it correctly. Please fix the Y axis on the running graph then worthy of 4 üåü
"It kinda works but if you don't have the normal ""dayshift"" life theirs no way of changing it so that sucks. So if you're like me and work/live the nightshift life everything resets at lunch time. Would like to see a update that fixes that but like everything else nightshift gets screwed."
"It may seem silly, but I have found this little, free app to be incredibly motivating and fun. I've lost weight and lowered my cholesterol and have a good time competing in the challenges and with my friends. It's great."
"FISHY. After an update a 2step authentication is required. So I put in a phone number. Then I put in an sms verification code. Then another verification page appears so another sms and another verification code and then again. All of a sudden ""Hidden Number"" calls my number. Shows steps but when I run it it always ends with a request for my phone number! Shady ad suspicious as hell."
"The only reason why I used this app was for the pulse ox meter. ""New phone, what dis?"" means that it doesn't do that anymore. So happy I can uninstall this bloatware. Edit: Not gonna ""reach out"" because the HARDWARE doesn't support the ONLY feature I used in your app. Send me a new phone that has the hardware support & I'll use the app."
No matter how many times I reset my password it won't let me get past setting up two factor authentication. I have tried multiple times now and it always says my password for my Samsung account is incorrect. Terrible app breaking bug. Fix it or just take it off the store Samsung.
"Since the new update i can't use it . I'm not giving permission for contacts and phone calls ... whatever the reason is. I have used this app without that permission for a long time , I should be able to have that choice even now .. I'm deleting this app because of the new update .. Yes I understand the below reply but I dont want or need that and haven't used it . You should give people the choice...."
"I used to love the this app so I recently updated to the Galaxy watch 4 with the intention of tracking fitness. Super annoying though that the most random fitness activities or specific machines are listed but not basic weight lifting? Or HIIT training? Or just cardio? I find it wild to think that someone would ""start a new workout"" between weight sets."
"I hate this app after the latest update the fonts are so small... you have white font on top of light green, can't even see it in the daylight, fonts are too small now,... I'll be looking for a new app Edit: well I tried it for a little bit now after this update I have removed this app from my smartphone why in the world with Samsung health want to sneak through permissions to manage and make my phone calls I don't download help applications for phone call snooping! I'm done with Samsung help."
Since the new update the month/week view for weight has gone. Its just set on daily. How do i change it back or view it as a month's view? Surely app updates are meant to make improvements and not make it so basic that i want to uninstall. Now to search for a app that actually lets u see all the important info! So annoyed. Year's worth of tracking all gone down the drain!! Bring back month and week view! Edit: downloaded google fit and will start tracking there instead
What ever you did with this last update you have ruined the app I can't even go back and look at other days now!
"The last 3 updates you have done to this app has crashes the ECG function on the Galaxy 3 watch. This latest update had rendered the ECG USELESS! FIX THIS!! Also, you're forcing us too sync our phone contacts or we can't see our partners steps that we are teamed with! That's bull. Forcing people to ""sync my contacts"" is #$&@*""# There are many other apps that sync with the Galaxy 3 watch, I'll be using those from now on!"
"Excellent App with an excellent community. It keep track of all the important t data, and it motivates you to keep going. You can even try to beat your prior performance."
"My original review (same rating - unacceptable permissions) disappeared - I was invited to contact support in the app. Since it's unlikely that I am going to give those permissions I wonder how they expect me to achieve that. With regards to the copy&paste reply to 98% of the 1*star reviews here: the app seemed to work happily without those permissions before, so the justification makes no sense. Finally, developer contact in the app store: no.reply...@ - you really can't make this up."
I have always loved this app. I use the O2 sensor and or the heartrate monitor every day. The O2 sensor has dissapeared! please bring it back. I uninstalled and reinstalled thinking that would help but it still was not there... Help Please I don't want to use a different app. Thanks for the feed back!!
"Updated after a while, now asks phone call permission and the two-step verification is unable to get past the first step (repeats infinitly). Why add all the useless stuff when I have superior biometric on the device? And data as my bmi and how much i walked a day is a senstive stuff.. like hell it is!"
"Global Challenge: please add different types of challenges you can do with others and show when (and at what time) each star on the map expires from day 1. Removing cheaters isn't easy, but at least ban (or give a number of warnings before banning) those from the challenge with humanly impossible step counts. Great app with a lot of opportunity."
"Loved it until the update. I use this app daily. I hit a milestone with my health and wanted to compare to 6, 8, 12 months ago. Optiion the see weight history by weeks or months is gone. Can now only scroll on a dail by day, and it is not user friendly. So disappointed. Update 03/2021- sleep is no longer tracking with watch."
"I have been a Samsung fan for 15 years and loved the addition of Samsung Galaxy Health features of sensors to measure Spo2, HR, stress. This feature was very helpful to my family when my son contracted Covid 19 and was a long hauler. I m so disappointed that this app don't have these features with newer phones like S20, S20+ etc I'm ready to return in my S20+."
"Since the update, the app requires a Samsung account and a logon to perform any measurements. I trust only my health care provider with my health information. As a result, the heart rate sensor on my Samsung S7 can no longer be used at all. The app is now worthless to me."
Wonderful app. Earlier I was using Google fit to track my fitness data. I got Samsung galaxy watch 4 only because it supports Google fit integration. But after starting to use this app I feel Google fit is absolete. Every data provided is crisp and precise. Thank you for the wonderful app.
"Until this recent update, I would have given 5 stars. This update removed the Oxygen sensor and also broke the connection with the app my company uses for our health tracking. Please fix this!! Edit: the connection is fixed, but the o2 measurement is still gone. I really want that back! Edit: the O2 measurement is hidden in the stress one which makes no sense to me. Due to my asthma, I sometimes need to check my O2 levels, it has nothing to do with stress, and BTW that sensor is never right."
"I am using this app since last one year its shown the correct walking & running information in auto mode but from 20 July 20 its not showing the running performance information in auto mode. So, its my humble request kindly update the auto mode running features before like."
"I'd give this app 0 stars if I could because it no longer does what I want. This app came pre-installed on my phone. I used it to track steps. I could open the app and see the number of steps immediately. I updated the app on 2/5. Now it shows a login screen when opened. I don't have and don't want a Samsung account. I don't want a ""community"" or anything else the app offers online. All I want to do is count steps. Back to my old Fitbit Zip."
"would be nice if it had romanian translation for the food intake part. i do not know every ingredient that well plus the different food types we have other than the US citizens. some friends do not have the same options to join the global challenges for steps and such. Would be nice if i had reminder for the :""don't skip this meal of the day!"" or premade usual recipes of my own."
"September 3 update: Keeps getting worse. Now it bombs out every time I try to enter food. Followed your genetic instructions to clear storage, still doesn't work! Removing weight management, the one thing that made this a 1 stop shop for activity & calorie management, makes this app the same if not worse than others. Don't bother to cut/paste your response for me to call your developers. YOU take this & the rest of the same reviews to your developers. Such a shame for a previously great app."
"awesome app, love the tracking of everything! But I do hate one thing about it.. The Samsung health global challenges, awesome idea but horrible implementation! The highest winners of the challenges are clear cheaters! who in the hell walks over 200,000 steps in half a day? someone who puts a watch or samsung phone on a shaking device to rack up steps. Seriously Samsung? just ban them from Challenges for a while and they will get the message!"
Have serious issues with the app. Was enjoying it before the last update my walk steps would automatically count and summary sent daily. But nothing like that now which is quite upsetting as I can't record or keep tracks...please resolve!
"App is still broken a month on. I REFUSE to make another ticket to report issues. I have reported it publicly here to disgrace you! Seriously I am considering ditching Samsung products, you broke your app and DON'T fix it, tracking is f...ing pointless now. Watch, phone forget it all broken and useless. If you're thinking of switching to Samsung products, as decade long Samsung fan, don't! When a superficial aesthetic update renders functionalitly useless and they don't fix it. Shocking!ü§¨"
"What is this awful update??? Where is the heart rate monitor?? What's the point of having this phone without being able to use the heart rate monitor. This was the best option of this app. I never was an apple fan, but I think I'm gonna switch after 10 years of Samsung devices. The Heart rate monitor is a MUST HAVE!!!"
"I used to love this app. However I got a new samsung phone and while it seems to have most of the same hardware, I can no long do things on the app like check my heart rate, stress levels etc. This is particularly annoying since it is one of the most important things I use the app for."
I use this app with my Galaxy Fit watch and too often they don't sync correctly. Eg yesterday my watch had over 8000 steps but the app for some reason only shows 2000. When it syncs correctly it is a very good app
I am extremely disappointed with the August update... i don't understand why Samsung removed weight management section from the app. I presume serious fitness freaks were all following that content and one could easily track his progress! I strongly oppose this and would request to add that section at the earliest. I have never seen any company to remove its pros!
"i like this app, i use it to track as much as possible. I REALLY wish there was a pregnant setting on it, that way heart beat, calorie intake, weight, activity etc could be put in correctly. ETA The programs like baby steps to 5k would be great if you could add in the equipment used. Such as a treadmill. It won't track it at all if you're in the program and on a treadmill."
The app has never opened on this device. I get an error message that the app is temporarily unavailable every single time and to try again later. Even after recent update. Still doesnt work.
"Loved the app until the last update which now asks for permissions to manage phone calls. Why? You are a fitness app, not a calling app. Very very disappointing... Thank you for your response. I still think it needs to be optional. Hence I deleted the app. Thank you."
"Enjoy using the app. However, with most recent update on 10/04/2022 when I enter my sleep time it automatically adjusts to Eastern Time even though I enter it as Central Time (US). Very annoying and frustrating. Please fix."
"000 if I could. You so didn't like my rating and removed it, so I'll write it AGAIN .. in order to sell more Samsung products you have ruined a great app ... used to be able to record & track blood pressure and O2 through the camera; now you have to get the info from another device and hand record it to the app. Also, extremely inaccurate step tracking, walked 20 steps but the app says 240! I had used this app since 2017 to help my doctors monitor and manage my COPD , but now useless!!"
"Update to privacy is so invasive! Why does the health app need access to all my contacts, phone, camera and video. Out of control. And now it won't allow me to access and I'm stuck on accepting the privacy. Terrible experience."
Whatever site they get the food from needs to be updated. I have to input almost everything manually because it's usually missing some of the micro nutrients. Happy with the app otherwise.
"Intrusive spyware. Requires permission to control everything on your phone including your phone calls in order to count your steps. I have their exercise band and now I can't use it without submitting all of my usage data. This is a very indecent tactic. We should leave reviews for Samsung exercise bands to alert prospective buyers about this forceful intrusion of privacy before they decide to buy Samsung products. Customer service bs response of ""we won't share your data"" is beyond ridiculous."
"Used Gear3 for 6 months then updated Gear and Samsung health, the step tracking does not download properly, the watch is no longer seen in samsung health. I have reset everything, reloaded software multiple times. I wrote samsung online, spent 1 hour on the phone, and wrote a review on the call. Samsung has been no help. I spent $300 for a fitness phone that lasted 6 months!! Should have bought a fitbit, next phone + fitness watch will be apple. I am getting tired of caring a phone to exercise."
"I had not updated this app since Mar 2020, I didn't want to lose the tracking they removed. Now I updated my phone and can't access the app so I updated it. Now I'm being forced to share my phone number for 2 step verification. I don't want to share my number. You know what true security looks like? Not saving passwords or credit card #s in apps and sites. Not giving personal info for corporations to hold. Your requirement for my phone number is against my own personal security policy. STOP THIS"
"Why can't you just give us the opportunity to create our own ""programmes""? Feels like the app are for newbie with all the pre-done stuff. I just want a program with days and in those days I want to be able to enter exercises or custom ones if you don't have them. Then I just want to be able enter number of sets and reps for each exercise. Take a look at JeFit, they know what they are doing. Everything is always for the runner, the cycler or the newbie. Nothing is ever for us who's in the gym, lifting free weights or using machines. The most simple thing of all, that every gym tells you to do (write down sets and reps so you can watch your progress), you don't have. Please implement that, and create an app for the watch so we can enter sets, reps, and change or look for what exercise we want. JeFit have had this for almost 10 years now. But I want that in Samsung Health with support for I put from Galaxy Watch üòÇüëåüèª"
Constant access denied. Uninstall reinstall does not work. Imagine if you had to call customer service because every app did not work. Clear cache doesnt work. Seems others are having the same issue. Around app permissions.
"Why would you take so many features away? You're going backwards with the app, very disappointed with this update. It was nice to compare my previous months heart rate trends, but you took it and many other features away that people enjoyed. This makes me want to ditch my Samsung watch & move on to other options. You would be doing your customers a service to take the app back to its previous version, otherwise your review score is going to continue dropping badly."
"Another dissatisfied customer. You don't need to be able to access to my phone calls to count my steps. Feel sad that I have a Samsung watch and have used Samsung phones for years, and now this will be my last phone because of this. If that is what an optimal experience looks like, you can keep it."
"This app is just about perfect, but I do have just one thing that bugs me: why for the weight training activities can I not specify what weight I'm pulling? Reps are great but what if I want to see what weights I was repping? Also, for Together can we please challenge friends to more than just steps? Perhaps calories burned or Distance or something? That's it, otherwise, I ditched FitBit for Samsung Health, I love the comprehensiveness! Thank you :D"
Absolutely love the automatic sleep time counter! Sometimes it's hard to remember what time I went to bed in order to measure how much sleep I've gotten so this app is a life saver. It's also accurate with the times as well.
I have used this app for some years to track my basic health. It would be good if you could include as blood oxygen as something that could be recorded and tracked. I have now discovered that both the Stress Tracker and Heart Rate do not have an option for me to record or test them on my S20 Ultra. How do I rectify this?
"No other app could've made me happier! I've been using the Huawei Health for a year now, but I changed my fitness watch and experienced a culture shock after I used Samsung Health! It's fantastic! I'm absolutely happy with how comprehensive it is. It spared me the trouble of downloading multiple apps by having everything I need! I salute you, creators! You did your job well! Thank you!"
"Will no longer operate without permission to make and receive calls. Seems silly that an activity app would require those permissions to operate. I also can't uninstall, as it's just another bloatware on my increasingly disappointing Samsung device."
"I decided to go to a Active 2 from Fitbit. Love the change except the software tracking is like going from an HDTV (Fit) back to a 8"" black and white TV with 2 channels(S health). The graphics are very generic, there is little customization, the challenges are lame at best, who drinks 8.4oz of water, well thats how you enter water in S-health, there is no community function, I am so disappointed. Samsung, please but a couple of engineers on this and bring it up to date."
Generally and okay app. I find the sleep totally inaccurate. Usually shows I didn't fall asleep until 2 hrs after bed. Would be nice to be able to customize the heart rate zones.
"It has its eccentricities (occasional reloading to get everything to show properly), but I like features like the monthly step goal maps. I'm super competitive so being behind the pacer flag really gets me moving."
"I have a Galaxy Watch, does this app use the GPS on the watch? No! Can I get it to sync and show my activities? No! What the hell is going on? Oh, nothing. Don't you perceive this as a problem? No you need to buy a better Samsung product (More expense then). Additional: The developers have just sent me a reply to the above review inviting me to discuss their product with a phone number that, I am pressuming is for North America (I have spent enough buying this white elephant, I don't wish to spend more money discussing what to do with the massive pile of excrement that it has caused) and a handy email link to Samsung Electronics Ltd (a link that is a ""No Reply"" address (so about as much use as their product then!)"
"Sleep tracker will sporadically record the times when I removed the watch as sleeping, hope you can fix this."
This app connected to my Samsung Galaxy watch has been incredibly buggy. Recently it has been telling me I'm falling asleep while I'm just sitting on the couch watching a TV show. This is about 2 hours before I actually go to sleep. Last night it decided to tell me that I slept from 7:00 a.m. until 4:00 p.m. this afternoon which has not happened yet. I woke up at 8:00 a.m.. it is making so many mistakes. I've restarted both my phone and my watch and I'm not sure how to resolve it.
"Whatever this newest update was really ruined things. I recently got a Pixel 4a 5G, everything worked fine on that phone, with this app and Galaxy Wear. Then I cracked the screen and got a replacement (same phone) through insurance. Now I can't log into this app, just get a spinning wheel of doom. My Galaxy Active watch connects fine, works fine, but I can't log into Samsung Health, rendering my watch damn near useless. Please fix this. Whatever y'all did in the past 48 hrs -- take it back!!"
"Fantastic app, easy to use, great integration and accurate tracking. My only complaint would be the lack of flexibility in macronutrient settings, but otherwise love it."
"So I thought I was the only crazy one that was surprised by the permissions request, this kind of practice should be illegal to all Android developers. Runtime permissions are that, runtime. If someone doesn't use a feature that needs a permission then the permission should not be given. Period."
"The widget design is a huge step backwards and requiring a samsung account login ""for security"" is a jerk move. I have a $900 samsung phone and $300 samsung watch and suddenly I can't use them together without samsung spyware. Update: your response doesn't even address my concern. I know an account is required now. That is the *point* of my 1-star review."
"I use to love it, but since the last update it just doesn't work. It glitches when you're inputting the food, it's just frozen all the time, the step count isn't workoing as well as it used to..."
"Latest updates killed it for me. Cannot even open app now without giving permission. Sorry, Samsung with so much hacking etc going on.. You do not need all of this info. About every review here is complaining about the same thing. I do not wish to give access to my contacts or any other info. Unless you change this.. I have uninstalled the app"
"Don't bother downloading this app. Took away the sensor to measure stress, blood oxygen levels & heart rate on the Galaxy S21 FE. I will be deleting this app due to this. It is no longer useful. I will not buy their fitness tracker to pair with it. I will stick with my Fitbit that all family members have to do challenges. Sorry, your answer is not sufficient. Basically we'll do better next time? Not helpful at all."
"The app doesn't sync with my watch 4. The exercise info such as steps, calories, etc is not transferred to my phone. Please fix the bug. Cmon Samsung, you are multi billion dollar company."
"It will no longer check my heart rate or stress level. The screen displays the directions to place your finger onto the sensor, but the sensor does not light up red anymore and no measurements are recorded. üëé"
"Im so disappointed about the new update! Honestly the only reason why im using samsung health is because its weight management features, its a great feature to track my calorie intake and expenditure to reach my weight goal. Since the feature's gone i never use or check my samsung health anymore. Samsung health also the reason why i bought samsung device! Please reconsider to bring back the features. Thankyou"
"I'm amused that the app developers don't want to be contacted by email but rather by phone. So I'm going to leave my suggestion here because they obviously read these: please modify the sleep tracker to allow for gaps in sleep. Example: Asleep from 11pm to 5am, and again from 6am to 8am. (I would also make use of some sort of gamification/reward system for getting close to my bedtime goal.)"
"Useless, they've removed the sensors from the s21 ultra, a $2000 AUD phone now has less features than the s9! Crazy only just found out. This app is no good any more as you have to basically put everything in manually. If that's the case and you have to buy a wearable, who is going to use this app? Nobody that's who!"
"I used to enjoy the app. It tracked everything. However, I decided on getting a Amazfit Stratos because it was more plausible price wise and value but this app won't acknowledge any products other than Samsung. So, it leaves me no choice to delete the app. If I'm wrong or you guys do make the app work. Please let me know and I'll be more than happy to download it and change my rating score."
So far its kept me on track and I'm way more active. Well 3 yrs later and im still doing the challenge every month and alot more . Food tracking is great and keeps me accountable . Really like seeing how I compare to ours iny age group ( I'm killing them )
"Together isn't working Overall I like the app and am wanting to utilize it more with my gear watch. However my biggest issue is the together section isn't working for me. Is there a fix for this? Or a known issue here? I would like to have access to challenges, friends, and all that but I don't. Please let me know what I need to do. Thank you!"
"My all time favourite app. I open it more than 10 times a day. Tracks my steps, calories burned and food, water, sleep, stress etc. This app was the single reason I'm still using a Samsung phone despite the challenges I had."
"Answer to this post really proves all below. No I won't call. Can't call. Been in contact with support allready but only arrogant, nonhelping answers there... Number one issues is new update you announced. STOP COPY PASTING RUBBISH ANSWERS! Buggy app. Don't sync well with other apps (if even syncing at all) and now they're taking away piece after piece, also the good ones. No web version. Little or no help from customer support, they keep pointing at others or telling you to restart/reinnstall (even though it's been tried). A few things I've been happy with in the app is the sleep tracker and Weight management. Last has - with logging in My fitness pal and syncing with S.Health been a real good help for me. Now I read that this funcion will be removed from next version..?? Earlier the community was removed. Soon there's little left to actually like. Feel stuck with this app since I bought Galaxy watch active 2 earlier. Really starting to regret this, and wishing I'd chosen something other than Samsung. Probably won't make the same mistake again. This is poorly from such a big company."
"Keeps telling me I need to allow permissions in settings, WHICH I DID, changed nothing still can't get it to work. Do I have to accept the ""optional"" marketing promotions to get past that step? Also doesn't count steps at all & tells me to get moving when I haven't even sat down all day, so not sure pedometer is pairing correctly with my watch."
"Upon purchasing this phone I loved the fact that I could open the app a see my statistics. Now, I have to allow permission for apps I WOULD NEVER use this app for in order to use it. No. I enjoyed logging my info and simply tracking my steps/workouts. I am not pleased with these updates. What Samsung is asking majorly minimized my use and optimized nothing. I'm uninstalling this and looking for something else."
"App is great, works really well with the Samsung phones (of course). Syncs well with my Pixel as well. But a major issue is it drains the battery with Android 13. Resting battery drain is approx 10% per hour."
"Sleep tracking is so inaccurate. This morning my sleep tracking shows that I have abot 30 minutes of deep sleep just before I woke up. That is the same time I was hitting the snooze on my alarm every 5 minutes. No way I was deeply asleep. It also has me falling asleep about an hour after I went to bed last night, even though I feel asleep pretty quickly. I would like to be able to trust this sleep tracker but I just can't."
"Used to have it as a fixed feature in the phone, what the F happened????"
It's great to have this to track my steps and diet. I would like it if there was a period tracking mode (that does not sell my data) and a way to add steps because I don't always have my phone on me to trach steps so it misses a lot of my steps.
"Wow!! New update proves Samsung Health App team are on top of their game. With updates to both Health and Fitness. These updates bring it on par with some of the best health apps out there. I use the Samsung R805 W and they have tweaked the Supercharger to Max Boost on this one! Wow * Stress Meter included in this update. Thanks for the long hours and commitment to staying on top. Just like me when I'm training with your gear. Regards, Mark"
"Really? ""Samsung Health"" app updated Mar 2021. 1-Same as others: the removed weight stats was what I used the most. 2-What is the single most tracked body measurement in these times of COVID-19? TEMPERATURE! I don't need the app to take my temperature, I need a place to log it. For everyone not ""WFH,"" this update missed the obvious. I'm a nurse, I work for several companies who require my temperature in their state mandated forms. Under ""Manage items"" can you please add a temperature tab? üßêThx"
I had to remove 2 stars. I am on the weight management and it keeps saying I'm over my calories but what I have burnt so far is 1200 and what I've eaten is 800 cal sofar. How is that possible????I think you guys could add more options under the food section so that we could accurately log our calories. And there has to be a better way to log exercises. Otherwise I love this app and use it daily :)
"Since my husband started including this app into his healthcare plan back in 2018, he's lost about 50lbs. This app has proven it's worth in his very successful endeavor, so we were disappointed to find that the weight management feature was removed in this weekends upgrade. At this point, all this app does now is keep track of steps, sleep and water intake. It was the weight management feature that worked for us and set this apart from the many other health apps. Please look at these reviews about this upgrade and see for yourselves how important Samsung Health in it's previous forms was to Samsung product users. It earned 5 starts before, but only 1 star now."
I've used this app for some years with no problems but the latest update wants access to my phone and if I don't agree then I can't use the app.Hello it's a health app and you are not getting access to my private information I don't care who you are. I notice other users have commented about the same issue and Samsung reply is oh we need it enhance your user experience. My reply to that is it worked fine for me prior to the update. I have now deleted the app
"Great app that works well with the Galaxy Watch 4. Only criticism is for the food database. It is pretty rubbish and you are limited to 100 recipes. Link to My Fitness Pal is the best bet to overcome this. Frustrating that Archery is not able to be added to the Galaxy Watch. Especially as it is the National Sport of South Korea. Would love to see this added, along with being to customise it to your draw weight."
I agree with Mandy. Your two step verification explanation doesn't work for me. I should have the option to except it deny this. If I feel that my security measures are adequate I should be allowed the option. You're making this very difficult because now I'll have to find an app that will work with my Samsung Watch.
"I love this app because it helps me to keep on track with steps food water intake and I also connect my Samsung gear sport , also participate in challenges and monthly challenges. I been making 10k steps a day at least since using this app. And also as a gym goer I count my macros and ability to input food intake comes very handy as again i need to make sure i stay in calorie deficit , so i Highly recommended this app there are endless options here."
Overall nice app. Would be good to have medicine recording as a separate feature instead of buried with blood pressure recording. It makes it hard to record medication alone they way it was in the last version.
"Why have you taken so much away from this app. As poor sleeper I liked to be able to see how well I was sleeping, rhat is gone. I loved being able to be able to see calories intake and remainders as I used to over eat hugely, this has now disappeared. Please return the app to it's version prior to this latest update! Otherwise you'll see many people go elsewhere, including me! Bad move guys"
"Epic fail update. I now can't access my app because it keeps giving an error code and there's no access without a new two step verification using my cell number (and extra permissions?) I can't get in, can't access my info and can't link my watch the the app right now. Why weren't users informed ahead of time that this change would be occurring? And before you respond with ""please go here for help"", I did. There is nothing at the website that offers a way to help."
"App requires two factor authentication to work, but it hangs when trying to set it up. Latest update breaks the app and doesn't work anymore. Good job breaking the app AGAIN. Highly doubt the outsourced company that codes this app bothers to do manual QA testing. The second part is the app REQUIRES access to my contacts. Not providing this permissions means the app wont run. I dont care about that function of the app. All I wanted was to keep track of heart rate and SpO2 levels."
"I just got a samsung smart watch and really like the look of this app. However, my main form of exercise is a kick-scooter and that isn't an option for tracking. So I can't really fully utilize this app."
"Why in hell do you need a sim card for this garbage? I had to install all 214 of the samsung wearable apps on my retired phone and link it to that after my frontier watch stopped connecting to my daily use phone. Since my old phone is retired, it has no sim card. Which aparently means this useless app doesn't feel the need to work. Once again Samsung, thank you for nothing!"
"Altitute very wrong on hiking/walking (although strava works fine), Samsung help number could not resolve issue. How can same device, galaxy watch, work well on strava for elevation, but so poorly on S Health? Thinking of switching to Garmin. I see a new response asking me to call after doing some steps to resolve, I have done all this before and called and was told there was nothing that could be done to fix this by s health via that phone number (as mentioned above)."
I have used this app successfully for years but now it is totally useless unless I give it permission to use my phone. I have read the unhelpful answers to others with this complaint. Giving the app permissions to perform unexplained functions is NOT something I want to do. Give me the access to my data and to the functions I used to enjoy and leave the phone permission out of it.
"Weight Management feature removed... why????.. how are you supposed to know whether you are on track in losing weight? I would've given it 5 stars prior to this ""update"" which is a massive downgrade. Collusal step backwards Samsung. I would give it 0 stars if I could now...... I will give it 1 star until this feature is restored. Come on Samsung"
"I used to love this app. Doesn't work the same with active 2.I used to burn near 600 cal during my circuit trainings and since I changed watches now I'm just at 200 for the same exercise. I thought it was the watch, I tried endomondo today and the calories burned are more accurate between 500 and 600. Conclusion is not the watch is the app somehow. And their response is a 1800 # I don't need to call is all over the web it doesn't work and needs to be fixed we are all having this issue"
Keeping me up for walking more. Helps me track my eating habbits. Variety of challenges help me keep moving every day. I hope more challenges are added every month to motivate users to run more. It is helping me in losing weight and maintaining my daily intake and work out. I have lost 4 kg by using this app in last 2 month.
Honestly started taking care of my health and this has been really helpful. I like that the food has the brands and just basics incase you can't find the brand. Although I would ask you remove the women's health part on the menstrual cycle. It would be more inclusive to just menstrual cycle tracker or maybe feminine health to be more inclusive of trans people
I'm more into looking deeper into my sleep and overall health..especially now that I bought my galaxy 4 smart watch...I love setting goals and trying to beat them now..I do wish there were a few more things you could do on here to sync with your watch and phone though..
I dont like it because it asked for my personal phone number to verify the sign in process. Its not like a rocket science app that needs access to so personal and sensitive information. I find this requirement offensive without having the possbility to change it with other 2 steps verification. BS!
"Overall I like this app. But I am SO annoyed about the idiotic design issue with the sleep tracking. It regularly thinks I am asleep when the watch is on the charger. And then the app asks, ""Were you asleep during this time?"" But there is no way to say NO to that question!! Why in the WORLD would you ask a yes or no question, and then not give us the ability to answer with a no??? Edited to add, the developer contact info listed here is a NO REPLY email address! That is just wrong üò°"
"Adding my voice to the others who complain that a fitness app has no need to access the permissions it requires to work. After paying several hundred dollars for a fitness watch, it's disappointing that they subsequently update the software with unnecessary and intolerable privacy concerns that essentially limit the functionality of the watch and make it a useless app. Dear Samsung, please rectify the privacy issues raised here or send me back the $400 I wasted on your stupid smartwatch."
They changed history. No more defining days. Its lumped in weeks and the days are tiny text. Google ruined fit in one clean swoop and Samsung will chip away at killing health. Devs change good things just for the sake of change. Phones get bigger and the fonts get smaller. update...fonts are even smaller on home page. Mowed lawn for an our and it gave me 18 minutes activity time. Junk
"It's not a very intuitive app miles away from a fitbit app or Microsoft health. Samsung watches are quiet good, it's a shame that they can project this data well in their app. I hope they take this feedback, they should seriously rethink their UX."
"I used Samsung Health with a Gear Fit II for nearly 4 years and loved it. My Gear just died and I replaced I with a Galaxy Watch. Samsung Health does not allow a Galaxy Watch user with to designate the watch as the sole source for steps. At first the only option was the watch-phone hybrid method which over calaculates steps by about 20%. Since my original review, , I uninstalled and reinstalled the S Health App. Now, i can also choose the phone method. Can't chose watch as source. That's sad."
Authoritarian app permissions. Do not install this app. You do not need access to every bit of information on my phone to track how fast I run so that's a solid uninstall until this is fixed. Plenty of great free health apps that don't seek more access than the NSA. 2 factor authorisation? How bad do you think hackers want to know how fast I can run? It says in the description this is a marketing ploy to advertise to contacts so no thanks. Sort your invasive app out.
"I have a Galaxy A20 and the app says it ""Can't connect to the network"" I am on WiFi and cellular."
The step tracker is no longer syncing correctly with the watch. First noticed on 1/10/2022. I rebooted the phone and watch and removed and reinstalled the app. Did not remedy the problem.
"Why does a fitness app need permission to make calls? And why do I need to accept marketting and promotional communication to use the app? I did buy a Samsung phone already, remember? I was very enthusiastic about trying this out, installed it. But I just cannot use it without these permissions! Such a shame. Uninstalled it in 2 mins! Fitbit is the best!"
"This app no longer syncs my workouts to my discovery app. For the last 2 months I have not received my vitality points because of this. I've updated both apps numerous times, and they still are not syncing"
"Excessively drains my phone battery overnight ever since I switched from Samsung to another Android phone. I eventually had to disable it, losing my Samsung watch's primary functionality. Such a shame as I did appreciate the information it gathered from the watch about sleep and steps."
I really don't want to wear two watches. I like my watch 4. However this app does nothing for me. Fitbit grabs how much water i drank from my water bottle. Fitbit grabs all my nutrition stuff. Why do i want to spend a majority of my day on my phone doing data entry when it could to everything for me. Since Google owns fitbit they should encorporate it into the watch 4.
"Given up on this app, too many lost features like weight management. I've now sold my Galaxy Watch and swapped to a Garmin because of how poorly this has been handled, and how poor the responses have been from the developer. All we've seen is feature after feature lost, and vague requests to let the app team know about the poor work, and requests to keep the app updated. Bye Samsung, you lost another customer."
"11/2018: The new update isn't very good. 08/2021: Doesn't have feature parity with Google Fit and the lack of syncing between the two, especially when apps only connect with Google, is a shame."
Just Uninstaller this app. I cannot for the life of me understand what would make the experience better because Samsung has the ability to make and manage my phone or why they need my contacts. When and if Samsung decides to respect my privacy let me know and if I have not gone to another fitness tracker and phone then maybe I will give it another try.
"Only the most basic information. No elaborations. It doesn't even show all the information the watch is collecting like where you rank for your age group or among other users. I love the watch, i hate the app. They could take a lesson for Fitbit's app"
It's been over a month and still no word on when the weight management feature will return. Prior to the latest update I would have given this 5 stars üåü but since the update the weight management section no longer displays.
"My steps are not being tracked at all.. or very little. This is getting frustrating. Edit: as suggested, today alone I've done it 3 times!!!! It works for a few mins and stops again."
"Loved this app, but what have you guys done? No longer can I put my finger on the sensor. I didn't care about the weight management part but you guys are totally taking away everything about this app that's good. I literally gave you a 5 star review until your last update. I can no longer even hear when I've walked my miles or am almost there. WFT? Don't know what to do now, guess I have to find another app that has the features you guys keep taking away."
"Loved this app before. I have read a lot of reponses from Samsung health stating the phone persmission is used so we may have the most optimal experience. Can you explain how? The app doesnt allow us to use it without this permission, is that what makes the statement true? What is the benefit to the user? In what scenario would access to the phone come into play? Like unsolicited robo calls? People seem concerned about you collecting more data. What are you using this information for?"
"After the update of this app today, I have deleted it. I used to use this every day and loved it. Now it needs to access my contacts and manage or make calls on my behalf in order to operate? For what? And Samsung, your BS reason about optimizing the experience is just BS. If you have no intention of doing anything with my contacts, why ask for them in the first place? So disappointed!"
"End of a beautiful thing, I have been using Sheath for quite sometime now until 2days ago an update popped up and wanted permissions to my call and contacts, naturally I said no (I mean, y do you want to get into my contacts for. Nothing I do has anything to do with that) what do I know, next thing I can't get into the app no more. I go to settings and can see it's not a mandatory option, I understand location, coz how else are you going to track distance walked/ran. Anywho app is now deleted!"
"I've been using this app for years. I've seen it lose function over time. I have Galaxy Watch3 which HR sensor. I have a cadence and speed sensor on my bike. And I can't use both together. I either get HR from the watch or get cadence and speed from the Wahoo sensor. And they sell those watches as fitness oriented. Yeah, right."
Update WARNING! Oxygen Measurement Capability Removed! Thanks to everyone who mentioned that this functionality has been removed for Canadians in latest update. I will never update this app ever again to keep my current functionality until Samsung decides to bring back the oxygen reading capabilities. I bought a phone with a heart rate and oxygen measurement sensor for a reason and you should no be allowed to just remove that functionality at a whim.
It would be nice if Apps like these were shift worker friendly. Every time I manually input my sleep times I keep getting told to keep a regular sleep pattern. I work at different times of the day so I can't sleep at the same time each night and I am not skipping on sleep just to get up the same time each morning.
This app was in the beginning absolutely fantastic. Then it started its updates. Getting worse by the second. This is absolutely the worst app now on the universe. If I could give a negative star it would have been a -100 star. To be able to keep using the app I now gave permission to access my calls and contacts. But let me make myself VERY clear. The very moment you are using my information against my will and principles I WILL and SHALL report you.
"I'm beyond sick of this app CONSTANTLY asking me if I'm sure I want to run the app because my ""GPS signal is weak"" even though I'm in a wide open space in a major metropolitan city. Yes dammit, I always want to run the app! I live within 20 miles of the George Floyd murder in the Twin Cities area of Minnesota, how can the GPS signal there be constantly ""weak""? I want a way to permanently turn that alert off and make it so that it always runs the app without that stupid pop-up question."
"The new 6.15.1.003 update is garbage. The new design is anti-intuative. Instead of getting a percentage score you now get a lemon that fills up - that tells you nothing about how balanced your nutrition is. You used to be able to see how many grams of protein or fiber you have, now all you see is a line filling up and you need to get to two other screens to see the actual numbers. The previous version had far more superior design - all the information was clearly in front of you - üëéüèªüëéüèªüëéüèª"
"Edit: Giving 5 stars again because they added it back! They disabled the oximeter in the last update, I assume it is a craven attempt to force people to buy smart watch type stuff instead. This could kill people!! I have been using it successfully for years, now I'm sick, need to use it, and it's suddenly gone. I really appreciated this app before"
I have a Galaxy Active2. There is a problem with how the app tabulates my sleep report.  If I am awake and.leave the bed it has a gap in the report and does not calculate the sleep score properly.  The score is then useless.  It adds up to over 100. Please correct.  Also a light background grid marking the hours on the sleep display would be nice. And why can't I get BP measurement. Is it because I don't have a Samsung phone?
"It used to be amazing app, suddenly it stopped working and crashes everytime I try to open it"
"I like that the app has every running statistic I could need. Downside is that under workout history's ""notes"" the app will only let you type 50 characters. I would like to see this number improved so that I can input more notes about my runs."
Love the app.recording food is easier then others I have tried.and everything else super easy love that.however the steps are way off now. They use to be close.and now not recording ..the other thing maybe to add could be a manually enter for steps as it doesn't pair with my device.
Excellent app. I used it for two weeks now. I lost around 2.5kg weight. Cons: Some of the kerala food items are missing. I manually add the item with calorie sothat I can use it anytime once I entered.
"Sudden change in previously great Samsung Health is not working well for me. Tracing trends is more obscure and unhelpful while loss of the Healthy Pace option means that I could be falsely satisfied that incidental walking is good enough, whereas previously I tried to incorporate at least 10 mins H P each day.Now that is not recognised. As I'm in Australia, telephone calls regarding my concerns are not so useful due to time difference. At least there was some comfort in knowing that others don't like the change. Such changes need to be road-tested before delivery."
"I have a Samsung S3  and this phone is not compatible with the app , I now have a Samsung A3 and I get a message that I need to update software , I try to but the phone already has the latest soft wear loaded , I have a gear fit Pro 2 and I have been battling for 2 months to get this watch and either phone synced . Fit Bit is a much better app"
Does a great job integrating all health data.
I loved this app until you removed the option of seeing only steps counted on my gear sport. It makes the step counter useless now and I'm actually pretty mad about that as it's an important part of my day. And I'm not going to call you as it's crazy expensive to call from Europe. So just fix this!! Now.
"I don't have the option to use body sensor on my s10, so i can't check heart rate, stress e.t.c. how can i fix this please"
"Ever since this update my phone completely drains within 2 hours from 100%(Yes everything is off on my phone, no tracking, Bluetooth...nothing). Since this update, I can not use it for anything, not work, sleeping or working out. What is going on?"
"I have an issue with this app. I have diabetes and use it to log my readings. If I forget to log my night time readings, the app won't let me go back and enter them in the morning. If you back the date up a day, the whole app shuts down. Other than this issue app is very good."
"Error that doesn't work on rooted phone. My phone isn't rooted. I forced stopped, cleared cache, reinstalled and nothing works. Don't bother replying and apologizing Samsung, or giving me a 855 number like you have others. Just fix the problem! *update* Surprise, surprise, I got a generic response like I figured I'd get. NO fix... Zzzz *update 2* Obviously they didn't read the review and just provide generic responses. Reinstalling will provide the latest update (and yes its the latest)"
"I hav installed in vivo app it's not working properly ,everytime it's going in pause mode totally disappointed with the app üòî"
In past used this all the time and would give 5 star. Since getting my new s10 it would work. Been in touch with Samsung support as requested numerous times but not got any answers. Thats if they get back to you. Told to reboot and other simple thing I tried before calling and told them so. Disappointed but not wasting anymore time will look to another app.
"Set up 2 step verification - I hate this! I'm unable to get past this for whatever reason, I always receive message with code, enter it and that's the end. It does not allow you to get past this point. What the heck is this? Also why why why do you need access to my private list of phone contacts???"
"I've been using App for a while and liked it but now it insists on mandatory access to my phone which I will not grant. It's not necessary and invasion of my privacy. Good way to kill your product Samsung. Your assurance regarding my privacy will not change my refusal to grant access. Product previously worked fine without this permission for over a year. You do not need this permission, I will never grant it, product use terminated. Totally your fault."
Sleep tracking has been broken since October!!! Workaround was to install an old version of the app to get it it working again. Today Samsung made it so that you can't continue using the app unless you upgraded... and SLEEP TRACKING IS STILL BROKEN IN THE LATEST UPDATE!!! People play hundreds of dollars for products like the Watch Active 2 and it's crazy how much your GARBAGE APP ruins everything. DO BETTER SAMSUNG!!!
"Last Update Broke Sleep Tracking. It downloads the sleep time from my Samsung Watch 3 but the sleep stages are empty and all say 0% in the app on the phone. However, they show properly on the watch. It was fine before the update."
"I read the privacy notice and uninstalled. Your latest privacy notice needed access to my phone? For what purpose? So I read the notice since I had to agree to it in order to use this app. Turns out you basically take all my personal information and use it for whatever you want to. You no longer have my permission to do that, I'm out. I've been a long time Samsung user and you are driving me away from your product again and again."
"It was a good app but they started to request permission to manage phone calls. Reason for that: ""Samsung health uses your phone number to help friends find you and invite you to challenges."" As I do not want this feature and samsung is not letting me to use the app without permissions, for me is not a good app anymore. UPDATE TO REPLY: Samsung you are not listening to your clients. But is ok, as you make this decissions, we can also decide not to use this app or your products anymore."
"Samsung really wants my phone number so it can ""help friends find me and invite me to challenges"". It's decided to force this by suddenly mandating two factor authentication on a step tracker. It loses another star when putting in any number results in a ""failed to send SMS"" error message."
"The app try to use 2 steps verification, so it send the code to my number but nothing happend after several attempts. It even said that I entered wrong code too many time (which the app automatically enter after received sms) and will make a phone call instead."
"I manage to register my Polar Verity Sense HRM to Samsung Health after going into settings > accessories > scan accessories. However Samsung Health still unable to sync the workouts. I've enabled all the necessary permissions, clear cache. Hope you guys fix this or respond to this complaint."
"I downloaded this app on my new phone because I enjoyed this app so much. Now, since I've downloaded it, the app only work til mid morning and quit. Two days later and I've walked 0 steps according to it. I do not recommend wasting your time to download this app. I'm deleting it. Furthermore I agree with many others review about this app. Once great now it sucks."
"app works great, well stocked with popular food items. my only feed back would be for the ability to add entries in the days ahead of time. would be great for people who plan their days out in advance and know what they will be eating. this would allow you to plan your week out and make any adjustments to your diet plan."
"I loved this app until a recent update that requires me to allow Samsung Health to make and manage phone calls. Why???? I used to check my O2 saturation, stress level, pulse, and monitor diet and water intake. Please remove the ridiculous requirement for the app to make and manage phone calls. There is no logical need for this!"
"I am absolutely disgusted with Samsung over this. I have this app connected to my watch and today while with a patient in work as a healthcare professional a notification pops up from this app to ""f*** me harder"". This is absolutely unacceptable!!! And when I tried to get in contact with the support team I was told to reset my watch?!"
"You would think with all the bad reviews, that you would fix the problem with this app. You have crammed in so much useless stuff, that it no longer works, as it did. You can use all the excuses that you want, but you do not need the info that you are now requiring to make this app work. Nor should you have to sign in with a 2-step Verification. Very disappointed in Samsung. And quit giving the same BS response to every single review!"
I remember this app being so useful had so many different elements to it. I could check my blood pressure I mean I'll have to do is put my finger up to the red light and it would measure some which different things. Now things are being taken away you can't do this you can't do that then it's quite useless to have.
"Update: April 2022, having issues again with syncing to myfitnesspal. I'm not sure why this keeps happening. Please fix this. Please do an update so I can sync to myfitnesspal again. It won't sync any of my data now. I had this issue yesterday too. This new update is terrible."
I was in the market for a new smart watch as my Garmin is getting old. But I am glad I read the reviews so I am aware to steer clear. The response to most complaints is that there are no ads (Google description in the playstore states there are in ap ads) contact customer no service or to frequently check back for an update( with updates being one of the biggest complaints.)
What happened to getting O2 levels with thus app?! It came with it and now its it's gone!
the new version doesn't give an option to count only the steps from the watch. it only provides mobile or all so all double counts if you have your phone on you. completely useless.
Update took away the heart rate and stress monitors. That was really the only useful thing about the app. Now my phone is equipped with a feature that is completely useless.
So if you put the phone step count on pause. You get the actual watch count. The watch works great with the phone and fitness trackers. I am pleased. I have a s10e. And it seems to be working well.
"Using Health Sync to sync data to Google fit from Samsung Health. And the permission is not working. Cannot remove the permission and re add. when I try to remove the permission, it is not actually turning off. This only started happening today."
"Great app till this week, when all of a sudden they request access to my camera, contacts and phone. Otherwise it doesn't work anymore. So... Uninstall and good-bye Samsung health. I will also think twice before buying Samsung products in the future."
"As far as I can determine, the ekg and oxygen measurement functions for Samsung watches are not authorized for use in Canada. Based on my search of the Heath Canada database, I was unable to find any evidence that Samsung has applied to have these functions approved for use in Canada, which makes this app and the watch much less useful. Can someone from Samsung confirm that there is no intention to have these functions approved for use in Canada?"
"Does not install correctly and is abusive re notifications and permissions. Received an explanation of what I was misunderstanding regarding the app from the developer. Thank you for the quick response. Back to ""liking"" the app. The help may be good but on reinstall on a new watch, not worth the abuse."
Upgraded from a Note 9 to ultra 22. Can no longer take pulse thru the app. I have at watch 2 and 4. Neither records correctly thru the app. Believe it or not the 2 works better than the new and improved 4. Your devolpers need to go into hiding!
"I understand that you need the phone permission for a new feature but why force it upon all users, why not make it a choice. If you want to use the together feature THEN you have to give phone permission. I'm sick and tired of apps forcing me to permit something for features i'm never going to use anyway. Just let me see how many steps i've made today and let me rest in peace and if not there are many other apps that would do just fine without me having to grant them 10 different permissions."
I've use this app for years now when running with my Samsung and really appreciate it. I don't understand why it stopped counting my accumulative distance at 106 marathons?  I've fund equivalent to about 112 now but only counted to 106. I miss this feature as I routinely use it to challenge myself so I makes me want to look for another app to track my distance. Regards Simon
I used to love this ap! Used it daily now it sucks! When I got new Samsung 21 I can't figure out how to use it. Everything I google says it's in sync with your watch or other accessory. I don't have now will I make a purchase of these gadgets. I want to have the capabilities to measure as I used to. Steps don't even track appropriately. At this time this ap is useless & just taking up room on a page!
"Removed tracking for heart rate and o2 and now requires me to give permission to access calls. You should be ashamed, Samsung. Ps. Don't reply to this saying it's to personalise the experience. While you say it doesn't use the permission to access calling, you do not need this permission for this app, find another way. You know this isn't acceptable. Uninstalled"
Still we cannot pause / resume steps from main notification bar..that means i cannot pause / resume steps from main notification bar of the phone. If i want to pause / resume steps i have open the Samsung health app.. I have been using this app since 2016.. Still its not fixed Please make it fixed..
I bought a Galaxy Watch 4 and got this as a companion to it. So far I really like it. I wish you could scan barcodes in order to enter food though. That would be a really great improvement.
Update: after research i have realized this is not only me and the issues are due to the most recent watch software update. My husnand now has the same problem. I already called the 1800 number and they couldnt help me. please come up with a better response. my treadmill workout totally messed up my day in the app. you should be sure the people using the app know they cannot use certain workout equipment ahead of time.
"I had used this app to lose 80lbs in a year, came back to find it downgraded. It required intrusive extra permissions for functions I won't use, then forced me to set up 2-factor auth which I don't want as there is nothing sensitive tied to the account. The real killer is that I can't enter meals ahead of time anymore, which is a HUGE detriment to me as I meal prep and enter meals ahead of time extensively. Now I have to 2FA sign in every day to log meals I knew I was having last week."
"I have always loved the the Samsung health app. 5 stars all the way, until the sp02 check was removed for some reason. I know it's still available if using the stress test, but why was the stand alone test removed? I know it's not a common thing for your consumers to buy a Samsung galaxy device just for a pulse ox meter but for me, that's why my wife and I made the switch long ago and have remained loyal ever since. Please add the stand alone oxygen test back!!!! Thank you, Samsung Customer"
You removed the oxygen meter which I used and you put it with the stress meter. I and many other note 10 plus users dont like less for our money. You should have added to the app not mess it up. I suggest you add it back in as an update. Because I just got my phone and many other note lovers use that app but may have to find another if your going to remove features we like.
"I'm more disappointed with Samsung health than ever!!!!!!! NOT ONLY CAN I NOT SYNC STEPS AND ACTIVITY WITH OTHER APPS, THE LATEST UPDATED VERSION STILL DOESN'T HAVE THE WEIGHT MANAGEMENT FEATURE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This is absolutely made the app very much USER-UNFRIENDLY. It is actually ridiculous. They better step up their game and bring back the weight management feature and IMPROVE the app rather than make it a headache to use"
"This app was workimg just fine, then somewhere between July 30th and 31st it stopped recording your activity time achievements. Why did they stop that, i used that to stay on track. They need to bring it back. üò©"
"I don't understand why I can't use the app unless I allow permission to my phone, contacts, camera, and files. There is no reason why this app should have access to those permissions and I will not allow those permissions. I will find another app first."
How do I get it to only count steps from watch. My only 2 options are watch and phone or just phone? Last few days it's been doubling my steps. I think it's adding my phone and watch together. When I click there is no option for watch only. Updated I tried calling and was told that the watch and phone will combine steps which makes no sense bc it hasn't until 5 days ago.
This was my favorite and most used app on my phone... until... the latest update. I can't say I've ever seen anyone take a really good and well functioning app and remove all the best parts in one update. Not sure how you handle weight management now. This is the poster child for how to make a 5-star app a 1-star overnight.
The removal of the weight tracker was a massive mistake! I have been using this function for years (and had years worth of history that I valued). This is some over the top PC rubbish. Can't I at least get my history sent to me? I'm crushed that all that data is gone! And now I need to find a new health app that is all inclusive. BRB. Going to swap my Galaxy for an IPHONE.
"I Uninstalled this app because I can no longer get fitness data unless I give the app permission and access to my contacts and allow it to make phone calls. These is ZERO reason this app needs to permission to that stuff unless it plans on soliciting my contacts. Which I will not allow to happen. So therefore, this app is useless to me. You decide for yourself if you want to give those permissions."
"Wow !! This WAS a fantastic app for counting steps and basic weight tracking untill now. The new update is way too intrusive. Permissions, samsung account, 2 step verification/phone #. All of this for counting steps ? Why stop there, might as well ask people to tell you their eye color or what car they drive or what they watch on TV. You never needed this info prior to update so why now? Do you really need this info so that I can count my steps ? Anyway after years of use I'm uninstalling."
While the watch has a lot of features but the application does not provide a good historical data to user. Been using all top smart watches and Samsung smart watch application is the worst. Quite disappointed.
"This app gets worse with each and every update. It took away weight management last August, and now can not log in without giving unnecessary personal information. It's useless to me now and has downgraded to the point that there are many other better apps to use instead. It is a shame because I used to love this app."
"Latest release causes massive battery drain issue on Samsung S3 watch. Making battery life less then 10 hrs vs 2/3 days. Samsung ignoring issue has no solution. Horrible support for what could be a,great watch. Followup - sent watch in 3 times for service. They have no solution just replace battery. Calling your DEVICE support number is useless. Need to listen to the massive number of complaints on your support site regarding this issue!!!!  This application and the DEVICE work together so you should be talking to your DEVICE people and testing this before you roll out a release that caused problems.  You both keep point fingers at one another while your customer base gets for dissappoints."
"I love the app, but why don't you have weekly or monthly summaries for weight anymore? I record my weight daily to get an average over the week and I can't do that anymore. Other than that it's a great app I always use for recording exercise, sleep, weight and heart rate !"
"App asked me to update. Used to be the Best fitness tracker I've had-5*. After reading the reviews of the latest update, I will wait. After the update this app will not only be useless- as it doesn't do nutrition food tracking or meal planning, but you're forced to login for it to work and your information is sent to some data center. No thanks, I value my privacy...Sorry, not updating until you put it back to the way it was. And if you force the update, I will uninstall and use your competitor."
"Remove SpO2? really? bummer. I bought this phone for that feature. Im excited to buy Samsung Galaxy Watch Active 2, but now, maybe Samsung Health is not the platform for me. RESPONSE: Well, it's not available in Canada. So all in all, you just stripped off Canadians (and people from countries where Stress Management is not available) the ability to measure anything related to SpO2."
"I used this app for almost 2 years since I got my phone, but deleted it when their latest update blocked me from using it unless I agreed to give them permissions to my phone that were neither necessary or proportionate. From other reviews here I see Samsung is not giving any explanation other than a vague, copy paste promise of ""optimal user experience"" which makes the whole thing seem even more suspicious."
Updated software keeps giving notifications
App is very good but not working according to my opinion. It's reading the step count on bike.
Still has ads in the health app. Ridiculous for a premium phone like the s20. Samsung has denied there are ads but there is a massive banner covering a third of the screen. I have opted out of everything but still they persist.. Samsung replies with same old response. How many times do reviewers have to tell you there are ads on the health app before someone actually picks up a Samsung and looks????
"I've been enjoying the App for a long time. However, I have to uninstall it because of the latest update. Now the ask for the permission to see and use my contacts and phone calls. I'm sure the majority of people would rather uninstall the app than give this permission. It was nice to know you, but I prefer to wait until you change your policy. Goodbye, SH."
"You can change all measurements units except for arguably the most important one, calories to joules. This is very frustrating for anyone outside of the USA and it makes me hate getting their smart watch."
"Not very user friendly, and sometimes glitchy. There's options for Women's health which is fine, but nothing for Men's health. Overall it works, it tracks, it links with my watch."
"Two step auth is trash. You will habe to uninstall and then reinstall to get thru setup. Once it finally sent me the code, it wouldnt work. Sent code again, then it made me start thr process all over again. Now that i am in and the days activity has been erased, it no lomger counts all of my steps. It may or may not count half. Thanks Samsung for ruining a good app. If you can avoid downloadmg the update, do so because it is garbage."
It's a good app however I prefer the older version where I could check my oxygen level and heart rate without having to get the premium. Now I guess it's all about the money not the individual.
"I used this on my S10 and it worked fine but recently updated to S21 and have found that the walking exercise for distance goal related part is faulty. It frequently ""pauses"" with no reason and then i need to stop my walk and press ""resume"" which is frustrating"
"I used to love this app. Recently it stopped opening automatically. If I don't open the app each day it won't record my steps. I uninstalled it, restarted my phone and then reinstalled it. It still doesn't work."
"*EDIT* One star removed (now 3 stars). When entering a food item it asks for daily value percentage for micronutrients. The problem is it takes these numbers as milligrams instead of percentages.   So, I entered an item that had 50% of my daily iron per serving, but it converted that to 50 mg of iron and put me in the read zone for daily iron consumption.   Please fix micronutrient food entry.  *Original* Please add a more robust weight lifting module (exercises, weight, sets, reps) to this app and it would be the absolute perfect health and fitness suite. I used to use Google Fit, Loseit and Progression, but Samsung Health has allowed me to eliminate Fit and Loseit. Developers, please look at Progression or Jefit apps and add something like that! PLEASE! Thanks ;)"
"Why the hell does this app need to make and manage phone calls to work. There is no reason any app need to decide if a phone call i make is valid, healthy or unhealthy.  And even if the app thinks I'm dieing I don't want it to dial 911 and have no other reason whatsoever I want it to make a phone call."
"I love the app and it's features, but it defaults the start of the week to Sunday with no option to change it to Monday. That messes up my ability to track my activity time and workout history accurately ever week when in the US our weeks are Monday to Sunday, NOT Sunday to Saturday as it defaults. Please fix this and give the user the option to select which day we want the week to start on!"
Firstly i want back the 2019 version where you had a circle bar showing actual calorie usage and more. Since then this app getting more n more dumb. Not good. I will never understand why you are fixing something what is already good. This version is terrible wrong. Shame on the people who approved this version. 2. Hellooo. People asking why access for calls. You should answer the question dear samsung. App sadly disabled until you give back the 2019 version. Bye
"4 days after installing it, and after it's first update, the app is asking me for my account details (email and pwd). The fact that such an insubstantial app acts in this way (why the heck do you force me to have an account in the first place) is an indication of how broken the app space (and lawless data collection) currently is."
"App fails to keep track of each of my w/o times. I add my accurate time for ea w/o to the notes. Therefore I m not getting the credit I deserve. Ive kept a calendar of my w/o's since Jan so I still get to see my progress.... I like the general idea of this app,but must have a more accurate timer. Thanks üòä"
"Updates. Hi. I have used Samsung health for many years. I have liked it until the new updates. Why can't I see the distance I have covered during/after cycling? I can only see the time taken, which I can work out. Please return the ability for us to see the distance covered and the map where I've been cycling."
"Another update and it still wants to steal my phone number. As always I will not be blackmailed into granting permission to use features that I paid for when I bought this phone. heart sensors and other health features have not been working for over a year because of this on my $1,200 phone. Samsung locks out other apps from using the sensors so I found this app that uses the normal back camera to take pulse. still most features don't work related to health. This will be my last Samsung"
Just bought a galaxy fit and had to install a plugin from Samsung to make it work with their Health app. Now the Health app will not open stating I made unauthorized changes to my phone. I tried all that while on the phone with a Samsung rep. Was told I would simply have to wait until an update to the Health app. Any eta? Update 1/22/20: Health app is still not working. Called Samsung several times with no help repairing the issue.
"coming from a fitbit charge 2 + Huawei p9, the Samsung S21 phone + watch 4 experience has been very disappointing. I don't find it at all intuitive, and both watch and phone need charging every day if used for any period of time. having to carry a power bank for longer hikes."
"Latest update has ruined this app from being a solid 10/10 now only 5/10. The sleep tracker, which used to be reasonably accurate, now has me being asleep through out the day, Now I may not be the most active person in the world but even I find it impossible to believe that I have been sleeping whilst driving to work and whilst in work, my boss really would have mentioned it üòÄ. Developers need to look at this or roll the latest update back."
"overall it is pretty good. all the food measures are in metric, making it worthless. Update: now I can't open the app at all. I'm left with a watch I have to charge every other day. Weak sauce. Watch sucks. Dead after a couple years. No diving, no extreme shocks... Just bricked itself, like several flagship Samsung phones before. They make actual garbage, I'LL NEVER BUY FROM THEM AGAIN."
"The app is forcing me to share my phone number with Samsung for features I don't want to use. Without verifying my number, the whole app does not work. Along with it some basic watch functionality is unavailable, even though it used to work without the app and does not need a phone number (sleep tracking). This is a violation of GDPR by the way. I am never buying another Samsung product again."
"Getting worse with every ""update"". Unnecessarily changes in display. Please revert back to the simpler Activity & Sleep Monitoring graphs, instead of a quirky abstract pattern. Weekly Summary is also incorrect, with a wrong Target displayed. WHY ????? Software Professionals, please justify your existence more meaningfully. Don't make silly changes only to justify your jobs."
"I have just started using it. what about the daily core activities? working in office also burns calories, and I don't get where to log that. job profile should also be added and intensity of work one performs throughout the day. after a hectic day at job, it still shows you need to burn more calories. don't know how to manage."
"This app, that i love, has not recorded my walking steps for the last four days, i tried updating it, but while the update worked the steps were still not counted which is very frustrating !! I have tried reinstalling to no effect, i am in the Uk so can't call your US phone number before u ask me to do that. Please advise, Thanku"
My android keeps telling me it uses much battery. I keep getting little/quick notification every few minutes of my gear S2 syncing data. really annoying. Also: I can't sync it very well with runkeeper
Had this app for a while since I have a Samsung phone & Watch. Now suddenly it needs phone permissions?? ABSOLUTELY NOT!! This is such an egregious overreach. Now my cycle tracking info is being held hostage by this? Dont use the community feature & don't plan to. If this isn't changed ASAP I'll be deleting & finding a better app. This one wasn't that great to begin with. PS. Have read developers responses & they are unsatisfactory IMO. Clearly many people don't want this!
"Way too many people CHEATING on the monthly challenges and Samsung doesn't care! Edited 8/6/20 it's been almost a year since the response from Samsung responded to my complaint about cheating, people are still completing the events the first day! EDIT #2: After receiving a prompt to ""review the app"" again and my complaint is still the same. I've never seen a app so chill on such outright cheating! Just sad üòî"
"I like this app but it's so basic. I can't really use the food tracker because I can't change the macros. I would like to be able to control the carbs, fat, and protein to fit my lifestyle. SAMSUNG please make the macros changeable."
I installed app yesterday and created account. As at this moment i have been unable to open the app at all. After logging the app goes nowhere. My wife uses the app on her phone with no problems. She logged an emailed help message to which there has been no reply. Would someone at least try and explain why it wont open on my phone.
I'm not happy with the service offered to me by the customer rep... I made it clear that I'm unable to retrieve my weekly summary report of Oct 2018 till Jan 2020... Could some1 from the Samsung Health team contact me via phone or do a remote diagnosis. I made sure that my app was auto synced & all info was backed up... I'm giving a poor rating as I'm appalled by the service.
I really just use it to count my steps but it has a lot of cool options like tracking your heart rate and sleep. A great app if you're trying to be healthier and keep track of things!
"Update: I can't contact you as u suggested bcoz i cannot access the application due to error i am getting. Also, I have tried everything (removing cache, data, re assign permissions , force stop, disable/re-enable) I just bought new phone and haven't changed any settings yet. But when I open samsung health, I am getting server error 0x2C#1#-1. I reset my old phone and setup samsung health on it, and it works fine so i am sure that it's not server error."
"What lots of others have said. Used it, loved it, update requires phone permissions, so no deal from me. I'd add that the ""privacy policy"" I was sent to said nothing about what they would use the phone for. I am suspicious enough of tech companies in this matter that I suspect they're hiding something."
Got a new phone and the app stopped working. Kept asking for multifactor but whenever I entered the code it would freeze. Have had two phone calls with customer service and they were not able to solve. Feels like Samsung should refund my watch since now its useless and will not connect. The Bot that replied to this message obviously did not read that I have already contacted customer service (twice) and never resolved
"Complete violation of people's privacy. Requests access to call logs and full phonebook for basic functionality, like viewing your friend list. If you deny access rights the app won't work."
Weight management features removed?! Are you for real? This was most important feature on your S Health app. The only reason I used it for last few years and bought a samsumg watch! So I can manage my weight in one app. Well looks that watch and the app is fit for bin only! Great! Does anyone at Samsung have any idea what is required for health and weight management in the app? Absolutely and truly disappointed.
Worked fine until there new update which asked permission for them to manage my phone calls which stated it was optional so I denied. Now it won't let me access the app at all. Don't know how they can say something is optional but if you say no you won't be able to use there serviceü§îü§• will change my review score if this is taken care of but an app you can't even use is worth less than a star
"Now look. I don't say I don't like this app. It's just maybe my phone that's the problem. It keeps on telling me ""No Simcard detected. Insert simcard and try again."" And it looked like such a promising app. Oh well. Guess I can't have everything I want. Not with this stupid phone of mine which is blatantly refusing to accept this gr8 app. Sorry. I'll hav2 uninstall it."
"I can not edit food added in the my foods. I set up pills as a my food to add my supplements the amounts did not show right but i am unable to change them. The app will not sync with fit bits smart watch, rempho scale or omron blood pressure. I understand you want to sell your own products but this is why I do not buy Apple. The 1/21 upgrade seems to have been done by people paid more by the competition than Samsung. Is there a way to revert to the old version?"
Over the last couple of weeks Samsung Health has stopped auto tracking my sleep. I uninstalled the phone side and it worked for one day but is once again not auto tracking. I checked all of the settings and cleared the cache but was unsuccessful.
"Really great app! Almost has everything needed. Would be great if it would track body measurements too though. Also, it would be great if women could track menstrual cycles through the app for weight/bloatedness comparisons too."
"I know it was never accurate, but since the latest update it is even less so. My husband got a legitimate pedometer, and I mentioned that I felt my steps were being calculated improperly. His pedometer counted almost 1,200 steps more than this app did, and he took less steps than I did that day. Very disappointing that each update seems to do this more and more"
"I loved this app and used it everyday until the new permissions. I will not be granting access so I guess that relationship is over! Samsung... I am not interested in your generic response, so don't waste time. I hoped that with so many complaints, the permissions may have been revised before I added my 2 cents worth. Obviously not... take heed Samsung, your customers are not happy!"
The app reading of my walkouts are very accurate.
"It is now requiring phone access or else you can't agree to the TOS. How creepy and ridiculous! I don't want this app accessing my contacts. I will find a new app that is more considerate of my privacy. Samsung assures me it is needed to provide ""optimal"" user experience...How so Samsung? Why do you need phone access to track my sleep and workouts? Why can't I opt out of it? Companies get hacked all the time... Uninstalling"
"This app is wonderful but not supported by anything! Noom, Google Fit, something... Anything! I don't want to get rid of my Samsung health watch, as it's awesome to track lap swimming and all other activities, but if the data is not read by my other apps, it's way less useful!"
"What's with the stupid 2 step verification update? Now the app won't let me access my health data or the other features as it keeps on looping between the 2 step verification page and the OTP page. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling, but the problem persists. Need help."
"It's one of or the best healthcare apps out there in the market, plus for free! just one issue is about the sleep info, it is not exact, sometimes it will be 3 hours incorrect or 4. anyhow you can change the time manually."
"Latest version is draining battery on Android 13. Samsung please fix this! UPDATE: Cleared app cache and rebooted, didn't fix battery drain. Uninstalled and reinstalled app, same problem. Looks like the app is preventing my phone from going into deep sleep. This needs to be fixed!"
"There is only one way to connect Watch 4 - through Samsung Health (no way to connect it via Wearbles app), but it's lost it registered status in 3 weeks without any reason and I need to RESET Watch to connect it again. It's ridiculous that Watch 4 can't be just paired. do not buy this device."
"Why take the weight off the app, iv now lost all my progress that was tracked over the year and it was useful to show my doctor the progress in was going, absolutely ridiculous that it has been removed. Sick of samsung now, phone contract ends soon and won't be back"
"Doesn't seem to track as much as it did before. I got a new Samsung Galaxy S22, the Samsung Health app doesnt seem to track anything like heart rate, blood oxygen and stress, what happen?. This app is completely useless! If I knew it was so different from the older version I would not have gotten this phone."
used to be able to search for many different foods that had all the valley and nutrient information there already now nothing. If you want to keep a calorie count you have to enter all the information yourself. way too time consuming. Other than that everything else works well.
Nice app! I wish I could log poly and monounsaturated fats as well though.
"Updated 11/5/20 I'm not liking that my workouts aren't being tracked correctly and showing up on my app. I have 4 workouts this week that include a few runs and they aren't showing up which then affects how my fitness pal app calculates how many calories I'm allowed. Previous: I like the various workout options but what I looooved about the Fitbit app was that I can scan a good product and it would pop up for food logging. This app doesn't have that, you have to manually enter the items :/"
"Issue still not resolved of two step verification after entering otp also shows the same page two step verification not able to enter in the app mob sensors became useless plz remove the two step verification older version was good did mistake by updating. Even tried with clearing the catches, force stop and reinstall problem is the same"
"I have been an chronic insomniac for 35 years and hoping the new sleep feature will give me some great tips. I truly love this app. I have hypothyroidism with goiter and Hashimoto, so everyday is a challenge for me. This app has helped me a lot and has made it easy to keep tabs of my progress."
"Will not work now after updating without creating an account. Fail ! Un-installed 6.15, reinstalled 6.12. Back to working without account or login. Still zero stars. Edit response to response, No need to contact you it's not an issue with my settings, it's your new retirement to have to create a Samsung account to get past the splash screen/ login/ register page to access the app. This is not issue before on version 6.12 & earlier. Let me know in response when you remove login requmt."
Can no longer measure o2 during sleep with the Galaxy watch 3! They removed it from the app latest update. Still no blood pressure monitor with the watch in the USA. Come on. Keeps taking away instead of adding features
Just purchased Galaxy Watch 5 Pro and it doesn't log my sleep data. I had a Galaxy Watch 3 classic and that worked perfect. Blood pressure app is not installed on my Watch and not sure why. You pay a chunk of change and Watch the promotional online event snd it says it will do all of this. It's not right to mislead the public. Please get back to me to tell me how to fix these issues. I have had the Watch for two days an setup many Samsung watches with Samsung Health. Phone is Galaxy S22 Ultra
"My activities aren't syncing with Strava. Sometimes 24 hours, sometimes a week and some not at all. It's a lucky dip. Please assist? The phone number below comes up as disconnected. Ringing from Australia. Please assist again. I've written via Samsung help and my questions have been deleted twice now. Someone please respond. (OCT 19) Nothing has changed, still no assistance (NOV 19)"
I switched to this app from Fitbit when I got my new galaxy tracker. Tracking nutrition is too difficult. It needs to be able to scan bar codes using camera like Fitbit. Would also be nice to manage from desktop using website.
Cannot support multiple low energy Bluetooth devices. If I have my heart monitor and my speed/cadence sensor and my Bluetooth headphones the device no longer reads GPS my Note 10 had no problem with these devices I knew where device should do better.
"Can't log in due to the app trying to force me to use either Samsung internet or chrome as a default browser which is BS. I have chrome installed. That should be good enough. *Edit* No I'm not going to contact support. Fix your app, you shouldn't be forcing people to use browsers laiden with tracking. Because of said response I wish I could rate it 0 stars."
"What has happened to this app? I imainly used it to monitor my sleep along with my galaxy watch. It used to give me a full breakdown in the app and now it just seems to guess my sleep very incorrectly and asks if I want to save manually? Am I doing something wrong as it doesn't seem to communicate with my watch properly or has this app regressed not happy,"
"App doesn't work. Stuck in 2FA loop. I signed up for 2FA as required but it keeps telling me to sign up again but then will not let me sign up again because""access is denied"". PS to the dev that responded to my post; please re-read my review. I went through the 2FA setup but I still cannot sign in. I tried on two different devices and get the same loop. 2FA works fine on PC but I cannot sync my Galaxy fit there so . . ."
"Updated Jan. 2021 - Like many others I am not happy with the latest update. Why do I need an account to use the app? I have been using it without since I got my S9 and have never had a problem. And judging by all the comments, the features I like most are gone. So need to look for a new app. Boo Samsung. Next time think before you move."
"I generally like the UI and reliability of this app, however, this app's compatibility with other accessories is severely lacking. I received a FitBit Versa 2 as a gift and was excited to link it with the Samsung Health app on my phone so I could track my steps even when not carrying my phone. But sadly, this device is not compatible, so after 6 months of tracking my progress using this app I'll be giving it up for my new FitBit which is superior on its own."
"What happened to the ""weight management"" widget? One of the key aspects of weight loss is a deficit balance of calories in vs calories out. Your app is showing individual metrics (once you find them hidden in individual metrics) but it really lacks a good dashboard comparing what you burned vs what you ate. There used to be a ""weight management"" widget that tried to achieve it and was showing daily trends but not even this one is gone. Seems its time to check Fitbit app again...."
I lovED this app because it showed my daily fat intake in grams. I track this daily. I try to have 20 grams or less. After the update it only displays in percentage. Weekly shows an average. I wish it didn't change. ***This feature now works again. So much better. Thank you
"I loved the app until the last update! It has lost the weight management widget which was the one I used the most to know if I could indulge into some sweets or if I did how many calories I had to burn to be back on track. What kind of health and weight management has this app become without the calories management? Very disappointed!!! ****Update**** It has now been 3 months that weight management has been removed, will it ever be brought back or should I look for another product?"
It was easy to connect to other apps
"Not only the weight management is gone but I'm force to seeing how many steps I take on my notification. There is no way to turn it off, honestly it was the best app but not worth the download or time anymore because it got all mess up. Stop ignoring us and just add them in"
"when i.had a Galaxy S8+ it was capable of ""auto detect"" for my only activity i set. It could tell from GPS where i was, auto detect a workout. Now, the Galaxy 10 Note 5G, even when manually starting a workout, I'm ""warned"" GPS signal weak. I am outside my car, nothing above me but blue sky, yet GPS is weak?? What is your problem Samsung? In any case. I start my workout, but it has no clue i ended my workout. Like with S8, and so it adds my drive home at 45 MPH to.my workout."
"I just switched from fitbit- the app is comparable but- the ads in the Samsung app almost make this a deal breaker. Fitbit doesn't feel the need sell me junk every time I log a work out, why do you? I like your watch but the ads in the app really ruin the experience! Seriously, samsung, I spent $$ on the watch, the ear buds, the phone- why do you need to nickle and dime me? Seriously regretting my purchase -"
Dropped a couple stars. Total workouts this morning from leaving house to re-entering house having woke up changed for running then out. Ran 20km walked 3.6. Total distance covered should be 23.6km as the sum of the workouts. But the Active time summary says I did 26.7km. Clearly I haven't walked 3.1km in my house. Also annoying there is blood pressure and stress that are either unavailable or region locked. Sort it out! You treat each of your customers differently!
"Battery drainq & lack of freedom for calorie goals. It gives you a max instead of setting your own. Fitbitblaze taught me on avg I burn 2,500 a day based on graph data. So I want to make my calorie goal 2,200. However, I am not allowed to increase the limit; my only real complaint with the samsung watch vs fitbit. Not sure if I should have the fitbit versa or samsung but 2 weeks 2 choose. Worried about the product's lifespan. I don't want to spend $199.99 for a product that only lasts 1.5 years."
"Would be 5 stars but the most recent update, as of August 6, 2020, has made me give 4. Where did the over/under tracker for food go? That was a massive help for tracking food intake and exercise. If it comes back which it should, my review will be 5 stars but until then, it stays at 4"
"I just changed my mobile phone from Samsung S9 plus to S21 Ultra 5G. To my disappointment, Samsung Health Apps no longer functioning in my new phone. I can no longer measure my Heart rate, Blood Oxygen , and Stress levels. I wonder why??? As the apps still working fine in my old S9. Look forward to your response. Thanks"
"The app is good... When I remember my phone. I'd like to see a few more options, like being able to record interrupted sleep and a way to allow for standing still for prolonged times."
"Tried to open the app and it asked to set up the two step verification. I say ok and takes me to the second screen asking if my phone number is correct so I click Yes....just to go back to the first screen asking me to set up the two step verification over and over and over again. Also, I've read the other reviews so don't bother respond asking me to call your 800 number either....just fix your broken app."
I have been using this app for several years and I'm trying to login in a new poco mobile. Where signing in to Google isnt enabled. Page is struck and couldn't sync my old data. Error says account have been created using Google and signing in should be via Google but I don't see it takes me to Google sign in either.
When I sign in now all I get is the dreaded spinning circle. What have you done to this app? Reinstalling does not help. I'm in the UK so don't ask me to call a 1-885....number! UPDATE: Thank you - this time the update fixed it but it took several weeks to sort it. Star rating revised!
Not working The oxygen level and manage items not working. I have a new galaxy note 10 + and I cannot check my levels on the front button. Where u put your finger on the camera sensor. It worked on my note5. Cannot record caffeine.
I've loved the app for years. Never had an issue with it until recently. The app kept freezing and closing. A few days ago it kicked me out now I cannot login and just keeps loading.
Should be better. Can only record food in grams. . .let's be real I'm American I don't know how many grams my food weigh so it's super frustrating. If they just checked out apps like myfitnesspal or fitbit they could find dozens of ways to improve this app. Also find my step count to be very inaccurate. If I'm pushing a stroller it is like I didnt move. Step it up samsung.
I have been using this app for years. Liked the steps widget on my home screen. This update looks terrible. It's TOO bright and white! Used to be minimal and not dominate my home screen. Hate this change it back.
"Requires phone privileges to track you and won't start without it anymore. Bait and switch. Edit: Better experience is a lame excuse because it is forced. I care about my privacy and Samsung clearly does not. Unbelieveable in 2021. I do not wish to give identity to Health app so my data can be linked to me, infact I think this is a violation of GDPR data minimization principle. I hope someone picks this up and fines Samsung hard core!"
"Well, this morning, this app REQUIRED me to allow it to access my phone. And then, it REQUIRED me to set up two-step verification. QUIT TELLING ME WHAT TO DO, OR I'LL THROW THIS IN THE DRIVEWAY AND SMASH IT INTO A BILLION BITS BY RUNNING IT OVER WITH MY CAR SEVERAL THOUSAND TIMES. ""Deep sleep"" information has ALWAYS been completely useless, ever since I started using the Samsung Galaxy Watch Active 2, and with this new nonsense, I think it's time to go shopping for a new Fitbit. -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= After ""the app developer's"" CUSTOMER HOSTILE reply, I can only believe what many others have been saying, that the most likely reason for this change was so that ""the app developer"" could collect even more personal information from the app's users, in order to make even more money by selling that information to whoever might want it. And since the reply is SO VERY CUSTOMER HOSTILE, I now feel compelled to SCOUR THE ENTIRE INTERNET, and post negative reviews for each and every Samsung fitness device that would connect to this app, and warn shoppers about this customer hostile, customer information harvesting pile of complete garbage, masquerading as a ""health"" application. And I promise that I will at the least take a hammer to my Samsung Galaxy Watch Active 2 and smash it to smithereens, ensuring that no innocent, unsuspecting individual might get trapped into using it with this customer hostile, customer information harvesting pile of complete garbage, masquerading as a ""health"" application. And then I'll go buy a Fitbit, forever avoiding the Samsung ""health"" ecosystem."
Just been getting the watch. Currently great but won't sync with my phone. Watch is saying samsung health isn't downloaded and although my phone says its syncing to my watch it's then 2 minutes later saying it can't connect.
"So far so good! I thought weight management was deleted when I got my new phone, but then I found it under body composition. I like tracking my weight (and my Fitindex scale connects to Samsung Health app), my food and my periods!"
"I've said it once before. Yall need to add a report button for cheating. People are ""walking"" 142000 steps every day. I did the research. Even if you are running at average 3mph non stop. It's 71 miles and it would take 23 hours and 40 mins. And they are doing this every day? How do yall not see that. Fix it please. CHEATING!!! They are blatantly doing it too because yall doing nothing about it!!"
"Good app to plan for a good life style. However, recent updates are not as good as the old ones. Lots of bugs sometime in crashes, food items not listed, auto detection of exercise..."
"I have been using this app for more than a year for tracking my in house walking (steps). All this while had no issue...but lately, why does the exercise form is running üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è eventhough i am only walking. The auto detection is walking üö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è but when i view it in history it shows as running. Why & how to amend this?"
"Great & simple app layout. The challenges play out like a mildly competitive game which, personally speaking, increases the motivation & ""drive"" to walk just those extra few steps. I love it."
Love the app. However I'd like to recommend and option to add calories needed/burned for breastfeeding! Breastfeeding women need to take on more calories and also burn more while nursing. It'd be great to be able to more accurately track how much I need to take in and burn off to reach the weight and strength I desire!
It was very helpful at first. I got really interested in recording my hours of sleep everyday.. so is the number of steps I had done. And then it wont update anymore. I tried to uninstall and reinstall but still jot working. Too bad!
I wrote a review and it's gone why? All I said is it wouldn't be so bad to be able to have the option for cleaning the floor as a workout i mean it's a chore that is tiring like working out and that a trampoline option should be added as well for workouts!
"Update 5/3 - Samsung, trying reading before responding. Sad. - Loved this app until today. I don't want to activate two set authentication just to see my steps or heart rate. Also you do not need permission to make and receive calls. I advise people to stay away from this app until they roll it back to what it was. -- update response -- Samsung you don't get it, I do not want 2FA PERIOD!!! YOU ALSO DO NOT NEED MY CONTACTS AND PHONE CALLS - IT'S A HEALTH APP YOU DO NOT NEED THOSE PERMISSIONS!!!"
This app used to be quite good but since the update I can no longer see average steps for the current week which used to spur me on to do more. Also I've noticed that there are gaps in recording of sleep. Surely we should be able to choose custom layouts for things like steps on the watch as users have differing needs
"Samsung Health rating dropped to 3.7 from 4.5 a year ago (3.6 on Jun 9). Looks like not many people going to enjoy your optimization. From a great app from years ago, tracking oxygenation, weight maintenance and activities to an app asking access to calls and history? I don't care if you plan use that call information or not, giving you an access makes it an option for Samsung. After Samsung Health disrespecting its users for years do I trust that you will not misuse the information? BIG FAT NO!"
Unable to open since update to phone. This is frustrating as I've only just bought a new watch. It was all working well until the update to the system happened so I cannot monitor anything at the moment.
"Two stars for persistent notifications, and requiring phone access."
The food tracker is now impossible to use. Can't add food and finding food is not consistent. App now appears clunky. Things that were a simple button click now are buried deep. Simple was better...
Would be great if you could add HIIT stationary bike to the exercises menu.
"I really enjoyed this app and have used it to track my fitness, but ever since the most recent Android update a few days ago, it won't stay synced and I keep getting notices that it is closing."
"I've been using this app for several years and have been very happy with it until the recent update. Unless I allow access to my phone for calls and access to my contacts I am NOT allowed to use the app. There is no reason the app needs access to make calls from my phone. Like others who have posted a review after this recent update, I will not change my permissions for the app to access my phone or contacts. I will be looking for another app. Your ""standard"" response is useless."
"I absolutely love this App!! I have lost 3 1/2 stone in 6 months. I have recommended it to numerous friends and family members, some of whom very upset because they have crappy Apple phones which are not compatable. Im now 4lbs off my goal weight and considering purchasing a comparable activity tracker. Give it a go, you wont be disappointed. Bye bye fad dietsüëã"
Horrible and pointless app. Doesn't sync to Samsung Watch 4 properly. No option to check for updates. Riddled with bugs. Samsung devices are garbage from my experience. Save your money.
"Latest update is horrible, forcing to give many permissions unnecessarily. Making a good app become bad for no reason Update: Because you decided to reply with a generic statement. Can you tell why the user should be forced to give 'Contacts' permission if he/she doesn't want to compete with other people on the contact list and just wants to sign up for global challenges? You didn't require this earlier, so why now? Look at the reviews and understand that people don't like the update. Fix it."
"Really disappointed with the last update, particularly the meal tracking. Having input options for only 3 meals and a snack doesn't allow flexibility for accurate tracking."
"excellent until the latest update. why exactly does this app now all of a sudden need access to my phone calls?? i feel Samsung has enough other possibilities to invade my privacy EDIT: then why not give me a choice if i need/want your ""better overall service experience""? i will switch to another app who will sell my data without my phone number and i will remember ""Samsung Health"" when the time comes to buy a new phone."
"Just updated it today and now it says ""For your security, Samsung Health can't be opened on a rooted phone."" Only problem is that my phone isn't rooted. UPDATE- Samsung App division contacted me and straightened out the problem. The Representative, Tim, was extremely helpful and friendly. Thank you Samsung for addressing this problem quickly with professionalism and kindness."
"I use this app pretty much as a step counter. Now you want to manage my calls and require me to give you my mobile number? Nope. And I'm sure you'll say you'll protect our data, but just search list of data breaches to see all the companies who failed there. So maybe don't ask for information you don't need and can't protect. I assume you'll reverse this soon given the replies, but I'll have something new by then."
"Your app is not working properly with galaxy S10 plus, the oxygen sensor is not accurate at all, I changed 3 phones with same results. When it's accurate on my s9 plus. I need to upgrade my phone but waiting till you fix this problem."
I used to love this app until this new update came out. I've been using it for years but now it's more complex to look at & I can't even see the macronutirents in grams until I go to the learn more button even then it's more difficult to read. Please bring back the previous samsung health & I would definitely have given it close to 5 stars!!!
I used to love this app and all the detailed information it gave me about my workout but now it says there's an error and it cannot be opened on a rooted device. I have not rooted my phone and see that this problem is showing up on different forums but so far I haven't found a good solution. Is this not something the developers can fix?!?!
The app doesnt automatically capture my steps for the day.i have to open it first even though autodetect is on. And it can stop counting at random times. This is why my goals are never reached because the app doesnt work properly now.
"Loved this App, I have a Samsung Fit and I can walk in confinement but it started bugging and not giving me the heart rate per hour, no more details on sleep efficiency and it is not syncing anything from the band. I really hope you can put it back to last week as it worked until Friday the 3rd of April. The fit plugin says that it does not support my phone anymore I have a Note 9 !!!! Please do something. I am in Mauritius so please don't make me call in USA, please Give proper support."
"I was hoping to use the app now that it doesn't require access to contacts, but it's asking permission to make phone calls. I don't want want it to make phone calls but it's a mandatory requirement, it will not let me use the app without giving it access to my phone. So I'm Uninstalling until this permission requirement is no longer mandatory"
Positives first. It's miles better than Google Fit. Now the negatives. I am using the app with a Galaxy Watch 4. There is no ability to use the blood pressure or ECG monitoring. Why isint this built into this app? I shouldn't need to buy a Samsung phone for this. The food tracking has no barcode scanner which seems like a big omission.
I had initially given this app a 5 star review but ever since this latest update that doesn't do a voice prompt of each kilometer stats I've had to review my rating of this app. It's tad stressful that I have to look at my watch once I'm close to the kilometer mark to get the stats and that's for a route I normally run. Kindly rectify this on the app version on Galaxy watch. Thanks
"After two step authentication update no access, goes into some continuous loop. What is the fix...uninstall??? Your response indicate more info needed but I did not see that. It asked for # verification & I ck'ed ok, then it goes right back to ""2 step authentication"" screen repeatedly"
"This app doesn't fully support Android devices while using Galaxy Watch 4. ECG and blood pressure require that you have a Samsung device aka phone You can use a hacked version of this app to get around this issue if you don't have a Samsung device; but why should we have to do that? Answer is, we shouldn't. I use a Microsoft Surface Duo 2."
"After purchase of my new Galaxy S21 Ultra, I discovered the Samsung Health heart monitor function I used on my previous Galaxy is no longer available. I had used this many times over previous years and it was part of my decision to stay with Samsung. Very disappointing!! Also permissions required for this app are totally ridiculous. Maybe my last Samsung phone? Should have better researched my purchase decision."
Great health tracker. I would give it a 5 star if it had support for Wear OS and able to add the fossil gen 4 Smartwatch as a compatible device for the app. This app has all the exercises I need for the gym and sports.
"I love this app, I just wish you could manually put in steps or km. I don't have a Samsung watch to update automatically, and it's not safe to take my phone with when going walking or running. Please will you look into this. Like the food and water intake you process manually, please add an option to add steps manually"
"The latest update has made it so I cannot connect my ""my fitness Pal"" app to the Samsung health app making my calorie intake and calories burnt inaccurate. I have tried uninstalling the app and reinstalling it however this has only made it so when I enter my email and password it takes me to a loading screen and it stays on that screen until I close the application if there is any way I can fix this please let me know Thanks"
"I have been using this app for years, and was really happy with it until this new update. I will not grant access to my Contacts and Phone Calls so the Samsung Health app can authenticate me. Samsung, if you want to get users back, find another way to authenticate that does not require access to unrelated data on our phones."
Why have you deleted SpO2 measure... this was my main interest...ü§¨.... I have followed your instructions but can find no separate specific (O2) tracker. After some further searching I discovered that SpO2 is now a sub- component of the 'Stress' tracker. This means all my historical records of SpO2 are no longer accessible. This seems a stupid and unnecessary change. Needless to say... a total PIA
"I really love this app. However, when it comes to the new features you added like the global challenges, I would like to suggest that if possible make the goal target on how much a person run or walk "" Distance"" like ""Starva"" developer can make the app's algorithm calculate distance and not on how many steps have the end user done since the motion senser can be manipulated if a user shakes the phone multiple time ""I tried this with my S7 edge"". All in all, if this adjusted, it will motivate the users and make the competition fair and square, otherwise users will be disappointed just like what happened recently when i was reading the community stories where some participants finish 200000 steps within one day. Thank you for your understanding, Don."
"Way way too many ads when there should be none ( like all Samsung apps). Also, I get very inappropriate messages from random people as ""challenges"" with no way to block them. Do a better job Samsung. In response to the ""there are no ads""...there is a built in banner at the top that displays advertisements and a tab in the pull down menue that says ""promotions"" that lights up when Samsung wants me to buy something. These are called ads. Fyi"
"A constant frustration. When I try to contact them or look into the problem using the FAQ or contact us, it sends me to search results on the internet. Completely useless. The data keeps getting corrupt."
"Accidentally deleted an entire list of exercise options, when trying to manually add exercise, it could do with clearer user instructions."
"The app is disgusting after update, security check after login with numbers and putting OTP many a times it dose not work. The app is awesome before update. But after that it will be not login. This is so worst experience faces by samsung user. We wouldn't expect from you."
"The only reason I had to use this app was for the Sp02 reading. You removed the SP02 capability, and now the app is essentially worthless. Unless you tell me WHY you removed this part, don't bother responding with your dumb corpspeak answer. Since my first review, Samsung is back to gaming us. Now, of course, I can't get passed the granting of intrusive permissions. Note Samsung's dismissive responses. Arrogance."
"Was really happy with this app until the most recent update, which took away the coffee counter. It was really helpful to keep an eye on my caffeine intake. With the amount of coffee I drink throughout the day, it's not feasible for me to stuff it into the food section. The counter was the main reason I started using the app in the first place. Why remove perfectly working features?"
Im very happy with this app. My one recommendation withIn the food tracker is to allow more portion size options. I weigh my meat in oz and I use a measuring cup for my veggies but it doesn't have those options.
"I used to love this app, but now it requires permission to access my contacts and phone number, no thanks. I have no interest in sharing or connecting with other people. I only used this app to track my steps. I Uninstalled it and refuse to use it until Samsung gets rid of this. The app was great, why fix it when it wasn't broke?"
"I bought the Galaxy active watch 3, I am very impressed and excited. Then I just got a sw update to measure ECG, when try to use it. I couldn't not. Later I see a note on samsung site that ecg can only be used with Samsung phone. I don't have a Samsung phone. Now I can not use this ECG feature. I may return the watch"
In app on phone can only type in blood pressure does not actually record using attached samsung galaxy 4 watch you have to manually enter. BP doesn't appear on watch. I know this was a region issue but thought I read somewhere that this was fixed for US phones.
Hello! I like the app overall but I hope there will be a fasting window feature. Thanks
"This app is very helpful for tracking food, exercise, and health data. It used to be able to use sensors to track heart rate, stress, Ox but that seems to have been removed. Not sure I will use it as much now that those are gone. Why did Samsung remove these features?"
"Good app, but allows users to cheat in Global Challenges. Nobody can complete 200,000 steps overnight and continue at this pace for the rest of the challenge. And it's always the same users. They must be feeding fake step counts via API. I submitted over 5 million steps for one second period without any issues. Should be an easy fix."
"Ni, you are not working against cheaters. I have been using this app for years, and there is always ppl with 2 steps per second for the entire month. Those ppl do not sleep or eat or whatever, they just walk. So where is your anti-cheat algorhythm? It is pretty simple, those numbers are unreal."
"I loved this app, but since the last update it has not worked. I have called the number that the responder keep telling everyone to call. it is no help, they sent me to the instore sight. they could not help because it's a developer issue. they have to issue a new update to the app. we are just waiting."
I've loved this app for a few years now. Would have given 5 stars then. But recently I have been using the food part more often. I LOVED that I could add all my ingredients in for a meal and it would calculate everything. Went to do that tonight and that option is gone. I hope it come back soon.
"Have been using this app for a few years now and its a fun way to track your fitness and measure and monitor your health, my favorite was the blood pressure measuring tool when I had my old note 9 (Note 10 not capable üò°), but I also really enjoy the global challenge."
"5/25/20 Update: I called to get help for this, and the problem was resolved. Everything is operating as it should for almost a month now. Lately this app continually shuts down for no reason that I can see. It usually happens if I am trying to get the details on a recent activity. Very disappointing"
Samsung update no good if I could give -5 I would. Why the F... take of the weight management part off the lifestyle app. It now does allow to see if your over or under on your calorie intake and how many calories you need a day. This the only reason this app is really good. You can enter food data from another app it will sync with S health and give you how many calories you have left etc. Tracking the walk running is great but calorie intake is really important for a healthy lifestyle
"I have absolutely no need or desire for this app on my phone. It, like Google Services users more space then apps I actually need. I was able to force stop but it doesn't really reduce the space. Why can I not delete such a useless app since I pay for my phone and pay to use it I should be able to choose what I want to take off. Any ideas how to get rid of it outside of going to apple?"
"Dear Samsung health team, this app is really Awesome. Bcoz of monthly challenges, I'am doing this to keep myself motivated. It is more likely to increase my physical and mental activity, lose weight, lower my blood pressure and overall health. But there are cheaters in this challenge. So, you should kick them out of this challenge..."
"The option to add functional training, HIIT and bodyweight not in the list, but it is the most common type of training people do now. I am the coach at F45 functional training and it would be useful to add it and sync it with my Galaxy Watch."
Also used this app daily. Just upgraded to the 22. It no longer works. Very disappointing. Not a cache issue. The app opens. Cannot take readings for pulse or stress. The buttons are GONE.
"I have RA, migraines and a bad right knee. I must use a cane. There are bad days and good days. Sometimes I can walk, sometimes not so much. Some days I can eat, someday I throw up all day. There is no way to log this information. I also wish competitions were divided into a section where seniors only compete (with canes, braces or other devices) so it was more fair. Oh, joy. Some young kid wins every months that has no health impediments. That does NOTHING for me. I get depressed."
"Earlier versions worked better. Now no exercise has a map, sleep data doesn't import, weight data doesn't sync. Looks like all the best functions stop working one at a time."
"No longer gives remaining distance. Only distance walked and duration. Other stuff I don't want eg elevation, pace etc. I want to know what distance is left to walk. Ive been using this for 5 years and was happy with it. Why change it? Very annoying."
"Hello, can you please bring back the weight management part? The one where you can compare calories burned and calories gained? The one with the arrow telling you if you have burned enough or need to burn more? If you'd return this feature it'd be awesome! :)"
We started using this when we train the huskies for bike jor mainly for the distance and course info. Sometimes takes a bit of time when in the forests to lock on to GPS and requires multiple key presses difficult when they are already running but overall quite like this does the same as the paid for muster apps do.
"Why is the vitamin A measurement, in ""My Food"" suddenly inaccurate? I cannot get it to measure correctly. UPDATE 7/29/2019: I have now deleted another star because now, there are more nutrients that are being incorrectly measured, ie. calcium, iron, and still vitamin A. It looks as though they are not reading as percentages anymore. PLEASE fix this issue to improve my rating and make me want to keep the app.. UPDATE: Now, as of 8/30/2019, you have totally screwed it up. Add ""won't sync"" to list"
"Update is a step back, no longer able to track calories burnt over 7 days as this average is not kept by the app anymore. I an frustrated by the weight not being able to be tracked so easily now either. You've made the app a lot less user friendly."
It doesn't count all steps made and the sleep measure is less than accurate . It says I've just woken and have had continuous sleep for 7hrs 26mins when I've been awake for over an hour and woke twice in the night and even got up one of those times . Not the first time it's happened either and I've only used it for a couple of weeks
"Since the new system update, I can't use the any of the features utilizing the sensor. The light doesn't even come on anymore and doesn't register my finger. Never had an issue prior to the recent update."
"The app DRASTICALLY undercounts calories burned at rest, like it's never heard of BMR. Also the app layout feels very archaic, like it was made by a teenager for a school project. Compare it to other leading health apps and you will quickly see a huge difference."
It was a great app until the latest update. Why would you do away with the weight management tool. It is probably the single most useful item for someone trying to lose weight. Disappointed.....
"Awesome, what a wow! App. To have all these functions on just one phone is like having your nurse with you all the time. It is really beautiful to check your water, stress level, sleep etc. I love my phone. I love Samsung."
"How can I get the old version? I hate the new one as it removed automatic steps counting. That's mostly what I wanted from it. Even if I set ""start walking"" doesn't work properly. Horror! I loved the previous one!"
"I loved this app and used it daily until the new update which required me to allow Samsung access to my contacts. I do not use this app for challenges with others and if I wanted to, I would choose who I wanted. Samsung assures us that they are not using or selling our information, but after a semester in my International Business class, there is not enough protection in our data privacy laws for this to be just for the optimization of the app. It is unfortunate the app will be uninstalled."
"It's been simple and easy to use as a tool to help me track my eating,drinking,excercise ,sleep and menstruation. All helps to keep me healthy. During lockdown 1,2,3 I has given me a focus to help towards a healthy mind."
Unable to remove inaccurate sleep time. My galaxy watch 4 always thinks im asleep when im watching TV
"This app was good in the past with everything at one place. Your heart rate, oxygen monitor, stress levels. I have used those things for rears and now with this s20 I no longer have access to stuff that made this app better then others. Now it an another useless app. Why we pay hundreds of dollars when samsung can't even provide the basis functionality."
Using galaxy watch active with Pixel 3. No option in app to separate steps counted by my phone vs steps counted by my watch. it's either the phone or everything. Also cannot edit out miles of activity when it is obviously incorrect.
8/8/2020 I loved the app until the latest update. The Weight Control and Caffeine Tracker were the items I used it for. Please bring it back!! 10/11/2020 Edited to add that the update that installed today is worse than before! Bring back the weight management features. Thats why many of us bought the watch!
"Suddenly started displaying a notice that my phone is rooted, it's not. Applied the latest update and the notice changed to 'an unauthorized change was made to my phone' and continued every 10 seconds until I uninstalled the app."
Loved old version. When I updated- it now no longer measures heart rate or stress level - pulse and oxygen levels. So i unenstalled and reinstalled it to try fixing - Nope! So basically all it is now is a glorified pedometer. Very disapointed
"I walked 6 miles and it only recorded 15 steps, what a waste of time. Having to download an independent App to measure my steps. ü§îUpdate (May 2020) Still having problems with the App recognising the number of steps I am doing ,I walked a mile and the App only gave me 11 steps ,did the same mile with a third party App it gave me 2568 steps. I have come the conclusion that Samsung Health App is no good ,it tell me how many calories I have lost but no steps to back it up .Will be uninstalling this"
"I was going to try samsung health, until I saw the permissions it asks for. It wants permission to make phone calls. This is a fitness tracker for counting steps. That's a ridiculous permission to grant a step tracker. Until it stops demanding so many unrelated permissions no one should install this app. The responses from samsung below to other people raising this issue are pathetic. Thanks for the same genereric answer you give everyone else. ""Optimal experience"" is a terrible reason."
"This app used to work great, and I always used it to track my runs, but now the gps tracker isn't working, and adding distance that I didn't run, which causes the average pace to be way off. If this isn't fixed, I'm going to find a new app with gps."
Shows updating then when clicked it says Unauthorized Changes were made and contact support. This app was good and I will not spend 30 minutes or being told how to fix your ITs Update. I did said I will not spend time talking to IT and yet You people have given me a number to call! Lol Fail fix your own problems I'll use some apps that is much easier to use
"can't open on a rooted phone error. no resolution. and to think I was about to buy a Samsung watch. oh well, one customer lost. tried uninstalling and reinstalling, restarting, app.settings.forcequit to no avail. nice work samsung... not."
Samsung health dropped the features that actually made the app great. Nothing about this app is good anymore. They dropped the Weight and Calorie management which when combined with activity tracking etc. was an absolute gem. Now that it's dropped I'm just uninstalling the app. Does nothing other apps don't offer better.
"The apps seems nice. For the food/ calorie tracker part, it would be better if it had a barcode scanner to make it more simple to input all information faster."
I love this app and how it has everything in one app but the food tracking could be better. I currently switched to lifsum for food tracking just do to the fact it has a barcode scanner thay does the work for me. would love to see that implimented in this app.
"What happened to the oxygen saturation testing function?? That function of the app was very useful for me. Now it has disappeared. I uninstall updates to get it back but even tho I seem to have auto updates off, the app still updates and O2 Saturation function disappears AGAIN. Please fix."
"It's actually a good app for personal tracking but really the competition part is b.s.!!! Come on 149,000 steps in a day is over 50 miles you can not tell me that is happening at the level of consistency that the app shows some of these people who are always on top of leader board have."
"I spent $1,200 on a premium phone and the native apps are bloated with Ads and there's no way to shut them off. Shame on you Samsung! Please give us the ability to hide the ""Recommended for You"" spam section. Also, the Samsung Partners garbage at the top needs to go too. Either the Ads go or I do! This is Ridiculous!!!"
"Some sort of graph or visualization for VO2, speed, heart rate etc over a span of week or month to track improvement would be a nice feature. Please add something like that so I can track how these parameters improve over time as I exercise"
"Latest update on Sep 28, 2020 just keeps stopping. And it doesn't sync with myfitnesspal at all. Please fix it asap. Update: the app is useless now. Till the issues are fixed, uninstalling and reverting to factory version."
The global challenge often will not open correctly. I want to participate but often cant get in to see my progress. I also miss seeing the health articles that were available in the old version.
"I can't get to measure my STRESS LEVEL. How do I get my stress measurement I have used this app for more than ten years. The most important attraction is the ability to measure my stress level and heart ‚ù§rate. Now I can't get these measurements. Besides some of the other features are not accurate. Could you please restore these important features, STRESS LEVEL AND HEART RATE ‚ù§ MEASUREMENTS. OTHERWISE, I'LL UNINSTALL THE APP. This app is what I find attractive in SAMSUNG PHONES."
Why does only heart rate data can be exported? Data for other weight and other data should be exportable as well. Edit: There seems to be a lot of cheating going on in the Global Challenges. It should be fixed.
"Love doing the step challenges with my husband! Had helpped me increase my step count each week, once I hit my targeted step count each day for a week Increase it for the next week. And like that it counts sleep. And picks up work out automatically and that the watch is water proof. I dont really use the water or caffine tracker. And dont really understand the active time feature. Wish i could figure out how to check my stress level and oxygen."
"It would be great if it had an ""other"" option and let us create/name our own workout. I do Beachbody and would like to enter the name of the workouts I do. I will give it 5 stars if I see that feature added."
my steps don't always track... I have to turn my phone off and on everyday. note 8 smh.. my iPhone tracks way better and the gear s3 is not any better. Samsung said I could send my phone in but no I'm not. You should have just replaced it with a new one. Now I'm iffy if I should get the Note 10 and the new watch Lords will. I'm thinking bout staying with the iPhone & apple watch.... they track way better.
"Great until it recently started forcing me to allow access to phone calls and requiring 2-factor authentication just to OPEN THE APP AT ALL. Not to mention all the giant, obnoxious ads for other Samsung products on the home screen. Uninstalled."
I regret ever buying a Samsung Galaxy Watch Active 2 because Samsung falsely advertised that this watch would have ECG/blood pressure capabilities. What they still fail to put anywhere in their advertising is that these features only work if you also have a Samsung phone paired to the watch. Sleep tracking is horrible and there is no way to edit the sleep time in the app like I could do with my old Fitbit. Battery life is dismal. This is definitely my last Samsung purchase.
"What happen to ALL the features..like the water count, Weight management, caffeine intake and etc...this update doesnt include none of its Original features..WHY....please bring them back...or i would have to delete this app because it would no longer be a benefit or useful.."
"The weight management feature was one of the ones i used most to track my calorie intake & output. Please bring it back in the next update, and the exercise history is no longer functional if you want to log a workout usjng ""Other Workout"". Hate the updates."
"I liked it, but updated version doesn't let me log in, just sits there are some forever. Apparently the only fix is to download the old apk that still allows you to skip login and login after every loads, but that seems unnecessary. Using pixel 5"
It is rather frustrating to purchase a watch/device for its known features only to find out you have to own the same company's other expensive devices just to use those features. To use the ECG feature their website says you must own a Samsung phone as well! I just spent a pile of money this year on a new non-Samsung phone and an Active 2 watch.. and two of the most useful features are unusable because said company can't manage to permit & code their US-version of their apps to support them.
Been using this up for a while and didn't had much problems with it. Is a good tool to register my activities.  BUt recently i come across something that can not solve ... Why does not a exercise record from Orienteering generates a gpx file?  I can only see a gpx when using the exercise running mode ...  Is there a fix for this or a option to enable this ?
"My husband's Note 8 has the features that you removed from your latest iteration. It is close to useless now, is this a feature? why not fix it so people can use it . In the meantime I will uninstall this useless application."
"Great app, but it use a lot of my battery storage. My phone would spend 3 hours to get the battery full again after is it empty in 4 or less hours. It would even eat up all battery while my phone is not in use. My phone got back to normal after I deleted this app."
"I used this app all the time, it helped me lose 20lbs after having my son. Now that the weight management function has been removed I don't really have any use for it anymore. All that data is gone and its super disappointing. :/"
"Poor as features suddenly disappear and may or not be found again by a fairly inexperienced user. Also weekly summaries do not show all the data shown on individual days. If not improved, not only am I going to delete the Samsung Health app but get rof this android phone and buy an IPhone."
"SUCKS!!!! Doesn't pause when I stop running so it completely messes up my pace, distance, time... I hate it. It's also so annoying to hear your update every mile. There should be an option to silence that."
"Not very good for tracking sleep. After the ""update"" (10/13/21), I am unable to input and save info/data. Seems that the app is getting worse instead of any improvements."
"After update the apps, it can't sync the steps in healthy 365 apps. Even after clear cache and force stop, then restart the phone. Wonder itz not supporting the apps already. Now the national steps challenge season 4 started. How ?"
It's a great app but I didn't give it 5 stars because it's only compatible with Samsung watches. Obviously they are trying to force you to buy their products. Otherwise I like the together feature and that you can include your friends and family. It's a good motivation.
"Since the latest update, I can't get past setting up 2 step authentication. It send me the code, which I type in, but the verify button isn't working. Really annoying that I can't use this app now!"
"Update makes app unusable. I HAVE to share contacts to access the app! NO. app disabled. used to be great for tracking stats like steps, heart rate, blood pressure, and caffeine, water, and calorie intake, and more"
"I can't sign in. It keeps coming up with this message when I click on sign in ""Samung account already exists in account manager"" I've uninstalled and reinstalled and no change. It happened after I changed my email address and then tried to connect it with cronometre"
Liked it ok but not using it now that they eliminated the use of the sensor for measuring stress/HR. It also was pretty pitiful that it won't let you manually enter workout times since you can't always have your phone on you when you exercise
I really love this app and that it auto syncs with some of my other health apps. BUT I would love for there to be a symptom/health tracker. I suffer from frequent migraines and currently have to log those on another health app. It'd be nice to have an all in 1 for those of us with chronic illnesses.
"Like it. But it doesn't record broken sleep or exercise other than walking/running. For example, carrying laundry up and down stairs, vacuuming/sweeping or any other physical activity. But otherwise very good."
"I dont know why you can't connect to friends via Facebook like the fit bit. I left fit bit for samsung n I miss the competitions n activities between my friends. The watch itself used to work and was ok for getting notifications n so on (new update has seriously effed up my watch) but this samsung health app needs A LOT more work, activities, health challenges and social chats etc. AND so friends can connect through Facebook or some social media??"
"Great but needs more integrations, such as myfitnesspal, or at least have the barcode scanner function to add calories. Also should integrate with scales, like weightgurus WiFi scale. Its great with my Galaxy watch though."
Amazing app. It worked on my galaxy s6 but I cannot synchronise it with galaxy s9+.This is really disappointing as I am losing all my previous tracks for no reason. Can you fix the problem please?
I love it! So many functions and motivation in one single app! The only thing I don't appreciate is that my Samsung buds are not connecting with Samsung Health as a wearable device and are not detecting excersice nor walking.. Other than that keep the great work!
why doesn't the watch app mirror the phone app for exercises? kayaking and cross country skiing are distance based sports. why doesn't the watch use GPS to track distance for these exercises like the phone app? also the GPS needs to update more accurately when doing distance based activities. my brand new galaxy watch 5 pro is useless for these activities. extremely disappointed. c'mon Samsung and Google you can do better!!!
"Ok so im really happy that you can now manually add food yourself with the nutritional values as well for more accurate teacking. I sent y'all this suggestion to y'all a while back (im sure many other have as well) and im just glad that y'all listened and this is a thing now. Love this app helps me so much in my efforts to track food, steps, and help me lose weight."
App stopped working. Took 2 weeks but the new update fixed it. Thank you. The new interface is fine for how I use the app. I'm so glad my watch retained the 2 weeks of data when I couldn't log in so I'm a happy customer once again. Thank you.
I love the app. I've tried many others but always come back to this one. To the people giving low ratings you do know its a free app. right? The only problem I've had is the Heart Rate tracker doesn't work on this phone. It doesn't give me the option to put my finger on the sensor. Other than that I love the app..
"Pathetic . Shows steps count, time count and calories count even when travelling on a van ,bike or train etc"
The GPS with this app doesn't track accurately. It loses .05 mile on each mile so at each 5 miles run it's .25 miles off. It would also be nice to have a translate option added as this app is used around the world...
"I like the app but would like it better if I could sync my fitbit app with it. I have read instructions, but still can't connect it. Needs to be more user friendly."
"I really enjoyed having this app at first, especially having my step count recorded. However, it stopped working and won't record my steps on my new Samsung A50 soon after I got it and hasn't worked properly since. Any advice on how to fix this would be greatly appreciated"
A severe bug!! i can not get into the app anymore. States can not open on a root phone. And it pops up at any time. please fix... seriously thinking about uninstalling it. update..did what you stated...still the same problem!!! i am uninstalling the app.
"I have a dozen samsung products, but each software update is worse and worse. A step tracking app should not need access to my phone and contacts; the ""contact us"" excuse just means you built it poorly. Please stop selling your customers data after we already purchased your products! (And as for the response, my 'optimal user experience' includes being able to opt of out of features that use security permissions I don't wish to grant.)"
"Last version before the update was 5 stars, but this new update really killed it for me. It's far to simple and doesn't show you the info you really need to know, macros and such, unless you dig. Hoping that they can rollback and bring back some of those features. Not sure why they would even dumb it down and got rid of them."
I can't see an option to measure my stress and heart rate. There literally like nothing. But same version in my friend's phone note 9 is having it. I don't know if it is because My phone is connected to my galaxy watch.
The app was fine but the people designing it know nothing about health. It does not show my carbs or fats in grams anywhere now. I have do extra work to figure out my protein when before it was on the main screen for the food tab. Now I have to use a different app to count my macros. Extremly disappointing.
"Really Pissed off, My Watch does not Synch for my Workout status on the app. Tried everything, uninstalling the app, updating my watch, deleting all previous content....almost everything has been tried, but still workout status does not get updated on mobile."
I'm really upset I just started back on my health journey and I ran more today than I ever have and it didn't record nearly any of it. I updated the device within the last two days and now its not working properly. Please please work out the bugs and give us a good update!!
"* UPDATE* SAMSUNGS REPLY TO THIS REVIEW WAS TO POST A CONTACT TO SAMSUNG KIDS WHICH IS A COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME AS ITS THE WRONG DEPT. The weight goal section has been removed. This allowed me to adjust my daily calorie intake based on my daily activity level. This was the key to the whole program, this program is now completely useless. Another great decision Samsung.... this stupidity just cost you a Note20/watch bundle purchase, thank god you did this before the new phone was available."
Have been using for years however updates to food tracking no good for those who eat more than 4 meals a day like myself. Need ability to add as many meals as you want and the ability to scan bar codes of food items.
Login food isn't as great to help and do not add up to package label. Also can you make it to wear you can scan your food labels to make more convenient? Its very hard to track my actual intake of calories when having to search type. Not to mention most grocery stores are not available.
Everything was so perfect in the old version . My problem with the new version is that you can't set your goals for example you can't set your default bed time or the max amount of food you want to eat
App crashed after 2 days. Wouldn't count my steps and was logging my sleep automatically even if I wasn't asleep. It wouldn't allow me to rate my sleep or change the times it decided I was asleep. If it can't do what I need then it's useless to me.
the app itself is great. could use more features but love the tracking capabilities. my only complaint is the amount of cheaters. I dont necessarily care who is first or second but it's odd seeing the leader with 10 million steps.
it's amazing ! Great app for tracking health But I dont like the slide mechanism where you have to swipe to the right to access extra features it's sometimes non responsive if you could fix this I would give a 5 star
"Opened it once, and got notifications for the rest of the day. I turned off notifications from the app each time, and still got 6-10 notifications. You're not above the rules I set for my device, Samsung."
"This app was a 5 until the boneheads at Samsung thought it was a great idea to nerf the spo2 function. I have severe lung problems and to simply look on my phone was great. Unreal! No, I'm not calling some number so don't bother with that kind of an answer. Just fix it."
Edited: Figured out my issue with editing and deleting manually added food items but the percentage issue for micronutrients remains. 16% of 18mg of iron is still somehow 16mg. This is kinda important to me as a woman so if the issue with the mirconutrients could be fixed that would be great.
Tried using the app today after not using it for a while. Suddenly they want me to set up two step-verification. I tried setting it up but after I submit my code I get thrown back to the setup page. Uninstalled...this is way to complicated for a health app!
Recent update broken. Says phone is rooted and it's not. Installed a root and safetynet checker to see if the phone was indeed rooted and all checks came back fine and safetynet hasn't been triggered on this phone. Works fine on my partners phone and that is rooted. Please fix.
It don't cover sleep in different patches in a day. If this can be improved. otherwise it's very good as it's usage helps to complete the daily targets thereby creating self motivation.
Good apps to monitor your daily health performance. Some items require daily update so you must have good discipline on updating your progress daily while some could be done via Bluetooth connectivity to health gadget ie smart watch and weigh scale etc I'm using Note 10+ I can't enjoy the stress information and heart rate using my HP any more. What a sad story. I have to forgo stress data forever üò≠üò≠
"I was happy with the app till the latest update which os meaningless!! Weight management was one of the features I liked about this app now its gone, very bad!!! Furthermore, with the latest update the app keeps ceashing all the time which I cant use anymore. Please put back the weight management and fix this bug otherwise this app is useless."
The step counter on this Samsung Health app does not work at all on my Samsung Edge Phone. I have followed every & all instructions that were given and i have even updated this app as well thinking that this would help but it still does not work. Very disappointed that i am unable to use this feature. Any suggestions?
"So I have also been using this app for sometime now, not just for fitness but also to track my periods. After this last undated I cannot access my information any longer. I feel extremely frustrated by this because I have a very unpredictable cycle.It WAS a useful tool and now its nothing..‚òπ‚òπ also dont need a fitness app ""making and managing"" ANY of my phone calls...thanks no thanks UPDATE: SAYING SORRY WITHOUT OFFERING A SOLUTION IS POINTLESS."
It was great when it worked. It hasnt been synching with myfitnesspal and other apps for weeks I've tried everything to fix it but it's not working. I use this as a replacement for Fitbit but it really sucks it isnt working
"really a great app I use it to track all my steps and miles I do a day and it has a plethora of other feature options that I find really useful, too many to name. It compiles data and if you are a very analytical person like myself then you will find this to be a very useful app."
"Horrible, on my CAT S60 I can only open 1 full screen so can not read the verification number in my e-mail, when I switch to the login the samsung-activation app reset itself. So I can not register. How stupid are the Samsung programmers? Huawei uses SMS-ver. code, which works perfect."
"Galaxy S22+ is now working again after a recent update. Still keeps logs of daily and nightly activity. Unfortunately due to the downtime, I've lost weeks worth of health data. Otherwise seems to be a reliable fitness tracker."
"I started using this app during the first lock down and managed to lose a lot of weight. The most useful feature was the weight management tool which was removed during an update. It was such a simple yet powerful way for me to ensure my calorie intake was under control. I just can't understand why it was removed, it just doesn't make any sense. I don't use the app anywhere near as much as I used to because of this. Add this feature back and I will gladly give the app 5 stars."
"I had stopped using this app for a while because I had forgotten about it, came back into using it and the sensor will show its reading but then says 'place finger on sensor'. My finger IS on the sensor, I'm not moving it, it has full contact. This is an annoyance."
"I like this app. Giving 1* as the app does not have option to add steps manually incase we did not use phone or any Samsung step tracker for the day. Also, the monthly challenge is of no use as I saw individual completing 173028 steps(100km+)on the 1st day of Feb 2020 challenge. Also, the app if can have tile view or all the summary of the day in a small section of the screen like the steps meter on the top in the app"
"Excellent, but you removed the weights in the macro section üòî it was very helpful for watching carb, protein and fat intake. Please fix this! EDIT: it's back now. The app is a 10/10 and the updated UI is great üëç"
"App is unusable. Does not let you log in. After you input your username and password, it just queues forever and never logs. I have tried, reinstalling, clearing cache, resetting, to no avail. Useless."
"worked brilliantly for about 12 months and then stopped counting my steps, so I've uninstalled it and installed it again, it started counting my steps again and again has stopped counting them, I'm not happy, I really love this app just can't understand why it's not working properly"
"Seems like a really good app for recording every person's activities, and tracking your steps. Great for someone who works out and is worried about health or even the most casual use."
"Using the app on a Samsung device is flawless, yet im currently using the Huawei Mate 20 Pro, and step count only works when the app is running. The step count usually run on the background for all health apps, and it used to work fine with my Samsung S6, S7 and S8."
"Compared to Fitbit's app, Samsung has some work to do. I used Health before I got my Fitbit a few years ago. I got a Gear Active 2 in March so I came back to Samsung Health. I wish it would link to My Fitness Pal to pull in the nutrition info (even if it is just the daily totals). My Fitness Pal is amazing for diet records, but Health is better for recording everything else. I'm glad to see that Samsung added the women's cycle, but I need more than 50 characters for notes!"
"The app is terrible when it comes to calculating calories burned. It does not dynamically calculate the number of calories you have burned based on actual physical activity (as detected by a Galaxy Watch) unless you are making steps or working out (for example, you could have an elevated heart rate after an anaerobic workout and the app would calculate calorie burned as if you were at rest...)"
"Was also enjoying the app, but since I updated S Health won't connect to my wearable device (losing step count). So frustrating. Something happens everytime I update. I've reset my watch, cut it and the phone off and back on and updated all that can be updated and nothing works. Read the internet....etc. What to do?"
"The steps count is horrible. Whenever you stop movement for a couple of minutes, it stop counting. If have to off the apps and ON it back everytime you start moving. Regret buying this apps."
"I use it to track my everyday walking schedule. But after an update it says ""paused"" . In an average it says so at least ten in 20 min walk and then there will 5 sec delay in resuming it. This issue rose only after certain update. Please resolve it's very irritating."
"So the app is good and bad. Good on the workout side. However on the food side, you can't add an item when it is not in the database. MyFitnessPal is a great app to update your app to."
"excellent app. but because i bought an s7 edge off of ebay, the previous owner rooted it or something and now even when i install it, it doesnt work. this app was a big motivation for me losing weight and its to bad that now i cant even use it. i just get an error saying it doesntnworknon rooted devices. it also doesnt want to update to android 8 but i guess samsung cant help me with that either. tldr, probably the best health app if your not me üò≠"
"After the latest update they require 2 steps authentication, but they fail to send the code via SMS. I cannot use the app anymore. Samsung, you are just awful. I now have a health monitor device from you that you made useless. DO NOT recommend."
"This is a great app, but I think there needs to be a way to scan bar codes on things you eat that pulls up the exact information for that item to better help keep track of things. Hopefully this a update that happens very soon, then would be a amazing app."
"Looks like a decent app, but not being able to add specific contacts manually / being forced to give access to my full contact list feels intrusive, considering the contacts i'm interested in adding are Samsung accounts, not phone contacts. The privacy policy is also a bit triggering @ acknowledging data is shared across borders where ""data protection may not be as strict"", especially if I'm to provide my name, dob, and it's stated you collect & store my address somehow? Am i misunderstanding?"
The update was just a massive disappointment. I now can't go into the app at all. It asked me to review the permissions and reset my password which I have done and nothing! It doesn't even allow me in. I now loose all my historic data.
"Keeps my goals in focus. I look at this app two to four times a day to monitor my steps. Easy to read, easy to share. It is a part of my overall health goals. Huge bonus, when I see the top 25% of over 1,000,000 challengers in my rear view!"
"Was a good app, now wants access to make and manage phone calls. No thanks. Won't work without giving it that permission. Edit after reply: seriously? You need access to my phone calls to make a fitness app work? Give us the option to opt out of that ""optimal experience"" please."
Doesn't sync my activities with Strava even though I have the apps connected. Starting to regret the decision to purchase a samsung gear fit 2. I would prefer not to go back to my old TomTom watch to track runs and bike rides.
"Exactly as the last 3 posted 04/14 from Mandy, Todd and Bob. Terrible, I can't get pass the permissions. Which I don't agree on all of them. Why do they want permission to access even my storage card? I just bought the watch yesterday; the app was working fine until I did the update yesterday. Today I'm considering returning the watch when it arrives on Monday."
"It sometimes lags and for some reason, after the counter resets, it counts my active time, mileage walked, but doesn't count my steps. I walked 32 minutes and 1.63 miles and it had only counted 400 steps in that time frame."
"The updates continue to remove the useful features. Each time they ""improve it"" they make it worse! 1. Weight control tracking 2. Total steps by week/month 3. Total miles by week/month"
Would have loved if the app has a barcode scanner to scan food items and their nutritional information. Also would have been great if exercise and mediation programs can be saved as favourite and starting their schedule dates and time can be customised!
"Please add bar code scan feature. Makes it so much easier to input data. Bar code reading isn't that difficult to implement. Also, please allow us to override the unit of measure for the meal item consumed."
Not as good as others but very disappointing that they are requiring so much to use the app and a two verification just for a fit track app these app are doing too much and collecting our information there is no reason for my phone number or additional information for me to track exercise. Pleas users be aware. I will uninstall App this was not required before this is being used to invade privacy. My ancestors didnt need all this to lose weight or be healthy neither do we. Enough is enough.
"Since my original review back in August, after you stupidly removed the weight management feature, I was forced to roll back my app to v6.10.0.041 so that I could still make use of it. This also meant I had to disable auto updates, meaning I have to manually update every other app to prevent Samsung Health updating. Please don't tell me to keep my app updated, just answer one question for ALL of us. Exactly when will you reinstall Weight Management?"
"The rotating ads at the top drive me crazy. Yes, they are ads. Don't answer this telling me to call. I did call and just because they ""are part of the app"" doesn't mean they are not ads. Very frustrating!"
"Initially, i was reluctant to use this app but when i used it with friends and family members by giving and accepting challenges, i always felt an urge to do more each passing day. Before, i was below average in my age group category but now i am always in Top 10%age. I am really enjoying this app and recommend it to my friends also."
"Worked great for a couple days, but now it crashes after 10 seconds or so. I can't even send the feedback through the option on my phone because that crashes after a second or two also"
"Ever since I have updated the app I am not able to open the app because of your stupid 2 factor authentication. I open the app, it asks me to setup 2FA, I enter my phone number, code received by sms is automatically read by the app correctly but once I press verify it will go back to 2FA start page. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app, it did not help. Same story for the code received by phone call. To Dev: I am not able to open the App, how am I supposed to go to Settings > contact us?"
"Really like the app. It gets me motivated & I'm finally losing weight. My only concern is, the steps may be accurate but the distance is way off. I reckon this is an easy fix."
"I always enjoy the app & love the features it has. However, after some time when I open the app, it always shows - ""Your number has changed or was verified on different device. You need to verify your phone number again to continue using Samsung Health"" I'm using same mobile number & only one device - Samsung galaxy S20 FE 5G. I don't understand why I've to verify mobile number almost every day when I open the app. Disappointed..!!"
"Bring back calorie management! The calorie management was instrumental in making sure that I maintained a healthy lifestyle. It helped me reach my fitness goals and the app seems worthless without it, please bring it back!!"
I can not believe how horrible samsung is. I surly am going to return to apple again. I could not contact samsung for once. I tried every thing. Damn it you made a lot of my activities useless because i couldn't record them. It is horrifying. Awful product and the support us even worse.
"Every 30 seconds notification sounds 'Samsung account session expired. Sign into Samsung account again.' So I sign in again and clear the notification, and it happens again immediately. Over...and over...and over...and over."
It works well but it could use some updates like to the food tracker like a bar code scanner and a recipe builder. Also to the monitoring app I have the Samsung watch and it does not automatically track my sleep cycle.
Ever since I downloaded this app my phone freezes constantly. When I remove it phone works great. Reinstall this app and it goes to $&%& again. Do better Samsung because I'm switching back to my old fitbit 8 yr old fitbit.
"The app helps me to focus on improving my health standard especially weight, regulating my diet and controlling my stress level. Honestly it is fantastic. I will not hesitate to recommend it to people who take their health seriously"
"Very unhappy with my latest update. The weight tracker previously had a great chart, showing the weekly and monthly trends. That is now gone! Very disappointed. V6.15.0.091"
"App does not sync with Galaxy Watch Active correctly for step count, only shows the steps under ""all steps"" does not gove an option for the Watch in the steps area. Please fix, this is messing with my health insurance as it requires an accurate step count."
"The app is good except for one thing - global challenges. The target of 200,000 steps is quite a challenge sometimes. According to me, global challenges should be customised according to all kinds of people. For example, 100,000 to 150,000 steps for people with health issues but want to walk everyday to keep themselves healthy and fit."
App is trash pauses during workouts non stop. No data it collects is actually real because it doesn't do its job and stops during workouts by the time you're done you realize the app has paused it self 15 times in the past hour totally ruining any data you should have.
Iam giving one star bcoz i dont know weather this application works only when we wear the watch or irrespective of wearing the watch. According to my use this application is working even we are not wearing the watch and the step count is showing ok if it works there is no issues but the count is not accurate even if iam not walking and placing my phn on table or desk also the step count is counting in ideal condition as well so i think this is not that useful or you need to resolve the issue.
"New update, new hickup!!! So, the daily limit for saturated fat is now 1300?????With every update things are going downhill! I use this app for daily nutritional balance for more than 2 years now. After the last update nutritional balance score and the recommended nutritional intake per nutrition for the day went down the drain as well! For me this app is useless now! Bring back those features! Used to love this app."
***Edited*** Sometimes it doesn't count steps and no matter what you do after a couple of days it'll fix but it's so annoying. Also I'm sure so many people would be glad if it was able to synce to Mi Band and etc.
"I expected more from Samsung. The sleep tracking ends when I open the app. NOT when I wake up. I could be up moving around for an hour or so then open the app which will show I woke up just then. Where can I see previous days? I am not a techmology novice. These sample images you show here , WHERE are they in the app?! This app is so basic. I switched from Fitbit for this? $300 watch, $ .50 app. Pitiful. Do better Samsung. Your customers expect it and you are capable of it. Please."
"Had been a 5* app. Today, after doing update, keeps saying can't open on rooted phone. Problem is, according to root checker apps, my phone isn't rooted. Any help would be appreciated. EDIT: The reboot and reinreinstall worked. Hopefully, you have this glitch fixed. Thank you."
"Ever since the last update (April 2022), the battery life has been ABYSMAL on my Galaxy Watch Active 2 (which has Samsung Health app and syncs its data with my phone's). I used to get 4 days of usage on the watch before needing to charge. Now the battery dies in 20 hours. While I slept, the battery dropped from 73% to 17% (about 7 hours). Checking 30 minutes later, the battery was down to 4%! Checking the watch's battery usage since the last charge shows Samsung Health is the problem consumer."
Love the Samsung health app to keep track of my activity levels in sync with my Samsung gear watch. The only thing I don't find so good is the calorie counter - it is not so easy to keep track of calories as the amounts aren't always in easy portion sizes so I have to guess
The two step Verification is not working. I've tried it sever times. It just won't take my verification code. I'm at a loss. I cannot access my account! Do better! Some please help.
"Simply; it's the best! Comprehensive and gives more than what you want, I can't give less than 5 stars, thanks Samsung!! Please keep developing and enable more features like adding the meals by reading the products bar code ... Moreover, you are taking each feedback in considerationüëçüèªKeep the good work up ‚ù§"
app will open but doesn't allow me to check Oxygen etc. it just opens and rgat is all it does.
I am having a trouble with this app's calorie burn for the day...its says i burn 16000+ cals a day...the app hasn't always done this...not sure what has happened but the samsung watch I have is doing the same thing. calorie burn is way way off....and the GPS works only some if the time. I did get a new phone a few weeks ago... an S10. that shouldn't be the problem.
It record's 4Km running and showing that I ran 4km then after few minutes later shows that 3.66km dont know how that works
I just started using the app but I really love the weight management feature. It's really helpful letting me know when I exceed the calories and offers suggestions how to burn them using my preferred excercises. So far so good!
"Why is it a required permission that I give you access to my contacts? BS, not happening."
Bring dark mode because my phone does not have inbuilt dark mode and it sooths the eye and reduce eye strain
"I love how easily it is too be able,too use this..I am handicapped an is helping me get my strength back.."
USELESS. Samsung Health (Steps) doesn't work unless phone (Galaxy s22u) is restarted daily
Hi I used to be able to read my pulse on s10 but that has disappeared on s22 version
"Brought a new Samsung A40 phone and transferred this app across from my previous A5, Step Counter does not work at all. Tried un installing and re installing still didnt work. Despite sending several messages to Samsung Health nothing they have asked me to try has worked. Stay away from this app its useless. I tried the above phone number, which is in the USA, and it was a complete waste of time and money. The guy who answered my call knew nothing about the problem at all."
"This app functions as an average in step counting.Even you are countinuing walking this app is paused. Signing is very difficult. Prerecorded voice messsges are not clear. When we change the handset, the saved data does not retrive in new device."
What happened to my sleep monitor? It used to read light/heavy/REM & its gone!
"Very good app, but still counting steps while traveling in a car."
Please enable for devices with tripped Knox. It's not always the user's fault.
Having an issue my period monitor isn't working I put the date in but it's not showing
"The app is not working at all due to Server issue, what kind of dev ops is running this, it s Down for days ü§¨"
There are issues with the app. It doesn't want to record my steps the majority of the time.
"I have a few questions for Samsung health app.  1. When we do the running in indoor itself how the algorithm works? And what basis calculating the KM's and calories.  2. I tried with same with upstairs in the house that takes a long time to for one KM's don't know on what basis the algorithm taken but the calories taken its huge bit confused   3. Another tried with a road run its taken the GPS taken I think. Is that any count for steeps if completed, then 1 km finished?"
Why do you need to have compulsory 2fa? Removing the pathetic app that need data. Why can't one start using it without 2fa.? I think this is phishing app that collects mobile number and sell it.
"Functions do not work properly.no sleep records, steps do not agree to watch"
Keep crashing every time open the app keep crashing while opening settings
Since the last update my stress meeter has stopped working and not moving on my watch face
Since the last update you can no longer check your weight or blood pressure Weekly or Monthly. It would also be nice to be able to download all of your data. The maximum you can download is 3 months. Having said that I think the app is better than the Google Health app.
"When I am sitting in the car, the daily activity is still going on. The solution is to stop whenever the speed is greater than 5"
Use it to count my steps. Works well for that but I'd rather go to youtube for workout vids.
"In newer phone models, the former access to many functions has been removed."
"Doesn't let me sign in or up, just has a loading circle and never loads."
"Pls add compatible to more devices like xiaomi band, mi body composition scale 2."
Hi I've just been walking with my dauter Her I phone and watch recorded 5 mile My samsung galaxy 22 and watch 4 Recorded 7 miles The 5 miles is correct What's going on
Update ruined it. Had to uninstall and then reinstall to get it to work (was getting an access denied message) and now all of the data/history is gone even though I'm logged in. Could use more sync options too like Google fit.
"Helps me keep up with my health, I love all the features and have no complaints"
"Pretty sweet. Really liking the pedometer. An improvement I'd suggest would be a home screen widget for starting workouts, or shortcut creation on the home screen. Maybe a workout tracker on the lock screen."
"stuck in the 2FA thing, wont send me my message code, and if i skip i get an error üò§"
"Been a good app, but latest update forces allowance of new phone access permission and enable 2FA. The new permission is unnecessary for 2FA though. MOST IMPORTANTLY: Actually enabling 2FA is bugged. I receive the text with the verification code and type it in to the field, but the ""verify"" button *does not become enabled* when I have typed in the code. There is NO workflow to move forward from that point. That feature is now *Required* to open or use the app, so I can't use the app AT ALL."
"Steps on phone no longer sync with galaxy watch steps, annoying!"
Yo! Fix your app! It's been around 9 months of your app/gps messing with my time on my runs!
"Not accurate at all I have only done 700 steps in a day even though on a other app I walked 20,000 steps doesn't pick up my steps"
Where did everything go? Upgraded from an S8 to S22. Can't check oxygen levels anymore...
Easy to use. Have lots of exercise options available.
Hi. I wish i could see my steps on my lock screen. Thanks a lot Samsung group for your profitable app.
I just got the app on my tablet because my phone died but it says it needs a sim card but I didn't have one in my phone and it worked
"Love samsung health, hate the sleep tracker update!! The sleep tracker used to have, awake, light, rem and deep sleep, now I have lost these and just have the old restless, light and motionless back. This has rendered the sleep tracking practically useless!! Not even remotely close to accurately tracking my sleep. Will happily make this a 5 star review if you sort the sleep tracker. Phone has updated and my sleep tracker is back, great health app!"
"Have always rated this app pretty highly...but lately it isn't recording steps accurately. Have been out for a 5k walk and it has counted only 95 steps!! This has happened a lot lately!!!! Will give one last try, if not I will definitely desinstall!!!"
"Update is rubbish, no amounts for breakdown for food on landing page need to go through another link. New and 'improved' widgets give me less information than before. Cannot see trends over days, weeks or months so endless scrolling. Switched from sony 4 months ago and now wish I hadn't! Let us choose whether to have the rubbish more generic 'improved' widgets or the detailed older version"
"hi , this app changed my life style , i track my workout and sleep and everything , tx , i have a question !? i have s22ultra and watch4classic , im a body builder , what exercise should i pick in my watch when start gym? i pick other workout , please help me , ty"
"I honestly dont know what to review for this app because everytime I go to use it, all is says is service unavailable please try again later, I still havent even set it up yet because of this. I have tried everything from deleting and downloading to restarting my phone if anyone has any solutions I would love to hear them."
"I don't accept the way the company treats me: I paid a full price for the phone, I paid a full price for the watches, why should I see annoying ads in Samsung applications, and can't disable it? UPD: Dear support, before answering script responses ensuring me that your app doesn't contain ads, please take a look a third line of the app header saying: ""Contains ads""! I am so disappointed that you treat your customer like it's a silly kid."
"Why does a health app need the permission to make and receive phone calls in order to function? I don't care if you don't sell the info or anything, why can't you let me use the app with reduced features? Most apps allow you to use them with no permissions allowed, then only when you try to use a feature that requires permissions does it ask. Now the app won't even let you get past the terms and conditions without giving access to your phone."
This app has been helping me to lose weight during the last 4 months and I loved it but due to the latest update and removal of the weight management section I can no longer keep track of my calorific intake. I am very disappointed that this section has been removed and hope that the developers of the app bring it back.
"Deleted app as I'm NOT prepared to accept new term. Now my review has disappeared? I got an email that I can't reply to trying to explain the need for a health app needing access to my calls, but obviously BS. there is something going on. Why cant I change my terms and conditions after I've signed up and agreed to something but these app people are doing it all the time."
I gave it 5 stars in earlier reviews. I sync my Samsung watch Sunday to Sunday. Earlier it used to provide weekly Summary on the same day of sync But now since a period of 6-7months this app has its own whims and fancies. It provides weekly summary only once or twice in a month. My other sync data is eaten by the app and digested more frequently and does not provide WEEKLY SUMMARY Pl rectify at the earliest
Can someone please tell me how to pause the step counter in the app? I just bought a galaxy 4 watch. Every article or video I read and watch say that there is a pause step option in the app but it is not located where they say it is. From what I can tell the app is counting even when I'm in my vehicle. Thanks for any help.
"Worthless app, I chose to skip the 2FA but the app still forced me to do it, but refuses to send an email to allow me to enable it. When an email eventually came and I tried to sign in it just doesn't work. Absolutely pathetic."
"Will not accurately track steps anymore so I am forced to use another app when running. And this app is known to have cheaters galore on it. In example: a new global challenged had just started and automatically someone had accumulated 200,000 steps in one day. This app is not policed enough. There should be a limit per day on how many steps humanly possible you can accumulate."
I have used the app for about two years...loved it. Had to reset my phone...lost all my data. Can't reinstall without permission given to modify my settings. That's a no-go. Will have to find another health app
"EDIT: YEP, TYPICAL CUT&PASTE RESPONSE. DOESN'T ADDRESS OUR CONCERNS. The app used to be somewhat useful for sleep tracking, until the latest update locked me out of the app and is forcing me to set up 2-factor auth, which it freezes when I try. As for the permissions that are required? Forget that! THERE IS NO REASON TO FORCE ME TO GIVE ACCESS TO MY CONTACTS OR MONITOR MY PHONE CALLS. Samsung, don't bother replying with your standard cut&paste response that doesn't address our privacy concerns."
"I was told in my last feedback that I could measure O2 in the stress area of the app. I am in the US - just to be clear. I have the brand new S20+. Measuring stress isn't even an option. I have to reiterate, in this time of a severe respiratory crisis, why is this not standard? Even if its not 100% accurate- it would be a guidepoint for people stuck at home."
"I like the Apps versatility and ease of use. Wish it was easier to track monthly goals, total distance, and add additional exercise sessions manually."
"Your app is utterly terrible, randomly logs me out and now I'm locked out forever, because as soon as I change my phone number this happens and IT NEEDS A VERIFICATION OF MY OLD PHONE NUMBER. A full year stats wasted... wish there was a 0* *update* I contacted the customer service and they did nothing, they did the same asking for verification from my old phone number."
"Instead of being able to see all my widgets at a glance with graphical representation, I have to scroll through a list where half the information is in very small text. I don't understand why you would want to make your app less convenient to use."
Not sure if the calories burned counter is accurate. And I don't always have a scale to measure by weight for the food tracker. But I really like this app if it wernt for the app I'd still be on the couch.
"In general the app is very good, however the version on my new Galaxy S20 won't let me check heart rate without using a Samsung watch or band. I'm pretty sure the previous version I have had, used the fingerprint sensor."
"Thanks a lot, you dumbasses. Your latest update cleared out almost 2 years of my data. Had to reset everything and it's like I've never taken a step. Do that again, and your dumb asses will be deleted. I just dropped your rating to 1 star and if I could give it negative stars I would. I have fought with this piece of junk for 3 days since the update and it has become useless. You will not get into my contacts. I'm disabling the app and putting a good one on. Goodbye, dumbasses."
Needs access to my phone and calls in newest update. No valid reason given. Uninstalling. Update‚Ä¶ Thanks for the quick reply Samsung. However why would I ever give access to use my phone to anyone I don‚Äôt know. Your assurances as to what you intend to use the permission for mean nothing. I suggest you remove the requirement to give you permission to use peoples phones. I used to use this app a lot but will now be uninstalling it.
"I am often measuring my heart rate because of a medical condition and i have always used this app, but it has recently not allowed me to even open the app and continues to say ""access denied"" and to contact us but when I click the contact button it just takes me back to the page in where it said ""access denied"" so now all of my data is unreachable."
"Meh. Not the best but not the worst I cabt utilize everything I want one here. The food doesn't have a barcode scanner, along with finding a digital scale that will hook up to the app Also"
It used to be a great app with feautures that are essential like measuring heart rate and oxygen levels. Now i got s20+ and i am shocked that it doesn't have all these great features supported anymore on my phone. Very dissatisfied customer.
Why 2 stars? 1. Tried this app 2 times trying to log in from my old account from my old phone and phone number. Yet even if I log in using my google account it still needs to be activated from my old phone number which I can't. 2. I try to make a new account yet it doesn't let me since I use the same email/google. 3. This app is really helpful aside from all the inconvenience and hardship that I have gone thru.
Liked the old samsung health. I could do heart rate and steps. Heart rate is essential to me because of tachycardia. I just finished walking 6 miles and no steps were coubted. Why to we have to keep updating aren't happy with your program. Im not. Dont like it at now. I'm thinking of getting a different brand of phone l'm done with Samsung.
"Getting used to the new interface. It's fine. But, WHY are they using a lemon as a food graphic that fills a you record your intake? And why it is sloshing? I have six ideas of the top of my head for a better graphic. It makes no sense."
"I just got a New Samsung Fit e, bit I cannot use the Samsung Health app as it shows the following message: ""This Service is temporarily unavailable. Try again later. (0x0700010)"". My phone is a Samsung A70, and as I read online there has been issues on the app for that phone model. I hope someone from Samsung can help, please!!!"
It was working excellent until the recent update the gsp signal seemes to be not accurate as it varies too much in speed and distance due app gps issues. Running programs are not able to use proper gps in step count it shows more distance and in running it shows less distance due to some gps issue
can't even rate the application right now as it just stopped counting my steps. thought it was an error and I restarted my phone and still it's been a couple of days and the app is not counting my steps. please assist in fixing this.
"Downgrading review from 5 to 2 star. This app used to have really good features. However, since quite sometime, features that made this app great have been removed. Basic features like continuous graphs for heart rate have been removed, this app is getting more and more useless by the day."
"No longer syncs with mapmyride. Downgraded my rating to 2 stars because of Samsung's canned and unhelpful response. Until you get some more human customer service reps, just fix the issue and be done with it, please UPDATE: uninstalling"
"Could be improved. Especially by reducing app size, and walking step detection. As other users have suggested, perhaps combining both old and new by displaying info as swipable cards might help? :)) Just a suggestion, cheers. üòÅ"
"I used to love this app, but now it no longer consistently synchronizes with my watch. My step numbers are horribly off :( Really disappointed. I May have to purchase a competitors fit tracker if this doesn't get rectified soon :/"
"Compared to me using Apple Watch, iPhone and the Apple Health, Samsung has a different approach which makes it way ahead than the apples. Here is why. To use the Samsung Health eco system, you just need a smartphone. Even an iPhone in your pocket can enable every feature of this advanced sports and health monitoring app whether you have a Samsung watch, fitness band. challenge friends and family for the steps you take, or compete for ranking and completion of monthly challenges and what not"
"I updated the app two days ago. Disaster struck. All of a sudden it glitches midrun. Wrong readings, intermittent announcements. One angry runner. Time for a new app. Previous version was bliss."
I do not like that sleep cant be adjusted when it doesn't record me waking up properly. I hate that it doesn't record sleep so that I can view on my smartwatch. They need to fix these issues.
I use this app daily as an excellent way of tracking my health and fitness progress. only 4 stars as of last update the nutritional values are always 0. I have to manually sync account for the values to show. if this fixed would be a 5 star app.
"Like others, I've used this app for years but won't now that it requires 2-step authentication (despite fact I'd only been storing data locally anyway) and access to phone calls. Bye - app uninstalled. Your standard cookie-cut response does not address issues."
"I got a heartbeat of 175! It asks me to move when walking or on train! Very inaccurate after new firmware! Tells I am asleep when behind PC. Where is 24 hour activity widget? Why would you remove an optional function? I want my detailed sleep record back to know what interrupted my sleep and what time. Why Samsung pay needs permission to access my contacts? Whatever the reason, please remove this permission This update is ridiculous. The notification can't be removed."
"Absolutely horrific, you start to use it and rely on it specifically the o2 saturation measurement and record and then with no choice or warning suddenly it's gone. I will now have to delete the stupid app and try find one that works. I have lost 6 months of careful measurements and find the total disregard for consumer opinion distressing. I will not be buying Samsung again."
"I wish that I could increase the stars, but they keep going down. Common Samsung, make this simple change that everyone is requesting!! FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, LET US EDIT MILEAGE ON TREADMILL RUNS AND STATIONARY BIKES! This has been requested for YEARS by users! I'd love to just be able to use Samsung Health and NOT jump between this and Strava!!!!!"
"Whoa! Listen to your Users guys. I used this app when it was quick & efficient. After several attempts to login, received Pin, even changed my password - but still unable to login üòê Who has time for this? Just UNINSTALLED it & looking for a more efficient app!"
"Hi.. using this app with Samsung smart watch. Since the new updates came, all have been screwed up. Map is not showing correct location. Weather location 50 km away showing. Went to service centre but they also couldn't able to help."
"I used to love this app, but since the update any workout I do pauses randomly and I lose tons of data. There is absolutely no option to turn off ""automatic pause"". Very frustrating"
Not sure how accurate this app is out there in the real world in comparison to other users? I purely use it as a measure against my previous data. Used the app for several years and generally like it and get on with it. It can lag a little when adding water or caffeine intake etc and I've frustratingly missed the odd star when the app mysteriously cannot read the data from my gear fit 2 or S3 tracker?? I'm used to its flaws now and accept its quirks... still using so it must be ok üòÜ
"The app is very good. Syncs with my galaxy watch well, however on the calories consumed widget on the watch it actually displays half of my calories consumed throughout my day when I log them in on the app. Kilojoules unit support would also be handy! Awesome app!"
"I used to love this app before the last update. Now, I need to download all my contacts into the app in order to use the monthly tracker challenge. Really Samsung? Fix that and I'll change my rating back to 5 stars. Update: Samsung, how many 1-star ratings do you have to receive before correcting your new requirement for downloading contacts into this app?"
"Would be 5 star but they removed the feature I used the most with the January 13th update: seeing the weight as daily, weekly or monthly data. No more possibility to see the weekly or monthly average data under weight, only daily."
"Last month I gave this app a 1 star, it use to be my fav pre-installed app and I used it all considering I have had seizures and cannot afford wearable. With the last update, 'poof' it was gone. I AM SO HAPPY EVERYTHING IS BACK!!!! Thank you for following through and reinstating this amazing tool for those of us with much older phones who can't afford the latest and greatest or fancy do-hickies. I have always stood behind Samsung and will continue do so. Thanks for squashing the bug. Lizzy!"
I have asked that the number of stair flights be included almost 2 years ago and it still is in the works. iPhone users get flights on their app as it counts steps. Iphones Counts flights just walking around. also would like to be able to see weight tracking graph for up to 5 years
"Really good app!! I like how this app records how many steps I am doing in a day, which encourages me to reach my goal every day and go out walking more. The app is really good for recording how much sleep I am getting at night and helps me to get into a better sleeping schedule for work. Would recommend!"
I love this app but I really wish it carb counted more efficiently. I care about my calories but I wish it was able to do the same with carbs. Everytime I look at my carb intake it is a percentage not an actual number. In order to get a number I have to manually add each of my daily meals.
"This app used to be an amazing, but once they removed GPX export feature I can't manage my running workouts now in external apps, so it became absolutely useless to me. Removing and looking for alternatives."
With the latest update the weight management feature is gone. Also my audio guide although ON stopped giving me an audio feedback which is very frustrating. Please get back the earlier features.
"On Aug 29, my app stopped syncing with Virgin Pluse, my steps stopped being transferred. I have checked permissions and they are set correctly. Not sure what is happening."
Unnecessarily complex to get it running. The app it replaced was simple & worked fine (until today). Am referring to pedometer here. Damn thing wouldnt start counting steps . Have uninstalled. These IT people are sometimes too clever by half... Will search for a competitor.
Your update for 2 step verification is not working. If you click not Now it crashes. If you try setup 2 step verification it doesn't continue after you have entered the verification code. It just stuck so I can't use the App until this is fixed
"Was perfect until the recent update. Now the app keeps changing my gender from female to male, or just completely removes it which skews the data collected. UPDATE: Developer was very quick to respond, however clearing the cache only seems to resolve the issue temporarily"
"Why do I need to give access to manage my calls for tracking my daily activity? This is ridiculous. I've been using the app for years, but I'm uninstalling it. Edit after Samsung's answer: saying that ""this is needed for providing an optimal experience""... Really? You need to manage my calls in a physical activity app? ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
"It is a stupid move that they removed the ability to measure SpO2 data, especially during this pandemic just to boost their sales on galaxy wearables. I'm a medical doctor so I know for a fact that those wearables ability to measure SpO2 is waaaay less accurate than those measured from a finger tip (that used to be available on my Galaxy S10+). It is just plain stupid."
"Can no longer customize a a workout. Running programs are just gone. Also too many permissions, I know, for better experience, not gonna use data for anything else, blah blah blah. Yeah right. Uninstalling."
"I just downloaded this app, I made an account. Went to sign in on my health app, and it wont let me sign in. It just kept spinning for about 25 min. It never signed me in. I tried clearing the cache...that didnt work. I spent another 30 minites....all it did was spin. I am frusterated to say the least!"
"Used the biometric scanner which gave me a warning about ""despite being average weight, your rapid weight gain might be a cause for concern"" after I gained 0.2kg Disgusting that a health app is making medically incorrect and harmful suggestions like this. Edit: Can't even report it as an error or a suggestion via the contact link in the app, every time I try to submit it won't go through."
"Everything is fine, but the step target changes by itself each day. I would have deducted only 1 star for that but the fact that it's frustrating keep changing it, it's worth 2 less stars. Edit - not syncing my account"
"Why is it when companies do ""UPDATES"" or ""IMPROVEMENTS"" it involves taking away features, very very disappointing... I use to use the blood glucose to monitor my blood sugar levels and I was able to see monthly averages that was very helpful to try to estimate my A1C.. NO LONGER DO I HAVE THE MONTHLY OPTION... VERY VERY DISSAPOINTING!!!! Something I had relied for on for years, got rid of all my other 3rd party aps because samsung health did all I needed.. now I need to look for a 3rd party app.."
"This App is simply awesome. It motivates me to concentrate on my physical fitness. One suggestion that still we have only 1:1 challenge option with friends,Instead group option enabled will be more fun and challenging."
"I use this app to track my blood oxygen level. But it was removed, they are saying its just included in stress tracking which is not even available to everyone ( all countries ). This rating is for the app developer who are suppose to make the app better for every user but instead made it almost useless to some people. Samsung needs to hire better app developers."
"Since update, steps not linking through to MyFitnessPal as they always have done previously. Can see your reply but we are UK so no,sorry not calling that number. Can see people have commented on myfitnesspal app reviews re same issue so something going on between the 2 systems."
"Please bring back the old look. It is 100% disfunctional. Tota chaos. It's the worst it has ever been. Please enable UGC/adding exercise such as HIIT and generic workouts with weights and kettlebells. It's kinda funny that you can enter bench presses as si gle exercise, but you cannot add generic workout routines (with burned cal value). User options are super limited as well as list of exercises."
"This app keeps giving me 'advice' about getting my heart rate correctly. I have several medical conditions so I need to check my heart rate several times per day. This app records them so I use it. I don't appreciate the unsolicited advice about how to take it correctly. If you guys are taking personal data and recording it, then you would know that my body has struggles. Please stop the advice. I don't need it. It's garbage and uncalled for."
Since the last update it won't keep the setting of miles for distance and keeps reverting back to kilometres. In fact all my preferred measurements revert back to the original settings. Please fix this.
I need to find a way to use a barcode scanner to track my food. I don't understand why your app does not include a barcode scanner like every other food tracking app does. I have MyFitnessPal and linked it to Samsung health in the settings on both apps. The food scanned into MyFitnessPal shows up in Samsung health with all the details except for the name of the food item. How do I correct this so I can see what I ate in the Samsung Health app or better yet scan a barcode using this app?
This was a good app however rating now downgraded as it will no longer be used due to it now expecting access to phone calls. I've only ever used it to monitor the occasional walks and my sleep patterns. What a shame as this now makes my Samsung watch rather redundant too.
"I have granted data permissions for third-party apps, but it no longer works and data is not being synced. Has been this way since 25 August. It is now useless and my Gear Fit is now also useless."
"Im dissappointed with the newest update because theres no weekly/monthly weight data whch the main reason i liked ths app so much . (Please add this back for the next update)N the food section has changed to vertical view . I like the previous arrrangement because i dont have to scroll down to add data . However , love the new icon , n lil features for the steps n sleep . I just need my weekly n monthly weight data back . Thank you !"
Seeing historical data is so much harder now. It really shouldn't be so hard to see how much you have done yesterday. The location and getting distance traveled is bad and unreliable. In the last year or two it's been getting worse
"I was enjoying the app until when it suddenly stopped running. I update and it worked for few days and now it has stopped. I have attempted to get it back on track for the past three days to no avail. In all, the app is spot on!"
"I love this app! But I have one little issue and I hope you can help me. Usually, I have a tab where I can record my stress levels, but now the tab is gone and I dont understand it. I looked it up and some people said that you need some kind of sensor to put your finger on. I thought of the sensor for unlocking my phone, but I dont know if that would work. Please help me :/"
"This app doesn't work, after installing it, you put in all information, register on website. Tells you to take a few steps and doesn't record the steps. Since, this app doesn't work the way it should, I can't get my Discovery vitality to work cause it's linked this crappy app."
This used to be my favorite app now I can officially say I absolutely hate it most of all the Freaking period tracker has become trash have been having trouble with it for about year now but for the past few months it has been garbage when i to put in my start date and save it it doesn't show up it still says period has been late or nothing at all and what the heck is up with calorie counter showing 500 cal and then 200 cal 10 mins later. I mean seriously üòí It is now 2022 yet no improvementsüòí
"App is decent by itself, problem is that it's draining my battery. Stays active all the time. Have to force quit the app every time I use it. Says in battery history background usage of 10hrs (the amount of time it's been open). Phone won't go in to standby.."
I keep trying to use the stress oxygen and pulse at the same time I don't move I've got it braced it'll keep going and then it stops it said put your finger back on or your fingers not in place I move it put it back my finger does not move it keeps saying the same thing I'm trying to get my oxygen rate it won't do anything but say you have to keep putting your finger back on right that really is very irritating Don't put that on an app if it doesn't work right.
I'm starting using of the app which synced with samsung gear sport as my every day tracker. I was user of Fitbit Charge 2 for 2 years as well. based my experince burning of about 600 calirie during of an hour pilates training is normal whereas samsung health (synced with gear sport) shows 305 calorie. I have no doubt that the tracking of calorie burning of samsung is inaccurate. i don't know the issue is software buge of samaung health app or hardware issue (maybe software) of gear sport watch.
"The sleep app use to have a better detail of REM, light And deep sleep. It's been inconsistent in taking all of that. My smart watch has been adjusted and still have trouble getting that info. Some days I do some I dont."
There are now ads for dog food and Sirius xm. Samsung native apps are garbage. ETA: the developer response is a blatant lie. You have banners and ads in nearly all of your native apps even the galaxy store. Android Authority has also written an article about it. I suggest you remove these ads and stop lying. I will definitely not consider a Samsung phone the next time I upgrade.
"The last software update ruined my app experience. After the software update my Samsung watch and the app won't sync up. I've uninstalled and reinstalled the app and reset my watch, it still won't sync up."
This app is bad I can't get the code so I can open it I have tried several times.
The app could have been perfect but somehow Samsung removed the historical routes after the walk / run. I remember this function was available back in early 2019 but then now it's only showing the general location :(
"I love everything about this app. The step counter, the bed time stories that help me fall asleep, without watching hours of TV. The relaxation suggestion, and the workouts."
"The new update is pure crapification*. How do I change Sleep Data background to WHITE instead of black! Deep Sleep % data is UNREADABLE due to TINY font and near ZERO contrast!! I literally have to use a magnifying glass to see percentage!! (Note 10+) *Crapification: Actions by which a product, process, or procedure that is currently working well and is meeting the needs of users, is changed and becomes less functional or effective as a result."
"Looks good and works well but when I compare my distances on Strava, or bike computer, the distances can be way off. Ex: Strava 72.8 miles, bike computer 72.07 miles, Samsung health 59. 57 miles. This makes it almost useless."
"Like others, I'm extremely disappointed in the removal of the weight management feature in the latest update. It was, in my opinion, one of the best features of the app. Now, there's not much that separates the service from others like MyFitnessPal."
"The updates removing functionality from this app without obvious reason are annoying. Latest examples: (a) Weight and fat% now only held daily (weekly and monthly averages have been removed. (b) Now only 4 food times, 3 meals + snacks (whereas previously there were 6 which more likely matches how people eat and it is easier to record the detail as you go). (c) Grams for Carbs and Fat are now removed, leaving only % and it isn't even % by weight! (Monitoring daily grams are much more important for an individuals health than a nebulous %). (d) Nutrition score factor removed. Why? This was helpful as a quick indicator of how user was going each day. (e) New interface is more ugly and harder to use. Not sure why impetus to change it. It would be good if all changes were removed and app went back to old version."
"This app is awesome for recording calories, exercise and basic health monitoring. I'd suggest something like a barcode scanner for adding certain items to the food as this would perfect the app."
I loved this app until they disallowed third party syncing. So now my Google Fit cannot sync with Samsung Health. I am not allowing myself to be forced to buy another Samsung device (smartwatch) in this money grab. I will continue using my fully functional non-Samsung smartwatch and just use Google Fit.
"Right now, I'm fairly disappointed. When I look at my averages of weight amounts, it's written as kg but says lbs after the kg number. I have no idea how to calculate my skeletal muscle or my body far for compositions, and you give no guidelines. I quit tracking my food, because everything is written metrically, when it's being proven that measuring liquids and weighing foods is a more accurate way to track food."
It was working good. New privacy policy needs make calls (I don't know why) and two steps verification (which is not working ). Disappointing and leaving Samsung health. Thank you samsung for the great service before this update. But now I am switching to another app.
"Great concept but is not accurate when counting steps. Always loses count around 8k to 9k steps. It will freeze and not count the steps. Also, I run the same route and it records different amount of milage."
"you're not testing your updates properly. I'm being left without functionality, many of which are covered in other reviews. How can this be acceptable. For over two weeks now I cannot access sleep data, and now so many apps fail to interface correctly with SH meaning that there is masses of missing information. I've found health apps so helpful to better my health, why do samsung insist on ruining this for their users? Why do you keep removing my review? This is the sixth time I've reposted it!"
I loved this app but now this app is just so horribly designed. It's confusing. It's ugly. I can't share things where I used to be able to there is nothing appealing about it. It's sad that they felt the need to change it all because they changed what was a very usable nice app into something that's just not functional.
Good app and its been reliable up until recently when Together stopped working. Now it keeps asking me to verify my account and when i click verify it gives me an error saying it couldn't verify my identity with no further instructions on what to do. Cant use that feature at all now
I believe that the new app will only work with other Samsung phones. I thought that it would work on my OnePlus nord10. And thought I had been using it. But now just spinning wheels. I tried hitting the back button but it goes to sign in
"After the update, the app refused to function properly. Afterwards, tried to uninstall then reinstall again, but the verification code is not being sent/received. Was using it regularly before but it is just disappointing the updates are causing these problems."
Love the app and it has a lot of potential. would be great if it would sync with more fitness apps and they would drop the ads at the top.
"Edit: Following my review, Samsung replied and expect me to call their US customer service centre to be patronised over the failings of their app, as if I can help fix the problem by wasting my time (and money) calling them over problems with an app downloaded over a billion times. I don't think so! How hard is it to improve an app without removing key features... Just read the reviews and look at your own change logs! ""Update has removed features, rather than add improvements. Why!?"""
I've used this app for about 3 years and has been happy with it. Have a note 9 now and the stress test hangs at 94% and won't finish. Please fix. I've uninstalled and reinstalled the app.
"An amazing app. I have been using for years, love the updates! One complaint food section where is the barcode option! Without it I can't use the food option which I loved!! Please bring it back!"
I used to use this app daily on my Samsung S9. The first problem arose when I upgraded to an S20 which didn't support a feature I used all the time (pulse oximeter) because the S20 doesn't have the sensor. The final straw was today when suddenly the app demanded that I give it permission to place phone calls and refused to let me use it unless I allowed that. I see NO valid reason for a fitness app to require permission to place phone calls in order for me to use it. I removed it from my phone
"I do not want to use my phone number to find my friends' account. But if I deny the app permission to access my phone number, contacts, and ability to make calls then it closes. Oh wait, I cant use the app anyway, because instead of manually creating a Samsung account I signed in with Google oauth. The app hits me with an error message about how my username doesn't exist and just logs me back out. My Galaxy Wearable is collecting dust because this app is unbearable. I'm buying a FitBit."
Can't use app anymore get a message box that says access denied unauthorized changes made to phone. Can't find error code in the help section of contact us. Android & Verizon just did a bunch of updates on my phone. Deleted & reinstalled same error.
It keeps stalling and I have to go into the app settings to do a forcestop all the time. 30/12/2018 I tried clearing the cache. Worked for a short while and back having to forcestop to get the app to track.
Only sleep information were send through Android Health Connect. And be careful many functions were limited to Galaxy phones
"1st, maybe get a live person to answer complaints or suggestions instead of canned auto responses, it would at least give the appearance that you care. Required phone permission new after updating. Will not work if not given. I will delete it from phone if not changed. Update, app deleted after Samsung refused to allow use without mining your contacts. You loose another customer with your intrusive requirements. As I replace my electronics I will remember Samsungs predatory business practices."
"Since the latest update I continuously get a pop up that says Samsung Health has stopped. I have tried clearing the cache, force stopping the app, and restarting my phone. It's frustrating to say the least!"
"Weight management needs to be reinstalled ASAP. I've lost a considerable amount of weight using this app & it's so disappointing to lose the weight management section. Used to tell everyone it was a 5 üåü app, now its only 1 üåü. All it is now is a calorie counter.!"
I could do without the semi-pornograghic bait ads on the step tracker. I haven't clicked them but they look like Male attention grabbers disguised as health features. I otherwise really like the app but will not continue to put up with them. I would appreciate them being removed or having an option to remove them or I will stop using the app.
"App won't open. Same as all complaints w/ new version. Tried clearing cache, forcing stop and restarting phone. Nothing worked. I'm not based in the US nor would like to call a phone to fix the app."
"Ads on top?!? No thank you! I used to enjoy this app on my S8. Now it's just a glorified ad delivery system. Samsung, I will buy your products and affiliated ones if I want them. But I will seek them out myself. I don't want you raping my mind with your adverts on the health app. Never using it again."
The calendar in the Weekly Summary section is stuck on the week of 05/29/2022 - 06/04/2022 so everything I did this week is not showing in the Weekly Summary and it DOES NOT give me option to manually change the calendar to the current week! VERY ANNOYING! üò° I'm about to delete the app and find another one to use! üò° AND CLEARING THE CACHE DOES NOT WORK!
"I was staying on track and losing weight. But when the update took away the weight management, I started using the app less and less. I may look for another app all together and just uninstall this one."
"Won't open, just spinning circle. Can't share from Dexcom G6 because I can't even get to the Eula to accept terms. UPDATE 02/2021 Love, love, love. I would like the option to manually add exercise, but the last update has allowed me to use my Samsung Galaxy Watch Active with my non-samsung android phone. Thank you, updating review to 5 stars."
"The heart rate dashboard is simply wrong; it doesn't account for recorded heart rate from Strava-uploaded biking sessions. For example, my biking session has my max heart rate of 162 BPM but the app's heart rate trend only shows the heart rate that was recorded by my Samsung Watch S2 and my manual heart rate measure with my Samsung smartphone - which is significantly lower BPMs. The app also tries to compare your ""health"" to a larger, participating population. But it only does it on the number of steps, not overall activeness, weight, heart rate, etc. It seems that Samsung ran out of will power and just did half a job"
"I used samsung health for a long time, but as I updated it , the new policy of two step verification doesn't act and although the verification code is being sent ,this step repeats again and again ,so I can't get through the app. It was really frustrating, and unwillingly I uninstalled samsung health. I think this new policy restricts using of this handy app."
"Wants to manage and make phone calls or you can't use it now. There is no need for an app mainly used as a pedometer to need that permission. Reply: If this was in any way true, you would listen to what people are saying. We don't want you invading our privacy we just want an app.that works. I don't want to give all these permissions for an app you constantly butcher. I don't need you looking at my contacts for a pedometer."
continuously tells me that the app can't open on a rooted phone for security reasons. Except my phone is not rooted. It works again after rebooting for a short while then the error comes back.. This should NOT be an issue. Last Samsung device.
"I used to like it a lot more, this new interface like many have mentioned requires more scrolling and searching for what used to be easy to read in a glance. I do like that there seems to be more foods in the database which is helpful."
You guys rocked this App :() I have had this App for a long time but never really paid attention to it. Now that I have started to take care of myself. [This App does an amazing job of helping me to take care of myself for ‚ô§‚ô°‚óáJESUS‚ôß (1 Corinthians 6:19-20)] Thankyou so much for making an App so carefully and skillfully and so greatly thought out [and the way it lines up with my Samsung Note 8 phone] can take readings like stress level/oxygen/pulse/ etc. right from the sensor on the back of the phone! *I especially love the meal management/water management/weight management. Thankyou for making this App *THE BEST OF THE BEST*
"I started using this app/feature a couple of days ago, and then i updated and it threw me off because i now don't know if i'm on track with my calorie intake, the scale of 'under, good & over' has gone so i'm really not sure if i'm on track. Please could you put it back to how it was because i am so thrown off, and at judging by the comments, i'm not the only one. Please correct this app/feature. Many thanks."
"I like using this app to count my daily steps at evening when I go for a walk. But these days suddenly my steps go from 250 to 5000 in a second without even walking. And when I check the time of when these steps were added it shows 6 am, but it was 250 a minute ago then how come I completed 5000 steps at 6 am in morning when I was asleep. And it happens almost everyday. My daily goal is 12000 so it causes problem with that. Plz fix the glitch and add an option to reset my step count of the day."
"Overall happy with this. Two things. I moved to a new phone and now I've lost three years of history and the voice ""Workout paused"" sounds like they are breathing helium. How can I fix this?"
"Until recently this app was everything I was looking for, however in the past month the gps does not accurately track my route. It shows I never get home anymore and shows only the shortest route between point A and B. Any help would be appreciated"
"I rated this app as 1 star because there are ads running constantly. This would use up battery time and is annoying. I took galaxy wear off of my mobile because of the constant notifications asking me to install Samsung health. I refuse to pit this on my mobile because of the constant ad interference. Please could this be rectified. I have just re installed galaxy wear today because I want to use my wrist band, and still the notifications for Samsung health keep coming. Thanks"
"I love this app. It tracks my steps automatically, I can set and monitor goals and I can add additional tracking options to help me achieve my health goals. Been using it for years now."
this app worked great for a year and suddenly my monthly steps challenge is no longer updating as of about a week ago. not sure what the issue is. I did an update and no change.
Parochial. Will only work with Samsung fitness monitors.
"One step forward, two steps back! - this is what Samsung managed with their big update. It's way too simplified and a lot of important features have been REMOVED. Now, I have to again find an alternative app."
"In the March 2022 updated version, recording the blood pressure is slightly more user-friendly than in the version immediately before that. However, it is still not as good as the format for recording that was in earlier versions of the app."
"Works so much better after update. New interface will take so getting used to, but I think it is better than previous interface. Really helps me track my steps to get more walking in each day!"
"I love this app. It's more helpful than I thought, it has workouts and tons of info. You can enter nutrition for food, fast food items and it's been accurate. I don't use anything else"
"Great App , just 1 problem you have widgets from the app available on my watch for all things like water, food etc but not the blood glucose one would like to record my BG reading manually using just my watch. Anything I am missing here would be great aside from changing my meter to a supported one."
"""cant be opened on a rooted phone"" error constantly popping up. even when clicking OK. phones not rooted but has developer mode enabled so i can set my animations quicker on the home screen. force close app works to stop but msg returns when re opened app."
The workaround I have now painstakingly set up on my GW4C and Pixel 6 in order to unlock blood pressure and ECG proves there is no reason these features should be locked exclusively to Galaxy phone users. Glad I got the watch at a significant discount and the workaround exists - utterly laughable to charge so much for a device and then gimp it unless you buy into the entire ecosystem. Nothing but pure greed.
"The latest update makes the app useless. You can't even open the app unless you grant access to permissions that the app has no need to access. It was doing what I needed it to do before. And I'm not buying the ""oh just trust us. What could possibly go wrong."" responses to other similar reviews."
I like most of the tracking except meals. as you pick foods it adds to the list. the list is too long and I can't eliminate the foods is don't eat. also many foods are duplicated several times.
"Lots of bugs, often have to uninstall and reinstall. Also, for the challenge, it would be great to be able to set the pacer before starting the challenge."
"What the hell?! Went to do my stretches and workouts and record my daily activity and nothings friggen loading. Reinstalled the app. Tried different connections, reset my wifi and nothing. This app is useless now. A shame because I loved it."
"Ever since the last update, the oxygen sensor is way off. And half the time it will give me an error and not read at all. Also the step count isn't automatically updating with my watch."
The new update makes logging on basically impossible and redundant because it keeps asking if it can send a message and when it comes you still can't log on after adding the code. Ijust uninstalled it it's a waste of time.
"When I start my workout for evening walk and capture duration on this app. Simultaneously if I listen to music on another app, it does not captures the data instead it reflects Auto Stop."
Ever since the last update the app has stopped telling me how far I have ran (I had it set to every 0.5km) with my pace etc. These notifications used to come through over my running music app and were great. Now it is useless! Dont tell me you will pass this feedback on to your developers. How do I revert to the last version?
Not bad until I was forced into 2 step verification. So secure I can't use the app. So incredibly frustrating. Reinstalling the app seemed to allow me access now. Unfortunately it also reset my watch so all the things I was tracking are gone
"I used to love this app because not only gave me my daily moving steps tally but also when I hiked I used to chose hiking for exercise at the end of the hike, it used to give me how many miles, how long it took AND included a map which allowed me to save as GPX for future if I want to do the same hike again but now it does not give me anything besides from what time to what time I hiked, no map, no mileage, no calories, not time it has become completely useless. What happened here to the app?"
"App was garbage before it completely broke. All I want is to track my sleep and since the last update I can't even log in. Tells me I need to set up 2FA, I do it, then the app crashes. Samsung has been terrible at software for years and at this point I'm done. Never buying a Samsung product again."
"It seems like every single time an update to this app is made, it completely screws the Oxygen Saturation measurement to where you cannot measure it, it stops working completely every time. You know this and still won't make the necessary changes to fix it"
"Although the recent update demanded additional permissions, I agreed, then removed them again through the phone's app settings menu. I've not seen any features that I was using stop working yet. We'll see whether Samsung correct that next update."
Its okay. Since they took off weight managment a month or so ago its not much worth using. It does keep track of your weight when you input it and also tracks your step but without the other feature i wouldnt reccomend it.
"After the update it does not work anymore. Now I have to register and sign in to Samsung Health which I NEVER wanted to do at the beginning (and I'm not going to). It was working fine, I don't see a reason why I have to register. I want my steps counted, I don't want any offers, ads or to register to use this app on MY phone that I can't even uninstall."
I've been using this app to track my bicycle rides. The past week or so it hasn't been working like it was before. Now when I start a new ride the app goes into pause mode within a minute of a ride while I'm moving and will not come out of pause.
"Used to be a 5 star app but usability and history views were ruined. Can't see the most useful charts of weekly or monthly historical averages anymore. Everything is daily now 1, 7 or 31 days at a time, just repeated information, pretty useless. Activity averages are no longer broken down by activity type. Thumb level tabs to switch between daily, weekly and monthly views has moved to a tiny icon at the top for the new useless views making one handed operation impossible."
Brilliant great motivator and companion to aid access to all the fitness motivation you need. Whether just being healthier or for weight loss. You can use it with friends to help inspire each other too. great app.
"I really love the step counter, and being able to measure your heart beat. I wish there were more widgets available, and I also wish there was a barcode scanning option to count your calories."
"I use this app for basic health goals. It's great to motivate me to do some walking. It has a lot of problems recording exercise with the Samsung Galaxy Active Watch 2, but does everything I need it to."
Everything seem to be working great except the calorie tracker. It would be nice to have scanning available like fitness pal. Also would like an ability to manually add excercise.
"Great app, but it is absolutely ridiculous that us in Canada can't check our O2 anymore because it has been integrated into a stress service feature not available in our country. Can you fix the O2 monitoring for us? Sucks that we have the capability but not the ability."
"App used to be great but now the app can only show my phone step count or my phone AND other device step counts together but not only my step count from my galaxy watch. This leaves me with a very inaccurate step count that also influences other health indicators. Unfortunately unusable now. Please Samsung, solve this issue!!!"
Samsung I like the new update I think it looks awesome and work great but a couple of things I wish it had one it would be great if you could put in how much weight you lifting in your workout sets and I don't understand why you can't use this app in split screen mode like the under armour app the Endomondo app and evenly the Google fit app you can hopefully you can make this happen kept up the good work üòÄ
"I will not be using this app after the April 2021 update when it made it mandatory for you to access all my contacts or app doesn't work. It worked fine before without having this infringement of my privacy so please LISTEN TO THE 500+ people who, it seems, are also incensed with this situation so they too have also left 1* reviews to that effect."
"This app is great. I use it every single day to track various health habits, including weight, sleep, blood pressure etc. The only thing I did wrong was to root my previous device, and by doing so, I couldn't use Samsung exclusive features anymore on that phone. When I bought my actual phone, it was great. I'm now able to use everything that didn't work on my rooted one. Don't know why people rate this app so bad, maybe all of their phones are poor or rooted too."
Loved this App til they took away my main reasons for using it. I work out and need to keep track of my weight and food intake to make sure I'm working out right. Now I'm praying the Samsung Active Watch 2 has a 3rd party app that worked just as good or the Watch is just as useless as the App and it's bye bye my 5 Samsung devices. üò°
"Overall a good app, but it has some weird bugs and missing functions. -auto recorded sleep time can't be changed -app crashes constantly when i try to download my personal data -some other small bugs"
Your last update just broke the app. it says the app has a security issue and won't open on a rooted phone (which mine is not). The app keeps launching itself just to say that every 5 seconds. Uninstalling until I hear it's fixed
"The app seems to go into ""sleep mode"" every time i stop walking, and it doesnt ""wake up"". Has to pause and resume to ""wake up"" the app to resume counting."
"Have the new Galaxy 4 watch which doesn't seem to track steps on a treadmill very well. I wish the app would auto calculate steps when you manually enter in the distance on a treadmill work out so it can be relected in daily steps. I also wish you could manually adjust calories as I use my treadmill on an incline which burns a lot more calories. At this rate, I will never meet any goals but active minutes."
"Great app. It's awesome for accountability and the joy of reaching each goals is just nice. However, I feel some people are messing with the step counts, how are they getting 98000 steps in a day or a million steps in less than 20 days."
"This is a very good app. Especially in this age it has most everything. It tracks activities, food/drink, sleep and for me most important - BP, HR, Glucose, and O2. I just wish it had temperature and an easy way to export it to excel or such. Then it would be perfect."
It was a great app until the weight management function was removed. I would also like if the step tracker also took treadmill running into consideration. Please put the weight management function back in the next update.
"*edit* I would love to follow the instructions in your reply, BUT I CANNOT MOVE PAST THE PHONE NUMBER SCREEN.I have been using this app for years and i have enjoyed it very much but this current update seems to have a bug or something. I go in to accept new privacy policy it then asks me to set up 2 step authentication which I am trying to do but it sends me into a continuous loop of ""register phone number"" to ""ok"" then back to ""register phone number"" I cannot access the app at all at this time."
"I am not happy that Samsung suddenly wants all these permissions from my phone. Big Big Big security risk and red flag! I do not agree that the information is only for my benefit and will not be used for other purposes. I have always loved Samsung products, but this may now be a deal breaker for me. The generic response to everyone should be paid attention to. If the majority of people don't like the update for obvious reasons, then you need to roll back and give us what we are happy with."
I have experienced that step counting sometimes didn't work. I walked out for more than 15 minutes however step counting was same as before. This happened several times. Please check and fix any bug.
"This app is getting worse with every update and measuring less and less. 6k walked today, and 500 steps recorded! üò° Since the last update steps aren't being measured correctly. Another pedometer app I have read the same as hers yet my Samsung Health one was wildly out. And AGAIN just as it starts to count steps properly its 'updated' and stops. I've followed Samsung's advice on resetting it etc and it's made no difference"
Works great with all of my Samsung gear. Could be 4-5 star if the search option algorithm worked better on finding the correct food. Would definitely be a 5 star if there were a barcode scanner to add in foods and drinks.
With the latest update I am not receiving weekly summary now which I found really useful for keeping track of everything. Is there some way to get this feature back? Also huge drain on my battery. I thought it was just getting old but after reading other reviews I see this is a big problem with a lot of users.
"I loved this for over 2 years, then it began to stop, not function properly, shut off, etc. I uninstalled it the reinstalled it, but it no longer announced my data at each mile. It was silent. Frustrating."
"I gave your app five stars but it needs some improvements for sure and I know you will do that. For instance I preferred to see other people posts in their profile too, but it seems we just can see them in the public posts and after that, they all disappear. And we can not connect with each other with chatting too, I preferred we could because it can make us more active when we know the challenger is a human not a robot. Anyway thanks for the appüôèüôèüôèüå∑üå∑üå∑"
"Got current version on new S10 and having trouble with the step counter. Did a 3k walk and registered as only 2000 steps, should be more like 4500. Not sure if it is the phone or the app version, but unhappy with the performance as I am currently in a challenge and am now short on steps."
"I have never signed in and now you require me to sign in to use the app? Welp... that's the end of my using Samsung Health So Samsung replies ""Since the latest update, Log-in with Samsung Account is required to access Samsung Health. To resolve the issue you will need to create a Samsung account"" That shows you that they do not actually READ the review. I do not wish to share information with Samsung, all I did anyway was to see how many steps I was doing that day and now that does not work without being signed in SO!!!! Application removed. How many steps is not worth sharing P.I."
"It's basically nothing but a pedometer now. This worked great on older phones; you could get highly accurate OxSat and pulse and even sleep pattern readings with built in sensors on the phone. Now the $2,000 I spent on a phone isn't enough and Samsung wants me to buy additional gadgets to monitor anything else."
"In general, it's really good app with precise tracking and nice GUI. But, as every app from Samsung, it can't be linked with Google apps (Google Fit). Also same thing with smartwatches .. truly disappointing"
"I don't care if my phone acess is for the 'optimal experience', you're not getting it and I'm deleting the app. You made such a mistake with this and lost so many users. Also, not in the USA, I won't call the number you keep spamming nor will I go to your site to contact you. Goodbye Samsung Health."
"Very disappointed. Thought this was going to be a great thing to help me track my steps, food intake etc. Worked great for a day or so then stopped tracking. I even Started and restarted my phone. Nothing. Grr"
Pointless! It no longer gives you the option it to only record steps from your Samsung watch. When you carry your phone on a run or a walk or a workout it doubles your step count. What's the point?
I have to track sugar intake separately from meal tracking I'm only here for meal tracking
"Demands access to a ton of privacy invasive permissions without any explanation as to why it requires them (which, by the way, violates the developer policies, so the app shouldn't have even been approved), and refuses to launch if you deny them. Even when I did give them it claimed I needed to sign in to a Samsung account and then closed the app, without giving me any way of signing in to such an account."
Step counts quite significantly different to mapping app and step counter. Can't use a barcode to track food (or if you can i sure haven't found it in) As much as I'd love to keep using it doesn't offer me the things I need
"Couldn't even connect a Samsung Galaxy watch. I'm pretty tech savvy and I was not able to connect my galaxy watch even though it was connected to my galaxy phone. My Omron blood pressure device, same story. I was able to connect my Yunmai scale easily though. Frustrating."
I reinstalled the app and reset the settings. It now records my walking info and route but oxygen level and heart rate aren't even appearing. I have cleared the cache. Do you no longer provide the opportunity to check oxygen and heart rate? Do I need to buy another item? The app I downloaded to check oxygen and heart rate won't appear on my app options. Please answer my questions.
"I don't give it 5 stars because it doesn't keep track of how many kilometers I've walked. Only the shows step records. How difficult can it be to add to the history how many kilometers or miles I have walked? I walk a lot every week, I'd love to keep track on this app instead of installing another one"
It appears that this app is reminding me to drink water EVERY time I try to do ANYTHING on my phone. I hate it. It interferes with answering the phone or seeing a text or turning off an alarm.
Why should I have to sign in to your server to track my steps when my phone is perfectly capable on its own?! It used to without having to sign in!! What's next? Pemissions to view my pics and place phone calls??? My health is personal info! There is NO legitimate reason for your requirements with this functionality of MY cell phone!
"Edit: the update takes my one star to three for now. I love the new challenges. Still want a food scanner and I'd like to view my weight chart over weeks, months, and years."
The app suddenly started to request permission to use PHONE and insists on 2 step verification. I do not need 2 step verification. I dont care who knows how many steps I walk per day. It is overkill. There MUST be an option for the app to work without using phone permission and without 2 step verification.
"It was good up until about 6 months ago, now with the added permissions required and the fact that even after granting the permissions (temporary anyway) i can't get into the app as it is giving me a ""your session expired, please sign into your Samsung account again"" i am uninstalling. Samsung's generic replies are a joke. Good bye"
Love the app cannot use with update. It is requiring permission to access and manage my phone calls. That is not necessary for an app that cannot make phone calls. If not changed I will be deleting app.
1/27/2021 update After the latest update from the Play Store I was able to login to the Samsung server quickly. The app started syncing with my watch immediately. App doesn't connect to Samsung server. Unable to use.
This is excellent app for fitness I was very disappointed with other pedometer apps the apps doesnt track the correct steps and even i was not knowing that my mobile (samsung galaxy j7 nxt) contains even this app and i found the app and i started walking it was really good the only thing is there is no water reminder in this app can u please add the water reminder option other than the app is perfect and if u add the water reminder option it could become a perfect fitness app for samsung mobiles
"Great companion for tracking fitness, weight and calorie intake. Fully customisable interface that's also really easy to use and view trends over time. Works perfectly with Galaxy Watch Active 2."
"Uninstaloed. Does not work properly on Samsung Galaxy S8. Distances are way off the mark. Tried suggestions from customer support to no avail. Tried this app a few years ago on a Note 4. Same problem today. Don't you test on your own devices, Samsung??? I bicycle. Going back to Strava. It always works and is accurate."
Can't even use this app any more since the update as I can't do the 2 step verification. I live in the Falkland Islands which is not listed in the choice of countries phone numbers so I can't get the verification code. It's probably great if I could set it up!
It has a lot of information and it makes exercising fun. The feature that allows you to track stress level is very cool! The list of foods to track calories is really good.
"Prior to an update, my Galaxy watch logged all my fitness info with my Note 8. Now my watch has real time info and the app updates hours later. I've opened up the app and re-chose Galaxy watch and nothing. WTH! 5-9-2019...just called the number left in the Samsungs reply to my post AND it sounds like a fax machine. AGAIN no success with this whole app or help."
"Active watch 2 is 425.00 that was going to connect to health app.. Dies in15 min. Even with wifi, Bluetooth, location, all turned off. If you use the phone dies in 3 min. Nothing like they said it would be. Now you want two step authorization so you can keep texting me with junk mail. NO WAY. This is more of a hassle and invasion to my health and privacy. Samsung tech couldn't help. I went back to Fitbit and purchased a Sensa 2."
"Removal of calorie and weight management features have rendered the app useless. Seems i will be forced to go to a fitbit in order to have all the features I need. Too bad, because Samsung health used to be superior before they arbitrarily removed features."
"Why did you remove the best feature Weight Management? The option still displays on my Galaxy Watch, yet I can't set a target or amend my current target on my watch. Basically watch functionality is now broken. Who chose the colour scheme for this update? Was it created as a joke? Take note of your customers, they want the weight management functionality restoring. EDIT: Tired of waiting for a fix. Now ordered the new Fitbit versa. I have replaced S Health with Fitbit and Nutracheck App."
"Congratulations for the application and new features added. I will suggest to consider the following. 1. Except ""Fat %"", will be a good idea to add ""Muscle %"" Visceral Fat"" plus few extra (blank) fields (as an option)  which can be activated and named by the User and use them in the Database, so anybody can record other parameters. 2. The sleep option can have more intelligence! Not logical to suggest ""sleep time""  period when at that time it recorded walking/movement. Same applies in the morning when someone wakes up and pick up the phone. 3, It would be a good idea if all manufacturers/providers/Google e.t.c. can standardize a Personal Database which can include and record all identical values, instead of everybody is using it's own."
Used it few years ago and found a great app as at that time samsung heath was with alot of feature like how much to walk to reduce weight in targeted time. Plus coach with sound..Now lack these so i have downloaded multiple time and deleted and now again..
"I do not want to give Samsung Health permission to do anything other than record my health information. If you do not allow the permissons, you get kicked off the app. BIG BROTHER is watching us and for no reason other than just being nosy or using our phone numbers for nefarious reasons. I want to know how much I walked and how much I slept. I do not know why I have to give away my life history to get those two things. I have uninstalled and resinstalled a number of times trying to get around allowing Google to use my phone. Your snooping has nothing to do with my overall experience except it makes it worse wondering who you are calling using MY telephone number."
"Helped me to lose 29kgs=63.9lbs and made me able to track my workouts, steps, food, sleep, calories burned and how many cups of water I drink a day. This app is pushing me to buy Samsung's new Active smart watch though my phone is HTC U12+ but I had Samsung S7 Edge, and by this I mean this application is compatible with any other phones. So happy that the new Mindfulness update is available in my country, and specially that they created Mindfulness by teaming up with Calm! Great job Samsung‚ù§Ô∏èüèã"
"I have used this app for the past 6yrs but since the new privacy update on 6/25, I will no longer be using this app. In the new privacy policy, that they want they are allowed to collect all your data. Contacts information, 3rd party apps, geolocation, personal information, etc. They also want you to agree that they can use that information how they want, which could include selling your information. I find this highly invasive and will no longer be using them or recommend them."
"Doesn't work with Pacer, half the time doesn't sync with Strava; Galaxy Fit is horrible and shuts off in middle of exercise. Samsung Health then won't let you adjust anything when it is wrong- sleep, exercise activities. Can't get help in English without calling."
"Requires too many intrusive permissions before it will even function. I only need the app to measure my pulse and sp02 levels. I do not require additional ""together"" functionality. You do not need access to my phone or contacts to measure my pulse. Uninstalling"
"Extremely pathetic reply regarding my problem...the app isnt working without two step verification and the verification seems to have some problem...pressing AGREE should be enough for agreeing to your policies...every body knows that even if we dont agree to your terms n condition, still it doesnt change a thing...Extremely annoying situation...üò°üò°üò°"
I loved the app until it got buggy and wouldn't save my information or load properly. I updated the app and now it's telling me it won't load on a rooted phone and I most definitely have never rooted my phone so I can't use the app anymore. I'd love to see some kind of work around!
"You are forcing me to buy a Samsung watch or band! I can't use my oxygen monitor on my phone. That was already able to be used on that phone. After the glass broke on my samsung watch after one month, and glass wasn't covered. I swore I wouldn't buy another one! Now as soon as my phone dies, that's on my do not repurchase list."
Stopped using this app about 1-2 years ago. I came back because I like the whole steps challenges. I've noticed lately that my steps have not been recording at all. Just might erase this app and stick with the one I'm using now.
"My Gear 2 watch will not measure my oxygen saturation on my Note 10+. I have tried everything and looked everywhere and there is not a fix to be found. The oxygen sensor was the only reason why I was really using the app. It was a great app, but now I have no reason to continue using it. Hopefully it's fixed soon."
"So that is why, i am wandering why the calorie balance gage was suddenly missing in the dashboard. It was very useful guidance for me. I thought i changed some settings accidentally. Samsung may consider bringing it back."
"From 5 stars to 1 star. Why ""update"" the app to be far less intuitive, informational, and just plain functional. Just please put everything back to the way it was. This update was NOT improvement, it was quite the opposite."
"Really enjoyed this app until recently. I no longer can use it, unless i allow access to my contacts, phone calls and camera. Why?! Used to use the step readings, as a guide for how far I walked with my dogs. Occasionally used the heartbeat and oxygen stats, all now is defunct, unless I allow this massive invasion of my privacy!"
"Please do not change this app. Im able to keep track of my diabetes, as it links to other software to show my doctors the milage of walking or from biking. Great App! Accessories are the only downside, which I need to find a coupon."
An excellent motivator to get up and get moving. I've been walking and exploring new paths and enjoying new places. Every step counts and because of the leader board I've pushed myself to do one step more to climb that ladder.
Rated 1 star because of new outdoor swimming mode inaccuracies. GPS is totally incorrect. Sometime even cannot detect. Calories count is rubbish which I swam 15mins and the watch counted me for 9110kCal. Data precise is so important for health app. Please well prepare before you launch new mode.
"New fitness section with workouts is great. Hopefully it expands more. Wish there could be stress alerts displayed on my Galaxy watch4. Measurements for steps, oxygen, stress seem to be accurate so far! Would 5 star for stress alerts."
"Does not track steps when I close out of the app. And it doesn't start a work out, the auto pause is takes to long. Over all the results are similar to my Galaxy watch 4."
"I keep getting ""For your security, Samsung Health cannot be open on a rooted phone"", but I did not rooted my phone ever since. I saw that you all have replied to a feedback saying that should reboot our mobile device then try again, now just because a problem of 1 app caused and we have to reboot our whole device? Also, has tried to uninstall and reinstall but it still keep popping out automatically. Please fix it!"
"I've had the same problem manually entering my weight and BP... I select a date then try to change the time and then either crashes to dashboard or out of app altogether.. I've cleared cache and forced stop, but no better... tried restarting phone... nogo that route either... ?"
"It was perfect untill the recent updates.I use and track running activities and I am no longer able to use it as it shows wrong data...It doubles the time of activity and calories,therefore it is useless."
We have started having problems of our updating our challenges it takes up to 24 hrs for it to upload. We doesn't have any problems worth it for a few months this just started about 3 weeks ago. We love being able to challenge others. Please fix the lagging.
"Have multiple health issues and multiple health trackers for monitoring them as well as sharing with doctors. Trying to find an app that will work with as many of the trackers as possible. I really like the Samsung Health as I can check SpO through the phone sensor (did not know I had one) and it connected with all but two apps I use. One is an app for my oximeter but since Samsung health will measure it for me its no problem. The other is the Omron Connect app but Samsung Health will not connect to it instead taking me to Google Play where it says the Omron Connect app is not available in my country. Omron BP monitors are very popular so why Samsung Health cannot connect to the US Omron Connect is very confusing. If this was corrected, I would likely give this app 5 stars."
I work a third shift job. This app automatically sets my goals asif I should be working a first shift job. It just really irks me when I keep seeing my sleep goals need to be the hours I am working. I also don't like the fact that I can't manually put my workouts in because sometimes it's a spontaneous workout between tasks at work or other things in life. I do like the monthly challenges and access to already made workouts when I'm too brain dead to make my own.
Tried what they said but unable to do. Have to turn off phone every day or else it doesn't count any steps. Have to install everyday as only way it sometimes works . So disappointed as always used this App on old phone. A71 now and doesn't work
"good app overall for tracking basic workouts but missing detailed options like google fit has, such as circuit training etc. This makes the app not accurate at calories burned. It is nice that there is a calorie counter built in as well as BMI calculator."
I used to like this app until my 2 years data disappeared. Try to do a synchronization from the app but is not working. Trying to get from customer service to fix the glitch seems to be a waste of time
"Be good if it was compatible with other manufacturers wearables Update: Down to 1 star as after update wants permission to make calls & won't let me use the app unless I give permission. Since my last review, which no action was taken, I had brought myself a Samsung Watch so I could use the app seamlessly. Now not using the app until the permission change back to what they were. Not happy."
Was amazing until they removed all the best features but the thing that gets me the most is i can't sync from my polar beats app and refuse to use this app to link with my Polar heart rate monitor. Samsung seems to be going downhill again so I will be moving to ios
"I use S10+ Snapdragon variant. I prefer to have some tweaks and modifications sometimes here and there. I have tripped Knox and voided my warranty. And that's OK with me. It is expected that I void my warranty once I modify my device. However, it is unacceptable that I will be denied using some vital apps like S Health, even when I have returned to the stock ROM. I paid some lofty price for this device and now I can't use it as I intend? Answer me Samsung!"
Used to be very good to use and all data auto loaded onto app from watch like sllep steeps and heart now its only working manualy and slowly as well. I was using to help manage crps diesase but now its almost usless. Please fix auto load data and notifications. Note 9 with galaxy watch.
I really do not like the new widget update. You have made the writing smaller for step count but also kept the widget so big that theres a huge gap between the step count and heart monitor. Please either make the step count number big again or allow us to customise the widget by being able to make it smaller etc. I can also send screenshots to make my point if there is an email address.
I have downgraded my rating for this app. the reason for it is because Samsung blocks certain letter combinations. As an example you cannot use the word pass. when you use it others will see p***. this is one example of hundreds of other common words that Samsung will not let you use.
"I love that I can keep all my info together in one spot. My only suggestion or want, would be to have a place to list my medications with a reminder or to sync with the app I use for that purpose. Then all my things would be in one place. But I love it anyway."
Voice guidance during a workout using the Pacesetter no longer working in the current version 6.6.0.029. I tried calling the number to no avail. I have had to downgrade to version 6.5.0.039 to get the Pacesetter voice guidance working again. There is clearly a bug in version 6.6.0.029.
Love that app! Great calorie counting and interactive linking. Once I can track boxing with my Samsung watch it will get 5 stars if fitbut can do it there is 0 reason you can't! Tracking boxing with my phone vs other workout on the watch is a difference of over 200 calories!
Buggy and unreliable. Most of the times it randomly stops and does not update the step count. With each update the experience has become worst and worst. Avoid at all costs.
"It used to have Oxygen absorption. NOT ANYMORE Update: 12th Feb 2021. With recent update, Stress doesn""t work, stops T 95%, with no Oxygen level. Uninstalled and re-installed again, SAME RESULTS. WHY DO YOU FOLKS BREAK THE ONE IS NOT WORK!!!! What a wonderful service !!!! Changing it back to 5 from 1*. Sync first, clear cache, uninstall & reinstall this helped."
"I used the app for keeping track of step counts, heart rate and pulse ox. After the new update and the app wanting phone and contact permissions I deleted it. There's no reason for Samsung to monitor who I talk to or when I talk to them. And after reading the reviews on similar comments I'm pretty sure this comment will get the standard response that every one else did. I've always been a Samsung user but seriously starting to consider an IPhone."
App locked up and I had to uninstall. Reinstalled to find that out wants more permissions like contacts and calling (getting rid of that real quick) AND it lost all of my progress. Awesome. Y'all really earning this one star.
"Worked well with my galaxy watch 4 until the latest update. Now it wont show any heart rate data for any exercises. I can see my heart rate during exercises, so i know its working. Hope u get this fixed with a quick update. Apps pretty useless for me without the heart rate data."
The new UI is pathetic. One should indeed talk to the designer what knowledge he has about screen real estate? Feature wise this is a great and dependable app. The monthly contest should have more variances for different level of people so that they are engaged for complete month
I used to love this app but it no longer has the heart rate or spo2 monitor. Not even in the stress section. All it has is breathing. It's one of the things I loved about my NOTE but now I'm just disappointed. Even the mileage is way off for walking. I contacted and the reply did not help
"Still deleting my review to boost ratings. Such a joke Samsung. Required phone permission to access my phone number? Interesting. I didn't realize my phone number, let alone the phone in general, had anything to do with counting steps and other activity. Absurd. Find an alternative way."
I've been using this app for a long time and like it. But the last update broke things really bad. Every second search in the food logger either freezes the app or just doesn't respond. Please fix.
"can't open it after update. what ""service experience"" is improved by accessing contacts etc? please list the improvements. the experience was fine before. I don't use the together feature, so have no need to enable access to contacts"
I have used this app for several years and really enjoyed it. Now it takes me 3 or more clicks to enter my information. This morning it took 5 minutes to figure out where to enter my weight. Why would you update the app to be harder to use? Did you test it on people who used it or only your staff? Big disappointment! Looking for a new app.
"Over the last 18 months, samsung have destroyed this app. Its now pretty much useless as a health and fitness tracker, which makes all samsung watches useless and pointless also. Maybe listen to your customers feedback rather than replying to every bad review with the same generic reply about 'we will let our developers know' enough is enough. Never will I buy another samsung watch."
It would be great if the app had a barcode scanner for recording specific calories. It would me much easier and much more accurate! Please fix this!!!
"Again like many here have already said there is no need to have the extra permisions! And the usual reaponse from samsung does not wash, no you do not need access to my contacts, you do not need access to my phone log to identify me, you do not need access to my mic! This is again an insdious way of setting up for future invasive data collection and control alot like the forced tracking on our phones! Reply: to samsung.. no you do not need these permisions to identitfy me! They are invasive!"
"Have had this app on my last 3 Samsung phones and used it a lot but now it wants to ""Make & Manage Phone Calls"" Why?? So I've uninstalled and wont be installing unless they drop these permissions! And if Samsung reply saying it's nothing to be concerned about then get rid of the permissions, they're nothing for you to be concerned about! The final question I'm being asked in this review is ""Is this app good for Tracking Fitness Activities"" Well I suspect the latest update is good at Tracking Me!"
"Love the visual redesign. Need to bring back the long-term view for resting heart rate (by day, week, month, etc) vs having to scroll for each days resting rate."
"Come on, i am a developer, u don't need to make mandatory a sim card, to send notifications, and sync contacts, make it optional as you see not everybody use this app in his main phone. I can't sync my watch dataaaaaa"
"Been using it on a daily basis for a little over a month now, it has been helpful so far, with the step count, community, challenges, workouts, water intake and calories intake... what i dont get is the way it balances out the calories intakes"
"The greedy team at Samsung has decided to make the top banner of the app dedicated to advertisements for products both by Samsung and others. It is tacky and despicable for a company to provide advertisements on a $700+ phone. It is clear and painfully obvious, that your experience on your device is considered far behind to the profit that Samsung can generate from you. If you do not like ads inside your stock apps, stay. away. from Samsung."
The app shows my running pace at approx twice actual. As it shows it on both my watch and phone whilst independent and my walking pace is correct then I guess the app is faulty. I gave e mailed the developer but they have not replied. I have a reply asking me to ring a number. Is this a UK number? If it's international ......
"Ever since ther you've I can't log in It wants 2 step verification and it sends a code. But then it starts over and over. Very annoying. I just want to measure my workouts. I cleared the cache and still same problem, annoying. I don't want you doo this two step verification just log my heart rate"
The current pace while running is very inaccurate and keeps fluctuating significantly even when maintaining a steady pace.. the average pace appears to work fine. This app is good but overall frustrating due to all the issues
I like the app and it is super handy. I love that it links to my Samsung Watch. The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because it should have a period tracker as well. Like as a female this is a vital tool and part of my life. I can't fathom why there is a tracker for caffeine intake but not for something all women have to go through. I would really love to see this added to the app and watch.
"Great app but I mostly use this app for tracking calories and thats where my complaints are. I would like the app to have a feature to edit items pulled from the database if information is incorrect so I can use the correct information. Also would like it to track more nutritional information such as sugar, anf cholesterol which are asked for when creating a new food but it isn't used in the Nutrition intake summary. Add these features and I think the app would be a 5/5"
"Unfortunately, with the dropping of connectivity to 3rd party apps with the latest update, I no longer find the app to be useful. I will be looking for another step tracker that does fit my needs."
"I love the copy/paste generic responses that you give everyone who has given you guys one star. Shows how you take the time to approach everyone individually who has a legitimate concern. I have uninstalled this app. Have used this app for over 8 years. Here's a thought: Remove the option that FORCES people to allow you access AND USAGE (apps words, not mine) of the actual phone and contacts, then get back to me. This is my 2nd review since the first was deleted yesterday."
"Update: STILL can no longer choose ""watch only"" for health data. You can choose phone or ""all devices"". Whatever recent changes were made caused this. Data is now inaccurate."
"2 stars because the app is not fool proof. People are able to complete monthly challenge of 200000 steps in a day or 2, which is impossible. This is easily noticable, but still not fixed."
"*****SPYWARE ALERT***** DO NOT UPGRADE TO THE APRIL 7TH VERSION! Update is actually a downgrade. What the hell... it worked fine before. Apparently it won't work if you don't allow the app to ""make and manage phone calls"". NO app (except Phone) needs to see my contacts or use my phone. Sudden Garbage! Spyware! Uninstalled. Fix your app... the users think you suck when you're reviews are going down. And you can keep the bullsh!t canned replies."
"Samsung, please bring back oxygen saturation (SpO2) as a standalone item rather than strictly as a bundle with stress monitoring. Otherwise, this app is great for keeping track of health items. Samsung Health can save reports which can be printed or shared (e.g., with healthcare provider)."
"My issue is that I need a Samsung account to use this app. Your solution was ""make a Samsung account"". Really? How didn't I think of that?! Let's try my solution: make it possible for an app to be reverted to a previous version, remove the need for an account for this app (seriously, I need an account to know how many steps I made?!?!? Really?!?! Want to know my bank account info? Talking of needless things. Also apparently while trying to make things work Eula for Knox changed. What is knox?!"
"Really keeping my motivated. Update: Please allow us to sync with other watches/devices/apps. Just the main ones: Polar, Garmin. It really unsafe for us to walk with your phone for steps calculation. We all would love a Samsung-fitness device, firstly it is expensive as all devices are, and I can't really just throw away what I am using currently. Thank you"
"I am having very much difficulties in this new design ,. I wish app should be easy to access and understand as well not complex , hope make tutorials so very one can use it easily, I have been in using this app from last one year and it did help me with maintaining my health, let's hope for better"
Just uninstalled the app due to the new update that forces you to allow access to phone contacts. I understand there is a new feature but not everyone wants to use the new feature so it should not be a requirement of all users to give permission for the app to access phone contacts.
The new interface is terrible. I have to scroll down in order to get to the info I need or access the features I use? Is there a way to revert to the previous layout where I could see and access much more in a single screen?
"Pretty dope! Helps you track a lot of things. And as they saying goes, anything that can be measured can be improved. The steps challenges keep things interesting."
"I loved this app. I used it EVERYDAY, but now I can't even get logged in anymore. The new update messed everything up. Can you guys fix this? Or do I need to look for a new app? I don't want to leave a star rating because it was great but now I'm just annoyed that I can't use it. I have tried to set up the two step thing and still NOTHING!"
"Used to use this app all the time but will be looking for something else, as they are requiring access to my phone/ contacts which is ridiculous. I see they've commented on others' same complaint saying they won't use that info, which makes no sense. Just don't make that access a requirement."
The app is terrible. It keeps losing the ability to sync randomly without notice. Garmin connect was vastly superior. It makes me regret even buying the Samsung Galaxy 3 watch.
"I have used this app for year. Golf, walking, hiking, circuit training and others. Can't say how accurate the calories burned is. Wish there was a exercise on it for pushing a lawnmower."
I just switched to Samsung Health when I bought a Galaxy watch to replace my Fitbit. The app is definitely not as good as the Fitbit app and MyFitnessPal. They really need to add a way to scan barcodes so that you can enter your meals properly and easily. Otherwise I will be sticking with MyFitnessPal.
"So far I like this app. I am a senior person, who due to physical pain, is only able to sleep in spurts. I still try to get 7 hours each day. I am annoyed that I have to mentally add up my actual sleep time each day. Please consider giving us a total of the actual sleep time. I'm not sure how the actual sleep time is useful, since it includes awake time during our sleep. Thank you"
"Awful. forced an update on me and now won't let me use the app without giving it access to my phone to snatch personal information, and of course agreeing to an (invasion of) Privacy notice. This will be my last Samsung phone unless this problem is corrected immediately with a new update. So tired of these forced updates which either cripple a feature or invade privacy. *Response to Samsung:* I disagree, you do not need to extract my phone number as a condition for installation:Trying Google fit"
"I found this app so useful until I realized how inaccurate it is, I ran the exact same route with different Recordings every time: This is my variation in the exact same route - Elevation gain range of 10m - Total ascent range 40m - Lowest elevation range 9m - Distance 180m - Highest elevation 15m -Total descent 110m"
"edit:brought it back. ‚ô•Ô∏è got my S10 for the heart rate monitor. used every day for years. suddenly no longer works at all. I delete the app and reinstall it and the option for heart rate and stress test has been removed. this is deeply, deeply sad. idk what phone I will replace this one with, but it won't be the phone of a company who disables physical features of devices years after purchasing it. shame on you Samsung! multi billion dollar company - begging you to return heart health tracking."
Lost Data. Tracking regular exercise nicely and then 1 day of data just disappears. It was recorded the night before but lost next morning. Back to Excel it is. Why would I call a US number from Australia to fix an issue with the app?
"I'm giving this app 3 stars do to the fact that it's very good for keeping track of things. only 3 stars due to the fact that the weight management is totally off. At 1052 Am, the app already says I'm over on my caloric intake, and I've not logged a single item yet for the day. I'm always in the over category."
It used to be easy to use. Now I can't even find where to hit a button to start checking my heart rate. All the fancy stuff you added and lost easy access to basic required features.
"I usually love this app, but after the most recent update, an error message pops up and says that for security reasons, it cannot be opened on a rooted phone. The thing is, my phone is not rooted. So it sounds like a bug in the update. Please find the problem and fix it!!"
"This is great as a central ""hub"" for the various health apps I have. The only downside is that it doesn't give a ""remaining calories"" total that I can use to judge how many calories I have left for each meal. I have to get this info from my fitness Pal that I use to record food I eat"
"New update disconnected my sleeping app from Samsung Health. Can't find where to connect the apps. Although the new interface has a nice font, the old interface was easier to navigate."
Won't measure stress level anymore. It just shuts down. 3/21/20. Thank you for your reply. I did as you suggested and turned off the multiple tracking. Stress level works! Thank you. I adjusted my rating.
Terrible app. I can't even track my weight anymore because it doesn't let me add any new data
Everything works great with the latest version. The only issue I have is that there are ads at the top of the app. I have turned Marketing notices off but the ads remain. My only gripe is that I wish the ads were not there.
Since the new update my gear watch is absolutely useless. All my training was linked to runkeeper and now they removed connectivity. It's the only reason I bought the watch instead of other brand. Complained few times but no solution given. Always same stupid standard awnser like on below comments. Absolutely useless for the customer. They really want you to mov3 away from Samsung. Money is in the pocket already.
"I liked this app and use it all the time. But since the latest update, it sucks. The display has stopped showing average heart rate. I have watch4 now it takes over my heart rate and is terribly inaccurate. I'm sorry I bought the watch it's been a big disappointment."
I used to use this app but then just stopped. I re-signed in and planned on using it for the monthly step challenge because I liked it. It looks like the community comment area isn't there anymore which I enjoyed. I won't be using it because I use a Garmin smart watch which I can't connect to this app. I can't even connect the Garmin app so that the steps can be transferred. I don't have my phone on me all the time. This is useless to me now. Wish I could delete this app.
"Stand alone oxygen tracker has gone,so what was a 4* app has now become a 1*. I don't care about it being added to the stress monitor, because that takes too long and doesn't save trends. No doubt I'll just get a canned response about it being removed in version whatever, but that's an evasion - not an answer."
"It does what I need it to do, and does it well, so I'm happy with it. The sleep monitoring can get a little off at times (not actually recording my sleep), but that's somewhat understandable with me. Not real complaints."
"This app used to be so good. Intermittent step counting and losing data are now key features. I have just found out the 13,600 steps data I walked yesterday had not been recorded a along with the previous 2 days. Worthless app."
"7-Sep: And with the latest update, Health no longer pulls through BP from Health Monitor. What is it with this garbage application? It gets worse instead of better. Not only does it STILL not correctly pick up age when calculating HR zones when displaying an exercise, I now can't even force it to do so by going into my profile. Makes a HUGE difference when you're in your 60s like me. Unforgivable lack of testing. If I could give zero stars I would do so."
I enjoy this app but I find it lacking in exercises and the food amount options are limited. A good example of what I'd love to see for the food options is carb manager. Although how S.Health organize meals is better
"Last update is whack. Removed weight management feature as well as ""You vs. Age Group"" and ""You vs. All Users"" on the steps leaderboards. Otherwise was a great app that I've never had problems with."
This was a great app until the latest update. I am now regretting my decision to get a Samsung watch. I have an app that my health insurance uses to save me money. No longer works with Samsung because of the latest update. My employer is using an app for a step challenge. Doesn't work with Samsung. Not even Apple is this restrictive.
"I got this watch after going back to android from ios. I really like the app & the level of detail it gives. Such as heartrate zones and the details of those. However there needs to be more exercise categories. I work out alot using my quest , the apple watch was gr8 for that as i can log that as fitness gaming and i got to les mills classes but they are not listed i cant given log them as weight training or mix cardio. Hopefully it gets updated in the future"
"Loved it previously, but now that calories burned versus calories taken in is gone, as well as the weight management option gone, it's getting uninstalled. I told so many about this app. Now I'm looking into apps to download so I can get features I'll use. Td;lr...the update sucks."
had it for years (since I've owned Samsung phones) but it has since become buggy and will put my weight management over then limit when I havent been (just an example) tried to make it work like clearing cache but I guess I'll leave it for now!
"My Galaxy S22+ came with this app installed but I've uninstalled it as it's useless without a wearable device. The older version on my old phone allowed me to measure heart rate, stress and O2. I assume that's been removed so you'll buy a wearable device but not going to happen. I just pull out my old phone when I want those measurements."
The most recent update has been terrible. Watch is taking forever to sync. Doesn't sync steps accurately in accordance to what watch says. Many other issues with the most recent update
"I love this app, but recently it's been crashing. out of nowhere a message continuously pops up and i have to 'force stop' the app. I dont root my phones, and this has been happening ever since the last update."
"Good but some issues. I use to be able to put in how long ive walked myself but now its not allowing me to click ""save"" when entering the walk manually. Also theres alot of foods that I cant find when adding in meals."
"Stopped syncing, all exercise counts incorrect. Use to work great but now a huge problem. Considering leaving all Samsung products, been with them for years. App wrong, watch wrong, what's next the phone."
There is no reason for this application to have a access to your contacts and phone numbers. It won't let you use this application unless you agree to that. That is bull. There fore I will not use this application. If I could give zero stars or negative stars I would. Especially since before the upday you didn't have to agree to this. So sad they have ruined a good application in doing this.
"I used this app to monitor exercise along with heart before during and after exercise, measuring heart rate and stress level is no longer available using app. Truly disappointed in their tactic to get you to buy accessories to be able to fully use the app!!"
On my old phone I loved this app. I could measure everything I wanted and save it. Since I upgraded my phone it doesn't measure everything and in won't let me enter stats in manual. It I could enter. Blood O2 level and temperature in manually I would love it again. Even the blood pressure and heart rate which I can enter manually in a pain.
Was working great till a week ago and now stops recording every time the screen goes to sleep. When you wake it up it jumps to your new location and straight lines your route and distance measurements.
"Had been using this app to track my exercise, but it keeps cutting my routes short. There is no way to modify the activity to correct it when finished. Potential if it worked more consistently."
Like this app. No glitches. Would like to see more total health features added. I like that I can track women's heath. I would like to see tracking medications and bowel movements.
GPS tracking is not accurate Every time I start the tracker manually and finish the tracker. But the GPS track is not accurate. It just shows straight lines though there many turns in between.
Recent update have completely ruined this app. I read dozens and dozens of reviews all basically saying the same thing - complaining about the removal of features like calories burnt etc and all you say you realise how frustrating these changes are. So Samsung why have you done them??? Why change something that wasn't broken? When will the features return? Will the features ever return?
I love this app but since the last update there seems to be a glitch when adding food to count calories and nutrients scores. Sometimes my nutritional score is 0/100 after all my meals are entered. I hope that is fixed soon :-)
"New update won't open until I create a profile with Samsung. I just lost everything i did with this app for the past 4 years. They want your personnal data so much, that if You don't setup the account, You loose the built-in phone HR monitorThanks Samsung!!!"
"I love it! Honestly used to use the fit it interface and this Samsung health app has way more to offer for literally no cost! Ans I just there is an option to pay for more services but what's available for free is everything I use o a daily basis. I am able to track my sleep, food & water intake, join step walking competitions you name it! 1000% worth thw switch from Fitbit to Samsung heath+ Galaxy Watch Active 2."
"I really enjoying using this app to track my progress and like recording my food on here. However, I have to rely on other apps like myfitnessapp to be able to use the barcode scanner. It's a really useful function and should be added onto the app. Would be of great help to many people."
"I can't get past the 2 step verification. Add phone number, get the code and then everything is greyed out so can't move forward. But reading other reviews seems as though this is a common problem. It's a shame because I liked using the app to track my cycling, not able to do it now though."
"Hi. I noticed that oxygen level not synchronised when taken stress measure. Why? I am using Samsung Note 20Ultra. Stress checking by smart watch. Can you fix this? Thanks for answering, I see that number is like calling to US unfortunately i can't make this call. Any chance to help without calling?"
"I used this helpful application for more than 2 years because it helps me in organizing sleepingtime, sports and controlling my personal weight, but when it was last updated, unfortunately it asks me for personal data such as my phone number, and this is not going with the user‚Äôs privacy, and although I would have liked to rate it with five stars because I have always benefited from it , I gave it one star as a rating so I will not use it again and I will dispense with it ."
Requires sign in to operate and saves your data to the cloud. No option without signing in
"All in all, this is a pretty good app. The step count isn't always accurate, and sometimes even the distance isn't quite accurate, but it is a well rounded app that can keep track of everything, and challenges you to do more."
"Like the app for walking, coffee recording also like the sticker price for accomplishing more then 5000 steps. I was unable to record my sleep time. I sleep during the day. Encourage me to walk more. Also use the waitgh recording blood sugar recording and blood pressure recording. Have used the app few days only. Hope the review was useful."
"Great and very useful app. However, there isn't a dashboard that shows your step, calories burnt and distance covered at a single glance."
"Sometimes has problems reading my finger when scanning. Overall great app! Allows you to track water, caffeine and food. Offers monthly challenges, provides healthy related articles and tracks your daily activity."
"I just started using this app. The best part of the app was telling me how long I remained in each sleep cycle. Once again, Samsung you've screwed up. If I could give -5 stars I would. If its not broke, don't mess with it!! Fix it or the 1 star stays. And don't tell me to reach out to you. You reach out to me. I can still return my Galaxy watch also."
"For tracking exercises, I would like to suggest adding an option for exercise classes with an option to enter calories burned manually. For example, classes at good life could be tracked."
"The app overall was great, after the new update, Fitbit as a connected service options is now missing and remvoed. I hope the dev team would bring it back. Wish you all could add more connected services instead of Strava."
"Don't buy an S20 (any model) if you want to use this app! If I had known they didn't have SpO2/heart rate sensors I wouldn't have bought the Note S20 Ultra, and I'm not going to buy a Watch 3 just to read my oxygen saturation levels. And yes, I realize it's a hardware issue, but why hamstring your own app on a $1300 phone just to sell more watches?"
"Very inspirational and motivational. Helps my understanding of diet and motion. I highly recommend this app for anyone needing a nudge in the right direction for tracking runs, walks and calories"
"Havent been able to sync for step counting in other apps since last update. Edit: still having issues and technical support cant figure it out. Great job with those ""bug fixes""..."
"Sadly the app is devolving, more data taken while functions being removed. I wish the old version my phone shipped with was available. I wanted a samsung watch but this has me leaning towards another brand. I will not create an account to give you more of my data."
"I have been using this app for 2 years and loved it, but with the new update that will not grant access unless I agree to allow access to makes call is a deal breaker. The explanation given in the other comments is unacceptable as they advise the app will not make calls. Then why are they forcing us to accept this permission. I will be uninstalling this app and finding a new app as I do not see any reados to allow a fitness app access to my calls & contacts."
I have recently changed from a Garmin Active to Samsung Fit. The app from Garmin Active was excellent. The Samsung Health App is terrible. The number of steps between the App and the Fit varies too much. I set it to only show the Fit steps as i wear it 24 hours a day. They never match. The total calorie counter is almosy 30% less on the Fit as against my last two watches. I cannot check my total daily calories as it does not seem to be on the health app. This is the worst app.
"This used to be great, but it stops counting your steps and then starts again maybe 50 steps later. It also told me yesterday that I didn't reach my goal, 30 minutes after it said congratulations you have reached your goal for today. Not sure what happened with the update, but definetly off somewhere"
"It is a really technological tool for good health. It helped me to understand the meaning of calories in regards to the food and daily exercise. Congrats Samsung, I hope to continue to develop it addding more AI techniques to further support individuals."
"I bought the Galaxy 4 phone specifically because I need the ability to record ECGs. My watch says to use the Samsung Health Monitor app, but I cannot find how to record an ECG in this app.UPDATE: I spoke to Samsung app support & was told that the app that records ECGs is only compatible w/ Samsung phones, which I don't have. I was clear about needing ECGs when I bought the watch from T-Mobile; they sold me the watch knowing it wouldn't work."
"Excellent app for following workouts, weight changes, tracking meals. Fantastic. Also a fun way of involving the whole family in step challenges and different activities to keep everyone active."
Why has the latest update removed basic trackers? Coffee and Weight Management are nowhere to be seen now but Water is still there. Obviously attention to detail is not a mantra your developers are conscious of! App used to be good but is now useless as cannot trust that future updates will not lose other key features.
"I always loved this app and used it constantly but for some reason the recent update for my Samsung galaxy s20 fe phone has stopped this app from working. All it keeps saying is ""syncing with galaxy active2 watch, this may take some time"". I have left my phone on for more than ten minutes (meaning before the screen turns off, for days) and nothing happens! The app has become useless! Please fix this issue so I can use it again! Sincerely Jennifer Mellette"
"I enjoy the challenges but dislike the fact that 'people' manage to do impossible amounts of steps in a month to win. They must be running constantly for the whole month. Managing to do over 200,000 steps on the first day is virtually impossible. Apart from that it's fun and works well."
"Why on earth take away the weight management option? Started to use it last week and now this update took us back in time. Really? Would like to hear the excuse for this change... Can't be that difficult to bring it back, just put back what you have taken out. And must we wait for a long time for a new release?"
After last update it's extremely heavy and crashes all the time. Cannot record anything and I have to wait 5 seconds after I press something for it to respond. Too bad it was a good app but now totally useless for me (used on an A5)
Recently bought the galaxy watch and it always take a while to sync. Once it does it had good information and is very useful. Takes ages to sync to myfittnesspal and other apps like that.
Could be a great app if not for the constant barrage of ads across the top of the app. I've already bought a Samsung phone and a Samsung smartwatch. I really don't need to see ads on a stock app. It's obnoxious.
"Decent app that counts steps, I question how accurate it is because I get different readings if it's in my pocket compared to my backpack. Haven't tried any of the exercise functions. Not sure how it will keep track of meditations or yoga."
"I updated to the latest version and now it requires you to sign in with a Samsung profile, create two factor authentication, and wants access to contacts and make calls. I don't care what the developers reason is, uninstalled!"
"1 star because: there are many bugs, problems, issues can be found Samsung Community but no one cares over 2 years... Is there are anyone from Health development team here? from my side first issue is: sync with Strava sometimes takes 48 hours. The problem more than year still no one care about it. Is it so difficult just add ""manual synch"" button? And more and more problems (you can find on your own forum) Do more useful things instead of ""how to cook"" activity"
"It's great at keeping track of steps, it can track your bike route, keep track of loads of different exercises. It has logs for food, weight, water intake and more! It's great!"
"This app shows ads. Edit: The app shows promotion for Galaxy S21, which counts as an ad. I don't want to see promotion for products on my health app. I have paid a premium for the phone. Stop showimg ads to people on your default apps. Even the weather app shows ads."
Not capturing correct number of floors. I have been prefor a move and noticed the count for floors remains 1. I am on the third for and have had numerous flights. Frustrating as the version indicates current.
"Hi Team, The app is decent but the audio guide data is flawed. While running the speed she mentions is incorrect. Request you to pls get the math right and do a testing before releasing such a faulty update. Thanks"
"Problem was with my network it was set to metered, once setting was changed it worked perfectly. Works seamlessly with my Samsung Galaxy fit through the wearables app. Still a little uncertain about how the step counter works on fit and phone"
this app works great blood oxygen test is just as good as the one at the doctors office. On my bike ride it covers speed altitude an distance with split time an speed per mile. perfect for light workouts or training workouts has never let me down. an its free!!! try it you won't be unhappy
"Terrible that so many of us have the same issue. Yet shocking still is the samsung support response, essentually 'Accept the alert to grant access to your phone & contacts because we won't actually do it, wink wink!' Samsung, we paid for your watch, it wasn't shareware. We shouldn't have to trade our contacts for something we purchased..."
The update in April 2021 demands access to the phone and personal contacts. There is no way to open the app without granting this permission. I do NOT want to be part of a community and this app does NOT need access to this information. It is a violation of my privacy. I would not recommend this app. No app other than the telephone needs this access.
"The app is really good. Just awesome. But I have a problem. I want to set different targets for each day of week because I don't go running every day. For example, in Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays I want to have a 10000 steps target. In the other days of week I want to have another target. I hope you will bring this feature soon. Ugh. My English is bad, sorry about that"
"The last update wanted permission to my contacts and make phone calls. There's no reason that an app that counts my daily steps needs access to making phone calls. Lame. I uninstalled the app. Edit in response to the wacky response I received; I never imagine myself saying, I made my step goals for today, you know what would really optimize my experience? If this app had access to make phone calls from my phone. Lol. Just weird."
"Just bought a Samsung Gear fit 2. Brand new. Not used. Hunted high and low as this was the one recommend to me. App and support ing apps do not function to give proper notifications or even backup restore. Weight management gone, and because I'm in Canada no stress tracking. Complete waste. Had a Fit band 8 months and Samsung denied warranty because Amazon sold me an international model. Samsung sucks. Class action lawsuit anyone? I'm in."
"Great app till last update, now requires a phone number for ""my security"". I don't want to add a phone number to see my steps count.. Simply can't use app anymore.. Edit after Samsung's answer: I don't need guide to setup app, I don't want phone verification process, please remove phone verification so I can use app again! Thanks"
"Firstly. Why do developers get to decide on changes to an app without consulting users. Given the number of responses after losing the weight management element, consultation did not occur Second if we have to wait for ""a future update"" to fix this mistake. Perhaps it's time to look for a new app."
"Out of all of my fitness apps this is the only one that I ever have problems with and I'm using a Samsung phone. The GPS tracking very rarely works. I've been wanting to get Samsung Fitness watch oh, but I am looking at other brands because it probably wouldn't work with Samsung Fitness anyway."
Weekly average totals but not the totals completed. Once Upon a Time it gave me my weekly totals. Now I do it myself. Which is ok too. Won't allow that to me back. Totals will help me. Though it doesn't necessarily hurt me. Thanks again for all the diligent and outstanding hard work that you all do on a daily basis.
It's just ok.. please provide option to manually input workouts and calories. If I do 30 minutes of cardio and the machine tells me I burned 1000 calories the app will say 300 calories less for the same time. Option to manually input is essential!!!!
"Can't believe you removed the weight management option, we buy your expensing phones and smart watches to keep up to date and you remove the most important and basic feature in the app. I am in complete disbelief..."
This app is fantastic. Syncs with galaxy watch. Would also be great if there was an option to track medication on the app as well that syncs with the watch.
"Where is the weight management tracker?? This feature is gone since the update to 6.0. Is there a way to rollback the update?? Really don't like the new look, don't see the benefit."
"Great when Syncing - Uninstall To Fix. After an update, or when phone app won't sync w/watch, uninstall phone app. Once you reinstall and sign back into your Samsung account all your settings are restored."
"After you upgraded this app, it's prettier but way less useful. In particular, I no longer can see my weekly and monthly weight averages and it's impossible to easily look back at my weight over time. If I want to find out how much I weighed a few years ago, I have to scroll for bakc over the days for 15 minutes to get there! This change is making me look for a new weight monitoring app. Please let me know if you soon expect to return the weight history and week/monthly averages options?"
"Over it at first but, gets worse/more cumbersome each update. Weight Mgmt section was best feature (gone now) must use other apps for this. I rely/use it less now favor other apps. Helpful additions would be: Sugar intake details in daily Nutrition summary; Bar code reader for food entry; easier food item entry (was easier before); ability to enter a portion of a large homemade recipe; ability to add steps logged on Fitbit/non phone tracking devices; Compatibility with Fitbit devices and app."
"Mandatory login to Samsung Account ? you're forcing people to create accounts & share information, I don't think u should, a choice should be given as it was there before to skip login & just use the app. We paid for the sensors on this phone and should be able to use it without having to create an account, if I had the option to uninstall, I will uninstall every damn Samsung App that asks for login, I used to be a Samsung fan boy, used to. time's come to move on to a different one. DATA SELLERS"
Unfriendly to uk users S health isn't a bad fitness app however compared to fit bit it's not the best in terms of customising your options. Unlike fitbit you cant track female health and visually it's boring and bland. It only takes lb or kg weight tracking and doesn't have any info regarding food trends. If your thinking about buying a fancy smart watch buy a fit bit rather then samsung. Unless they update there app I wouldn't recomend
"Used it to track my sleep among other things, then an update a few months back made it so that my Samsung watch has to connect to my phone and use the Samsung Health app to use sleep tracking. Ugh. Fine. THEN I tried to use it today and it asked me to set up two step verification so my friends can find me and invite me to challenges. Umm no?? I have never started or want to start workout challenges with friends?? I prefer to exercise and suffer by myself. Can't opt out so I uninstalled instead"
Does not register any of my steps have been on my feet from 9am till 7PM and apparently only done just over 4000 steps when looking at data it's not even registered them. Support was contacted an age ago and they were not even slightly helpful. Loved the older version on my note 4 HATE with a passion this version!!!!!
"Have used this a lot but it's suddenly asking me to update permissions which it won't let me do nomatter what I try. Really frustrated, app now useless. Why change??? Thank you for you reply but it doesnt answer my query or solve my problem. I have tried every way to give permission but I still cannot access the app now, still says must give permission. Hopeless"
"Really enjoy it! Suggestions: 1) add bar scanner for quick food input 2) allow modification of workout details, like calories. The app never shows same calories burned as the machine used."
"I would have given this a much higher review, but after a privacy policy change, the app now requires access to view and manage phone calls. Regardless if it is or not, the optics of this aren't great. It appears to be an attempt to harvest (and monitize?) personal data of users hidden behind a generic ""better user experience"" explanation. Unless someone on the dev team can answer what exactly this permission is used for/will be used for, this app should be viewed as a privacy risk."
2/10/22 Continuous HR restored. Just need the removal of lockscreen demand & I will be able to use the ecg feature. Now 1/4/22 heart rate is no longer continuous. O2 seems to have been buried. No elevation/stairs.In order to use ecg must install app that doesn't work unless you jigger your lock screen. Pathetic. The app itself should have the password lock not the phone. Fitbit is looking more attractive. It at least has features that work & more of them.
"It's a very healthy app, but, it too has its own health problems... Hahaha.. What mean to complain is about its step counter... It perfectly records steps when walking.... But, it doesn't stop there... It counts steps even when I stop walking and drive my bike... It shows ridiculous measurements , but, can be rectified if Samsung looks into the problem..."
The app is good to track the fitness but I have problem with GPS map. I play music on Bluetooth and run.. When I finish it shows all the parameters but not the map with the track I ran. How to fix this???? I want to see the track I ran.
"I recently purchased the new Samsung Galaxy Watch because it's beautiful, I am a loyal Samsung customer, and most importantly because I would use it with my health insurance app. However, I learned afterwards that Samsung Health will no longer support 3rd party apps as of 9/1/19. I am very upset. Please let me know if this is true or not. I will need to return the watch ASAP if it is true."
"The app oversimplify data and assume they know what kind of statistics user want. Example, looking at weekly steps, I want to see the sum of all steps in the week, but all I get is average. Dude, I want to see total steps in a week, I can math that average myself! MASSIVE BATTERY DRAIN. May because I use Samsung Watch but hell, it rank top with at least 25% power usage everyday. I already restrict its background activities and startup to pull down to 15% but still the most drain."
"Super disappointed! I just ""upgraded"" to the Active2 from Fitbit. I'm on the verge of returning! Nowhere on the watch, on any widgets or anything, can I find total daily calories burned. The whole reason people buy active watches is to track their weight and activity and yet I can't see my running total calories burned throughout the day!? How am I supposed to track how many calories I have left to eat or how much little extra exercise to do if I can't even see my total burned calories that day?"
"Had been getting the ""rooted phone"" error for a few weeks but today it started popping up the notice every few seconds when I was never even attempting to open the app. uninstalled it to make it stop, isnt worth the trouble"
"Used it every day prior to recent update, I have no desire to allow a fitness app to make phone calls or have access to my contacts. Such a shame as it was a great app for tracking trends in my activity & how many of my walked miles were healthy pace. Gutted but have uninstalled it"
Samsung forced the update to me so I now have an app that is essentially useless. It appears that Samsung now actively encourages people to be unhealthy by removing features that encourages a healthy lifestyle. Ironic for an app that has Health as their name... Also it is now insisting on access to my phone book in order to use some features. Talk about being dodgy.
"Deleted the app. They now want phone camera contacts permission so I can view my steps. No thanks. maded me decided to stop buying any Samsung products. Total over reach on samsungs part. NOw that they have resppnded, I have ZERO INTEREST in participting in ""together"" (whatever that is). FIX IT SAMSUNG. FINAL EDIT: Samsung just doesn't get it. I currently have a phone, tablet, 2 sets of earbudsand and a tv from them. I will never purchase another Samsung product. Bye Samsung forever!"
Agree that the step counter is super inaccurate. Better to use pedometer
"Best health app! Update.. It is so distracting/annoying to receive summeries, updates, log a meal, sleep etc.. during a workout. I use Samsung Health on my Galaxy watch 4 classic daily and am very happy with app/watch except the distractions. Am I the only one with this issue?"
"I loved this app while I used it on my Samsung Galaxy S7 edge. However, I now have a Pixel 3a. The new phone is not sensitive to each of my steps. It's so disappointing that I'm uninstalling the app. It just doesn't work well with the Pixel 3a."
"My apps for galaxy fit 2 was working well until today. Today as I walked for 7+km, it didn't show my route & location and no heartbeat. Is there something wrong? I had my last walk on the 26/8/21 & everything was fine until this morning where I found no heartbeat in the route (map) & heartbeat. Can u let me know what went wrong? Thanks."
This app uses far too much battery and is always at the top of my battery usage list using 15-20% and means I get at least one days charge less from my phone. I'm currently uninstalling and reinstalling every time I want to synch with my watch. Such a shame as the app itself is good. I wish Samsung would sort this problem out.
Samsung Health will not accept allowed permissions. I cannot use this app? This app worked great for what I needed. Now I cannot open it because of the privacy settings. I am not give permissions to phone calls and contacts. If I control privacy why can't your app and company allow my privacy? Other apps do! Please fix this major issue.
Since the latest update. I can not open the app. keeps saying due to security measures the app can not open because the phone is rooted. my phone is not rooted...... very disappointed! I have been using the app for a long time.
"Update: you suggest to contact you within app where I only see FAQs and community messages from other members reporting same issue, no solution. Joke service! üò° Initial review: Very disappointed, shouldn't have changed from Fitbit. Many negative points, one for example is the inability to edit the sleep time whilst the wrong start and wake up times are automatically recorded. To anyone looking for a health monitor I suggest to stir away from Samsung and just get a Fitbit which is even cheaper."
Gives a pretty accurate account if my steps but struggles to pick up work outs / running even when using a smart watch. I think some peoples app may be broken as walking / doing enought steps in 1 month to walk around the world is a bit hard to believe.
It looks good but it just eats your battery. 100% battery used to last me 12 hours it's down to 3 since I installed this app. It's unusable and if you tell it not to run in background it doesn't sync right so that's hopeless as well
"Update caused issue with Galaxy watch. I have had a Galaxy watch 46mm for about a year, and was using it with this app during that period. About 3 weeks ago I woke to find my watch was dead. I charged it and within hours the battery was at 50%, I would usually see a solid 2.5 - 3 days between charges. After resetting and reinstalling everything to do with the watch, the problem persisted. I began troubleshooting. After removing S health from the phone, the battery went back to normal."
"App will not work without phone permission as described above; however, now Samsung Health requires setting up ""two-step authentication"" so that the authorized user only can access the data for example in group challenges. This is ridiculous. All we want to do is access our own step and sleep history. Will look for other apps and other non-intrusive phones to replace Samsung. Big Tech is pervasive and hypocritical."
"As of Jan 1, 2021, after many years to the contrary, Samsung Health REQUIRES you sign into your Sumsung account in order to use this app. They have posted a notice that ""From version 6.15 in Jan.21, Samsung Account will be required to use Samsung Health."" They go on to say ""You will no longer be able to use Samsung Health if you do not connect Samsung Health with Samsung Account."" This change may work for some people, but not for me. There's really only one reason they are demanding this, and that's to monetize users' data. If that's paranoid, hand me my tinfoil hat. I do NOT want my personal information stored, however safely, however anonymously, in Samsung's cloud. I don't use their cloud now for any purpose (I backup my phone locally). If Samsung puts their own agenda above my preference, so be it, but I'll make future purchases based on that knowledge. UPDATE AFTER RESPONSE FROM SAMSUNG DEVELOPER: I called Samsung App support about this right after leaving this review. The person who helped me knew less about this than I did. I stand by my review. Tell me why you REQUIRE me to log in (other than the ""benefit"" of storing my data in your cloud). What are you achieving by making us do that? I suspect it's more to your benefit than mine."
"My go to app to keep track of my health, calories, weight, heart rate etc... I must add that at times I feel that it doesn't correctly add all my steps üôÉ? Overall is a great app. I'm still getting use to all the options available. Give this app a 5 star."
"It would be nice if it can show total elevation for cycling/walking/running, not just lowest and highest elevation..if this app has this feature,it would be complete, so that i don't need strava or other health tracker app."
"Haven't even used the app and am dissatisfied by the fact that I can't even put my proper name in as your not allowed punctuation. I have an Irish name, most Irish names have apostrophes. This is just a bit annoying as so many apps etc have this feature. I would assume it's the same with hyphens so double barrel surnames would share the problem"
"In no way does access to my phone number improve performance. I won't be calling your 800 number. Post a public response as to the exact benefits to having access to my phone number and contact list will have. If not, I'll be finding a new watch and app system next upgrade season for me."
This app is encouraging and makes you want to work harder and harder. I love that I can compare my steps to other Samsung users my age and same sex. I try to push to stay even or above the usual percentage. Team up with friends in the app and walk together. It's fun and encouraging so join for free and track your workouts and steps.
"This would be a 5-star app except for the following issues. - Can't separate your step count from your phone if you have a Samsung Galaxy Watch. Other Samsung watches can be separated but not the Galaxy watch. :( The app actually shows this disclaimer. - When tagging manually run heart rates or manually run stress measurements, you cannot provide a custom tag (i.e. Working, Resting, etc.). General is too vague to be able to distinguish between work and resting (i.e watching TV, etc.) and the supplied choices are NOT always appropriate (i.e. working does not necessarily mean happy, sad, tired, etc nor does resting. Happy might be socializing with friends and Tired does not imply working). Users should be able to rename or add custom, more relevant tags to make the tagging more meaningful."
"Wrong information to users. Description says all permissions are optional. But after the latest update, app doesn't start without permission to Phone/Calls. I see developer's response in other reviews that, it is to enable some feature. Why not disable that feature if permission denied instead of stopping us from using the app completely? Anyways bye for now... Update(Reply to dev): Your Privacy Policy on site doesn't reflect the same what you quoted here. Either of these needs review."
I had this app for many many months and was rather happy with it - till xyz update . Now its wants me to create an account with password etc. Are you people for real ! It worked just fine as it was now I don't have it anymore ! Sometimes it is better to leave it as it is . I would like to have the old one back . Hope you're read this . Ciao BB
"No to 2FA Two factor authentication sending text messages to the same mobile you are using anyway is ridiculous! Remove this ""security feature"". The World has gone crazy. We should be given the informed choice and accept the consequences of not using 2FA instead of being forced to by Auntie Samsung knows best! Other users, for the time being you can uninstall the latest version and install the previous APK your data will resync."
"I got a Samsung Active watch for my birthday. I've been trying to connect my watch to Samsung Health App and once I sign in, the app does not work (it keeps circling). I've re-installed the app about 5 times and still same issue. Frustrating!!"
since updating and running this app under Android 9 (beta then full release) then my weekly summaries have stopped being calculated and shown. last one that shows is November 2018. Any ideas how to restart these or is it a failed feature now
I have never written a review before but I'm so disappointed to see the oxygen sensor removed that I feel the need to write one. Could you please tell us why this decision was made? I'll give this a month then I'll be uninstalling this app unless it comes back. I have asthma and I used this feature frequently and do feel it was accurate. I see no other reason to use this app now. Stress tracker does NOT appear in my app in Canada. So I stand by my review. Not helpful.
"üòµThe app gives always notification that the app doesnt work, i have this problem for a very long long time and it interferes with other activities because the notification keeps popping up on the screen."
"View your step count in Samsung Health...""Note: Some devices, such as the Galaxy Watch Active, Galaxy Watch Active 2, and Gear S3 cannot be viewed individually."" So my new Active 2 will never show step data in the app? That is unbelievable. Update: My motion trainer workouts are recording 500 steps per mile when they used to record 1300 per mile. Why?üòë"
"Fantastic app me and my wife started in October to use it with my gear sport and her gear fit 2. We absolutely love it. We are averaging over 500000 steps per month on our farm. Our fitness are improving by the day thanks Samsung. If possible can you give all the totals as per month ie steps, kilometers walked, etc in one place as per the weekly summary. Would have been nice if data could have been analysed on a laptop"
The internet term basic comes to mind. It's design is uninspiring and I already have three other apps I much prefer. Realising I was permitted to uninstall I did so immediately. Edit - Thank you responding to my review but I think your response may be indicative of the issues I have. I am not a US citizen. This call would be very expensive for me and seems a little unnecssary for a Skype call. Also my app operates fine. I have issues with how it is designed.
"I love this app, I purchased the Galaxy watch, it was very helpful but yesterday the app was saying that I burned over 11,000 calories halfway thru the day and my workout regimen was the same, tried shutting off both and rebooting but calories burned didn't change."
"Difficult to change goals, step count is inacurrate, got rid of bpm, oxygen ect, my account didnt transfer data from my old phone to this one, all of these changes are terrible imo. Very limited app."
"I really like the interface of this app, but find it a little incomplete. It would be cool if there was a tracker for meditation and if the food tracker showed more information such as sugar intake vitamin/mineral intake."
"I'm not interested in two-step authentication in order to just check how many steps I walked or what my pulse rate is. You rendered the app useless, and in bricking the pulse oximeter removed the only reason I stuck with the Samsung product it's installed on. Follow up: The fact that Samsung's response to my criticism of 2FA is to talk about permissions which I haven't mentioned at all demonstrates that they're just not listening."
"Privacy violation, requires Samsung account now. Some people are Ok to expose personal data, some not. The point is that collected data is highly sensitive like medical records. Any data breach or leak can be very harmful for users in many ways, potentially affecting insurance premium. Users should not be forced to create account and expose personal sensitive data. It should be user choice to go with account creation or without it. If this is a sign of new company policy enforcing accounts on Samsung phones then it might affect Samsung business as some people will consider switching to other phones because of this policy."
This was great app!!! It really helped me keep track of so many things. And my weight actually went down. It kept me honest with my sleep schedule and pre loaded foods were great and made a huge differance.
I have a Google Pixel 4XL. I just purchased the Samsung Active 2 smartwatch. I cannot get into the Samsung Health app it just spins and spins. Any suggestions? I have tried everything and nothing works. I even called customer service and they could not help.
There is not a stress tracker in the app on my phone to use the pulse ox! I have literally been trying for most of the day to figure this out. I am not able to even take my blood pressure by using the sensor on my phone anymore. It only allows me to enter it manually. What are you guys doing to this app? Not everyone is tech savvy. This is the most difficult thing I have ever had to do. You know where it is because you put it there. I am so frustrated. Arrgghhhhhh!!!!
"I don't like the new update, it's horrible for me. please I want the old desing or just do your best and give it a good desing because this redesing it is too simple. try to do it more colorful and better with some old features."
"The app just all of a sudden stopped syncing my steps, and I've taken the necessary measures that it suggested to fix the problem and it still doesn't work. i had almost 13,000 steps on my Samsung Health device and now they're gone."
"I really enjoy the app but some days it won't record steps. No settings changed on my phone or app, and app is up to date. Just works some days and some days it doesn't. Let me know if you have a solution!"
"To many people complete the challenge within days of it going live. Having just review the challenge for this month,i see 18 people have completed the challenge already, that's impossible and is clearly cheating, nothing has been done since the last time i mentioned"
"This  used to be my favorite app of its type. But every time Samsung updates it  they somehow manage to make it  worse. The February 20, 2019 update is no exception. The changes made seem designed to make the app hard to use because they serve no other purpose. One more s*&t update and I'm going  to uninstall it."
Super easy to use. Love the calorie tracker. Best one I've used so far. Also really enjoy the variety of workouts you can record. Just wish SUP was included.
I would absolutely love the app with the Sep. 2020 update except MHR is wrong to the point of absurdity. This makes Vo2 max calculation useless. This makes heart rate zone training stats useless. My samsung galaxy active2 measured my HR significantly higher than the MHR the app uses for calculations. The app will not use the higher number in data *already in the app*. There is no way to enter it manually.
I can't even open the app because it gives me an error while trying to set up 2FA.
"What happen! Why can't you just leave well enough alone. I loved this app and used it just about everyday. Now with this new update, I can't even access the app due an error. If it ain't broke, dont fix it. Maybe you'll should keep that in mind, because now you have broken app that once worked for many ppl."
No longer usable without phone access permission. Invasive as heck. Just dont do it. To developer.. should have given us the option to chose to not be inclusive and still use what we had. Cannot even get into the app without the phone and camera permitted. So your after the fact reply does not help us.
"Used to have blood oxygen monitor, however samsung removed it from Canadian phones. So many people need an oxygen monitor during the pandemic, and Samsung's response to this need is to remove the function from the app. Extremely dissapointed. Editing to add the following in response to Samsung's response - If you read my initial comments, I have stated this is an issue for users in Canada. You have directed me to use a ""stress tracker"", that is also unavailable to Canadians, as a workaround."
"Used to enjoy using this app. After the recent privacy policy update and the new phone permissions requirement I will be uninstalling this app. You didn't need phone access before so my guess is that you want to grab the device's IMEI to create a unique identifier for the user's Samsung health profile to use for better data tracking and ""sharing"" with 3rd parties. Health related data should NEVER be shared to anyone. Major privacy issue."
It doesn't sync with my Health 365 app even though I uninstall so many times.Its so frustrating
"I thought that using the challenges would be a fun way to motivate me to doing more... but it is simply annoying. The top users all log something like 100 thousand steps A DAY! There is no way I or most others can even hope to compete with that. How can anyone do that many steps in a day... even if they are running... legitimately and still sleep, go to work and much less function each day?"
"I've been using this app for 5 years now, originally with my S5, then I had to enable syncinging to get it into an S9. I only have 1 request, the ability to enter in body temperature; manually would be fine."
"Downloaded this app onto my phone as I have the previous version on my old phone, but was dissapointed to see that there was no heart rate measure, or stress measure, which has a oxygen measure with it. Really is a step back than one forward. Uninstalled it."
Works quite well. Only it now stopped recording my sleep. So I started entering it in manually. Then it recorded automatically for 3 days and then stopped again. Very aggravating.
I'm not happy that they've removed the ability to view weekly and monthly graphs. The daily graphs remain but it's harder to view changes over long periods of time with these.
"As of august 20th it tracks only a tenth of the steps I make in a day. Tried clearing cache, data, tried reinstalling. Nothing worked. I have other fitness apps on the same phone that show the correct amount of steps so Samsung Health is useless to me now."
"I have a samsung s8 and it keeps looping the two step verification screen. Even after I insert the phone number and code received, it takes me back to fill in the same data. I can't use the app because of this"
"So this is now zero stars. Hey Samsung you know what would be optimal, a health tracking app that actually had health tracking options and was not reliant on the use of a half arsed fitness watch, especially with your top of line phones. Also an app that DOES NOT DEMAND ACCESS to my data to enact a function I have need or want to use. You do not decide how I use my apps, you provide the products that I wish to use such that I keep spending money on your products rather then buying another brand."
Qradio BP doesn't sync anymore like it used to. Compact view is gone. Scroll bars for entering readings worked better than the rolling wheel for dialing in numbers. Please roll back to previous method.
"On the update, it removed being able to get more programs, plus removed oxygen saturation, why? Update-- an O2 check is not the same as a stress test. I know, because I have health issues, and my husband also has heart issues. The doctor even said that removing it, was a mistake."
"I mainly used this for oxygen saturaton. It's no longer an option to measure it. üò¢ Maybe it's for liability reasons.... I don't know. If so, I understand, but then it needs to just be removed from the screen instead of just sitting there with numbers from a year ago and NO explanation."
You forgot to show in all the example pictures of the ads that are in this app. You replied telling me that there aren't any ads but there definitely are at the very top.
I use this app for the daily tracking connected to my Galaxy Watch 4. That is the core reason I use the watch and the app. The latest update to this app has for some reason removed data from my daily totals for days in November. This app desperately needs the ability to add activities back that will then add to the metrics being tracked. Otherwise what is the point? Will every subsequent app update modify my data more?
"For lack of worse rating, giving a one star. Extremely poor app. Data is not getting synced. Unable to login after changing password. Tried multiple times for many days. Just not worth the time anymore. Uninstalled the app. Would never reinstall the app."
"Why doesn't the app on the phone record floors steps or allow me to record exercise under ""other workout""?...certain workout aren't under activities so I thought the ""other workout"" section would allow me to record my progress but it doesn't work...fix this so people using a phone and don't have watch can use it too"
The AIA Silver Vitality is no longer linked here. What happened? Been trying to open it but it just opens for a few seconds then crashes. I checked the data permission in this app then found out that it's not linked. Guess I'll be using another app. So disappointed.
For a few weeks sometimes the app open but mostly it would not open. Now it opens but it says that there is no device connected to it. All these problems started after updating the app.
I find this app disappointing. I have bought a galaxy watch to replace my fitbit. I also use myfitnesspal to record my calorie intake and the Samsung DB for food is not nearly as comprehensive as myfitnesspal. The problem I have is the Samsung health app does not integrate that well with myfitnesspal. The main reason I use this is weight loss and the matching calorie with exercise is important to me. Didn't have these issue with my fitbit
"WOW..... so many negative reviews since latest update, with nothing but generic responses. I too cannot get past the 'permission' issue that others are experiencing and I too thought it was great for tracking my daily exercise. Oh well, got no time for #appcrap, easier just to uninstall & find another."
"the functionality is fine and overall it works well, but it drains my battery like crazy. my phone is literally dead in half a day with minimal use, vs heavy usage and making it an entire day without the app installed."
"What's happened to the weekly summary? Reduced from a detailed, well laid out summary to a few lines showing my weight over the week.... I use it with Samsung gear watch which integrates pretty well but one problem I've noted and Samsung seem unable to explain is that when working out I can sit and read a book or run/cycle/row 10k and the calories burned remain the same regardless of my pulse during the routine."
"Why doesn't this app track sleep cycles? I have Samsung Galaxy watch 4, and that's the only reason I use this app, but I can't find the simplest sleep cycles feature on the app. How come? UPD: Turns out the sleep cycles are not shown for every night. Why? - No idea. I still have trouble understanding why designers tend to hide elements that show no data. The user may be looking for them."
"After my mobile crashed and I got it serviced/ repaired, the app does not open. It says "" App does not support rooted device"" and it closes thereafter. Other mobile apps are running successfully. Get this thing rectified ASAP."
It stopped working..after the update..it asked for a two way authentication process..I entered the code but it's not opening after that also ..pls chk I uninstalled it and again installed it but still it's not going past the two way authentication. I used this app daily...now I think I hv use some other app for my workouts. Today I again tried u install it again but it was futile..the same thing happening again. Pls look in to it
"Pixel 6, Android 12 latest Galaxy Wearable and Samsung Health Monitor, but no ECG as advertised! This was main reason I purchased this watch. Customer Support was no help, wanted me to return watch for repairs. This is not a hardware issue, returning watch won't solve issue, the software is lacking advertised function! UPDATE: After calling, I'm informed that ECG works only with Samsung phones! Nowhere is this mentioned in their marketing literature!!! I'll not purchase another Samsung product."
"BE AWARE The app have deleted the ways to track your calories on the last update, now there is no way of keeping track of income/outcome calories per day, making the app absolutely useless, they have actually removed the best thing it had. I strongly recommend not to use Samsung products for exercise."
Galaxy wearable app constantly reminds you to install this app and your watch will constanty remind you to install this app over and over again. There is no way to turn this notification off. Its annoying and this will be my last samsung watch. I am forced to install this app if I want the notifications to stop.
"Look like the ads were removed, but the weekly sumary stopped on September 25. After I wrote my previous review on October 9, I've miraculously got Oct 3-9, 2021 summary, √≠ ·∫π, September 26-oct 2 are still missing not showing up in the app. Then now I don't have Oct 10-16 summary. Maybe there is a need to write a review every week if you need to see your summary."
"A great app, indeed. I use it to keep track of my exercises and food intake. I just wish I could choose how many ml each glass of water has, it would be extremely more convenient for me and other users, I believe. There's only the 250 ml option, but the glass I use to drink water has 400 ml."
"New update is disappointing. Why would you remove the grams of macronutrients? Thanks for the % where I need to back calculate the g to stay on track. Pointless and frustrating update. Edit - reduced to 1 star. The more I navigate this update, the less user friendly and awful the experience. Deleting this app"
"pathetic... the new update broke it. first of all, i cant comprehend why a company like samsung dosent give compatibility with Google fit and Google accounts. as a workaround, i used healthsync to get the data to google fit. now with this new update, that is broken. to top it all, when i try to create a Samsung account, i get a page in some other language. really bad for a global leader like Samsung"
"I've just qualified as a Nutrition Adviser & P.T.. I have a galaxy watch, but wanted to see how my everyday, good eating habits, were broken down. This does this simply for me. Offers me good feedback and works in line with GB recommendations. Well done Samsung. Very interesting outcome."
This app is not at all accurate. I have completely 2 different readings at different times for the same distant on the same course. Not accurate in measuring distance or calories burned.
this app is useful as it tracks and update you on the progress by km. however it has tendency to error. my recent experiences showed the app to err in recording the distance by approximately 300m. i won't rely on its computation
I've been using the app for sleep monitoring since like November last year. ..mostly to get mom to stop complaining I'm not sleeping enough. I really like the app but it's annoying that if I have active hours like 2-8 am and I sleep midnight to 7 am it says i didn't wake up on time even though it's an hour earlier than wake up target and it's not consistent even if I did that multiple days in a row :/
"Horrible app, unusable for professionals. Workouts pause for no reason (auto pause is already off), gps tracking works sometimes, step counter loves to add or remove a few thousand steps etc. Samsung watches are also horrible for the same reasons."
I liked using the Health app to log my workouts since I can't wear fitness watches. I also appreciated that the app was interactive without being overly invasive. Did an update over the weekend and now the app won't even open unless I enable the phone permission. Why would that be necessary? I'm disappointed.
Just so frustrated when they removed the weight management section at the last update of Aug 5th which helped me tremendously. Please reconsider. Update: I give 1 star now for app started yo freeze and doesn't count sleep. Update 03/07/2021: I kind of agree with everyone says each new update is horrible. I just lost my custom foods I used to enter and can't find them any more.
The app is not counting all my steps. I have removed tha app and reinstalled it. Since I updated my phone from samsung s10 to samsung s22 nothing but problems. The operation system needs to be updated to match the updated phones.
I have enjoyed the app for last 3 to 4 years but recently after the latest update the app just got stuck at the two step verification. I tried both text message verification and call verification but it's not working even after entering correct code everytime.
"After the update I can not find the oxygen meter. Where can I find it??? I called the customer service and they told me the option isn't available anymore. Strange thing, the phone has the sensor, but no option to use it. Update : I am in "" some countries"" where the spo2 meter is not provided."
"app recently updated so it is now an aggressive personal data gathering tool - why on earth does it need my personal phone number to allow me to use the app? how does samsung having my number help with my sleep pattern tracking? UPDATE 14.06.22 typical copy/paste attempt at justification. The simple fact of the matter is this app will not work without granting access to my number, the original version did not need it so why does this. My number is private and will stay that way. Uninstalled"
My app has stopped tracking location/distance when I choose cycling (it does it automatically when I walk and location permission is on) I have cleared cache etc but wary of uninstalling as I don't want to lose data. I've always found it very easy & useful until now. Any tips?
"Keeps me motivated and excited, love how it makes it easy for me to see and track my goal, it's a great hub for all my active needs. This app won't do everything but it does great in the pedometer and tracking department"
"I have been an iphone user for some time,and came back to Samsung phone two weeks ago.Bought A73 and have a samsung watch SM-R810. I am surprised, there's no blood oxygen measuring option on this Galaxy A73 phone and on my smartwatch3 the option is greyed out. Very poor. Iphone watch 6 had everything in place,without any glitches. I regret giving up on it and moving back to Samsung product."
"This is a useful app specially if you also have the samsung watch. Can you please add more workouts. It would be great for the watch to be able to monitor also jump rope workouts (count the reps, notify on duration, calories etc)"
I don't understand how this app works when it wants to. Constantly having issues with it connecting to my Galaxy fit. My step totals are always off. I have to keep uninstalling and reinstalling the app.
Just because I don't have a Samsung phone I don't get to use the features that I thought I was getting when I bought the watch? No ecg? No potential blood pressure monitor. And half my phone notifications don't even show up. I just spent over $400 on this galaxy watch 4. This might be my last Samsung product ever. Trying to copy Apple way too much.
"I'm enjoying the monthly walking challenges, although I'm pretty sure the winners have gamed the system-not too many people walk 90,000 steps a day! I wish there was a better way to communicate with others using the ap."
"I dont know if it is the App or my Galaxy Watch but according to the data I have narcolepsy. Whilst I was using the phone to ask for help via Samsung Members this morning, it has decided that I was doing this in my sleep. At least there is an ability to delete these random naps now we need a feature to edit the times delivered by the watch."
"I've been using a Fitbit until now and loved their app but really wanted a smartwatch with everything in one place. That said, I'm not a fan of this app, and even less of a fan of Samsung's inability to properly acknowledge people's concerns in these reviews. Stock response after stock response and very few actually acknowledge or address the points in the review. It's like they're not even bothering to read the content of the review and are just picking up key words...are they bots?"
"This is a helpful app but measure multiple crashes after the latest update. I have tried to reinstall it but it did not help. Moreover the sensor stays active after the crash. Any idea? ______________________________ Update. I have installed today a version 6.9.1.017. The error is fixed, the oxygen sensor is back. I change back from 1 star to 5 ones. Thank you!"
"Removal of the weekly/monthly trends was a huge downgrade. I effectively cannot use the app in my workflow anymore. Update 5/29: This feature has returned. However, I remain concerned with its removal in the first place, and hope it does not happen again."
Uninstalled as wanted a load of permissions for things (including making and managing phone calls - why?). Then wanted me to set up a two step verification thing in order to access it - up until thus recent update it was a really good and useful app!
"I want a help regarding serious problem with my Galaxy S8. Whenever I open samsung health app it says- ""because of new security policy samsung health can't be open on rooted device"". However, i havn't rooted my phone even a single time. Yesterday it was working very well, but all of sudden it started showing this error. Please tell me whats the problem a lot many people are facing the same problem."
"It was working great until I just did a recommended update and then things went down hill immediately. When I got my galaxy 4 watch I was disappointed that it didn't have the blood pressure or ECG components but was told by the sales person that it had to be approved, 6/12/21 now it's on my watch and with a Samsung app on my phone so very happy with it‚ÄºÔ∏èüëèüëçüôè"
Recently this app is shutting down during a workout before its over. I dont know it has turned off until I check my status. A recent hike it turned off 3 different times. Very annoying.
"When it works it's good, updates wipe it out. I've had to reinstall the whole process(wearable app, plugins and the health app) every time there is a watch update. I'm getting tired of the upkeep."
"I do not think we should be required to let you into our contacts, files, etc. That has nothing to do with this app. Samsung is fast pushing me to stop buying your devices, we have, televisions, phones, tablets, etc. But you are quickly moving your way out of our household!"
"Great, except you have to keep the phone on you throughout the day to have accurate stats and this is not always possible at work. I would love to be able to sync with my Fitbit."
"I've been using this app as a default with my Samsung watch for ovef a year now. I'd like to see a better range of exercises tracking options like HIIT, weight training, core workout etc the only option for all of these is ""other"""
"So I switched from Fitbit to the Galaxy Watch that pairs with Samsung Health..... only to be bombarded with Ads... Really? You need to get rid of the Ads that scroll across the top of the screen, and stop pretending they don't exist. Between my Note 10+ and the Galaxy Wear Active 2, surely you've been compensated enough. Missing my Fitbit already."
"On my previous phone a Ssmsung Galaxy s6 I had this app and I loved it. I have severe tachycardia and anxiety and it helped alot with the heart rate and stress monitor. I was able to keep up with my bouts of sudden tachycardia qnd anxiety attacks. I was forced to get a new phone and now I no longer have the things I need in this app. I can't afford a second device, I was only able to get this new phone because I had insurance on my old phone. Sooo disappointed...."
"I give ZERO stars, but it won't let me. I can't use the app without giving access to my phone. This is ridiculous. And don't give me the ""this will provide a better experience"" bs canned response. No, it won't. The previous experience was just fine. I want the app to work, and simply, as it did before. I'll find one that does what I need."
"This app is made dumber in recent updates.. When I am wearing a wearable activity tracker why on earth this app tracks steps using my mobile phone!!? It thinks I walked 6000 steps when I was cycling.. It can't show steps from wearables alone, even with their latest active watch.. Edit - I am not using a Samsung phone, I have to use this app due to Gear S3, Galaxy Active wearables. Both of them are capable of tracking steps. I don't see any pedometer option nor do I have any option to pause."
"Absolute garbage! Forced to use 2 factor, presumably so I'm forced to share me phone number only to be spammed. 2 factor doesn't work it won't accept the code. No more Samsung watches or hardware for me so I don't have to deal with garbage apps."
"Decent, but not great. The exercise list is missing so many types of activities and the app doesn't give that much data about other activities besides walking/running etc."
"What's the point if it doesn't even allow you to put in your own stride length? I like tracking my runs, but they must have their app programmed for someone half my size. My 1.5 mile runs are always calculated at around 1-1.2. The only saving grace is that I like the heart rate and sleep trackers."
After Android 10 upgrade app doesn't work properly. The steps calculation hangs after some time and you need to restart the phone to get it functional again. This is happening again and again.
I have been teetering with the use of Samsung Health for about a year (mostly streaching). I always felt good after a workout despite the suffering along with it. Finally dedicated myself to routine workouts for 1 month. I have lost 12 lbs and feeling g great. Going to continue and looking for more variety of workouts. It done me right‚úÖ .
This is a great app for those who like being fit and to keep track of how active you really are in this fast paced world we live in. It's excellent for keeping you up to date in all the activities the you do during a walk and run and cycling and the challenges are there to show you that your just as active as everybody else who has a busy life and also shows you when your having a easy day than the rest with or without a Samsung watch it still is great.
"last update messed up a lot of things. app hangs and stalls now, there is no auto-fill calories, the recommended numbers dont show. go back plz update: the app has gottenworse, it stopped tracking my 3hour walk 45 minutes into it, if anyone knows of a working food/step/exercise tracker plz let me know."
"My disappointment with this app is that i can't use it on my galaxy note 8. Each time i tried to open it a pop up tells me ""due to security stuff S Health cannot open on my device"". i just don't know how else i can use the app and my phone is not rooted. My galaxy watch is now useless since i can't use the S Health. It's annoying, so annoying."
I have been using this app for over a year and really enjoy it but sometimes it doesn't always sync accurately with my galaxy smartwatch hence the four stars. Still a great way of tracking my daily steps.
"Hate the new changes! Used to be able to easily look at average weight and steps by day, week, and month. New format is just annoying, and less informative."
"I updated the app today and when I tried to open it, it couldn't be opened , and this message (an unknown error has occurred 0√ó0B) appeared. I have tried a hundred times to open it but couldn't operate Can you please solve this problem . I have agreed to needed permissions and gave it the priority to appeare on top of other apps with no avail"
App gets worse with every new update or new phone upgrade. My active 2 watch is no longer able to track my sleep on my newly upgraded s22 plus. It was one of the few features I liked that worked great on my galaxy s9. So disappointing.
"Stops counting steps once you connect to the internet. Stop collecting data. Automatic sleep recording made me uninstall it. Not only is it arrogant to assume that you know exact time I fall asleep and wake, it is obnoxious to overwrite MY MANUAL RECORDING from your useless algorithm."
"Just uninstalled. There is NO reason this app needs access to my phone calls. Also, two factor authentification should be OPTIONAL, not forced. In order to hack the app, someone would need access to my phone, which has access to texts and email. So the unnecessary forced authentication is pointless. I liked this app and now I hate it. Good job ruining it"
"i have a galaxy note 8 ,ordered from Amazon in the Month of jan2019. recently i have been getting error messages saying ""for security reason Samsung health cannot be opened on a rooted phone"". just to clarify, this is a brand new phone which is not rooted. please fix this issue as i am not able to use the phone due to continued pop up error message"
Update: Wish it kept track of pregnancy Like the app... wish it was compatible with Fitbit interface. Also the motion detection is a bit wonky sometimes it tracks perfectly others it doesn't keep up.
"I'm sure that Samsung knows better than all the people that hate what they have done to this app, but for me, the ""optimal experience"" was the way it worked before they ruined it. Nevertheless, I will undoubtedly feel better when Samsung gives me a form reply apologizing for me not appreciating the ""optimal experience"". I wish I could delete the app, but since that is not allowed, I will just ignore it."
"Very unhappy, since the new update I am being forced to sync contacts. I do not intend on using the together feature which should be made optional. And you never needed my unique phone identifyer for the app to run before so why the snooping now. To have my camera permission needed also? well why? I dont want to take video selfies while Im working out. I have loved the app previously. I have just uninstalled. Shame on you Samsung you have let us down."
"Update- I cannot call the number you provide as its not a UK number, samsung have been aware of these issues for a very long time from digging around, its on the Samsung forum! I've actually ordered a fitbit, ill use the galaxy watch for accessories only... such a shame! But as a massive fitness lover, I need a gadget that records the right calories burned etc ..."
Love it!! Helps you and encourages you to stay fit.. Only- if you move to fast (walk super fast) step counting will be inaccurate... less then during slow walk ( the same distance... ) that's should be improved üòé
"I have walked the same EXACT route for 7 days. First day recorded 3.79 miles, yesterday (SAME route), 3.0 miles. Each day has shown less mileage walked. Today, same route 3.12 miles but shows less calories burned than 3.0 miles. I just don't see how it can be so different day to day with my doing the same routine. Frustrating..."
"I used other health apps and find this app the best that fit my needs. It has all the measurements that am interest to keep track and accurate as well. Unfortunately, just received a notification that the app developer will no longer supporting my installed app at the end of April 2019 if my/your OS is Android 5 and older-SAD! Regardless, will continue using this health app!"
I wonder why Samsung got rid of the most useful feature in the app weight management in the most recent update. Now it is just a step counter. That's one reason I was in the Samsung ecosystem. Now I'm no longer considering purchasing another Samsung phone due to this unless Samsung can give a reason.
"I think this app has a problem lately with the amount of nutrition information of the food. How come 450 gr of fruit smoothie contains 119 carbs and basmati rice has a lot more carbs than normal white rice?? When I do research, many foods in this app doesn't have accurate nutrition information amount. It makes all my diet messed up and I have to calculate it manually from another app and sources. Also this app couldn't let you to set up your own protein and fat target."
"It's a great app, but it would be nice if it let you sync devices other than Galaxy or Samsung devices. I would use the app a lot more if I could sync data from my Foss watch/Google Fit app."
I have had a few problems with this app counting steps seems to be a common one. I have installed it again hope that works. Blood pressure seems a bit up and down with other devices.
"App works fine and serves its purpose. However, there is no widget which shows summary of daily, monthly yearly activities like that of Adidas Running app. This widget inspires us to üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è run more and more and essential for an inspiration in the morning. Please provide a similar summary widget for this app like Adidas running. Right now we get a simple widget showing step count on the homescreen. This widget can be replaced with Summary dashboard widget like that of Adidas Running app. üôè üôè"
"App became utter cr..p recently. It just can't track H anymore. If your HR is higher than 120, that's it, go home. I don't know if it's a firmware update problem or an app, I don't care really. The one thing I can say, I'm really sorry to have bought this samsung s10. It su..cks biiiiig time. Contact you? To waste more time? Ah, I know, you're going to instruct me how to properly place my finger on the sensor, eh? Better invest in proper QA testing, prior publishing a shi..y app, and ruining all"
This used to be a good ap. Really loved the numeric percentages they used before. Now its a splash of lime green colors scattered incoherently accrosed the screen. I wish there was an option to keep the older display.
Why don't you guys explain what the optimal experience is. If the fitness bands were free I couldn't object to the data mining. The problem is we pay for the fitness bands. Did you guys even read what I posted? That had to be an automated reply. Once again. Explain what optimal experience means. Google type spyware.
"This was a fantastic app which I used daily but after the latest update I will not be using again. Why would you need access to my calls, contacts, files, etc? There is no need for these recent permissions. Please remove these permissions so we can return to using your app with trust."
"Was fantastic until recent update hid macros/micros, mashed together all snacks and meals, used tiny and totally useless macro/micro status bars without specific numbers and changed history style in activities and steps. Did people really ask for these changes? I find that very hard to believe."
"I love the watch but hate the app. Nothing is customizable and is based on their algorithms. I had an RMR test done and Samsung's estimate is about 300 calories lower than my RMR. I should be able to input this as well as my calorie target. I wanted the watch and app to help me keep track of my goals, not give me a bad estimation of what I should do."
"Samsung health is a great app and it helped me track many things. I have recently gotten a new phone that is not a Samsung, but I would still like to use the Samsung health app. I logged into my account, but the data from after January 2021 is not there. Can someone help me get all my data back, or is it even possible?"
"I wish the app would be able to detect when I jump rope. It's a big part of CrossFit workouts, and with a Galaxy Active 2 on my wrist, it would give me really useful data."
"The app is great to track your steps and activities like walking, running and other workouts like squats etc. The app allows you to track your water intake, menstrual cycle, weight, food and calorie intake. It also offers challenges that you can do with people around the world or with your friends."
"works well on phone, just a shame the integration with Strava is so temperamental. it used to automatically upload to strava, but doesn't anymore. Considering Strava is the largest workout online platform, samsung should make it a priority tbh"
Earlier I used to add workout and I'd get reminder notifications for the particular day. Now there are no more reminders and some workouts days are missed consequently. Please revert back to old setting and send push reminder notifications for the particular day's workout schedule.
"Must admit that I'm kinda of samsung fan - using their smartphones even after Wave 2 (who remember - understands). But you can't convince me that it's not all about marketing - camera, contacts, files permissions - really? I overpaid for samsung to avoid this kind of **it! This is the last straw, better would buy apple or pixel, etc. P.S. The most amazing part - using it with Galaxy watch, so I can see my activity on the phone widget, and on watches but can't open app for statistics and tuning))"
"I think Fitbit has a much better app, but Samsung Health is still decent. Samsung really needs to improve its social network in the app like Fitbit that will allow you to pull profiles and friend people that like your posts. also, why in the world is there no total calorie count for the day up front. I can't find it anywhere."
"This app needs to be more user friendly! I use a walker, and lay my phone down on the seat while walking, but the app doesn't recognize the movement. Samsung Health needs to be able to connect to Google Fit. That app reads all my steps."
Idk why there are so many Karen reviews for this app lol. It's perfectly fine. It works great on my super cheap metro pcs android phone for petes sake. It counts my steps all day and I've synced it with my scale from Amazon. I record all my food on it for the day and I love that. Literally zero problems ü§£
"I've been using this app for years, along with samsung watch and phone. I recently dumped the phone for a Motorola, and will be dumping my watch and app for something else, due to the fact that you have taken features away with updates, such as weight management! So long Samsung! EDITED TO REPLY: When a customer says they have dumped your products and intend on dumping your app for another app, your company looks apathetic and ridiculous telling the customer to make sure they have all updates."
This program helps me keep on track and is comprehensive enough to satisfy most people's needs. The interface is simple to navigate and customize - not to much unwanted clutter.
"Locks out past users. I've used this app since my Samsung S8+, today it asked permission to make phone calls and go into my contacts. When I refused, it locked me out of all the details I had logged in. I can't use the app unless I agree to the stupid demands of new unprivacy contracts. Thanks for taking my tracked information of 4 years and locking me out. Dumb. And unforgivable."
Very disappointed that the weight management feature is gone. Ridiculous that they removed it. That was one of the main reasons I used the app. Maybe I will just switch to fit bit.
"No, you don't need access to calls period. Stop saying it's to ""implement optimal user experience"" or what not. Ask for the permission as close to me trying to use the feature that requires it as possible. You simply do not need it to be able to record my workouts. Even the 2FA which is supposed to be to increase security - you force to use it and ask for phone number, altho SMS based 2FA is almost as insecure as not having 2FA... Just to collect as much data as possible."
"This was a great app until they updated it and wanted access to my phone calls. That's a hard pass for me. Save your response Samsung, I don't trust your ""we won't do anything bad with your info"" comment that I am seeing on almost every 1 star review. This has me rethinking Samsung products all together."
"The oxygen sat on my new Galaxy s10+ using Samsung Health app is reading approximately 6 - 10 points low compared with my previous Galaxy s8. It is also 6 - 10 points low compared to my dedicated pulse oximeter. Can you tell me how to fix this problem please. I have power cycled the phone several times. Deleted and pre-installed the app. Checked for updates, deleted the cache and data. I have checked a different S10+ and it has the same problem"
"Had been loving this app for the weight management feature but it has recently been removed ,please reinstate ASAP. Unable to enter in exercise manually for the day in the future, please change. Also please add HITT workouts to the list of exercises to choose from as it is very common these days and should be on there. If the weight management part is not broght back I may delete altogether. However the calorie counter to log your food is ace."
The app will not work if you don't allow it to make phone calls. It is another app that is becoming megalomaniacal. Like most people I simply use this app for it's health tracking features and will never use it for anything else. My next health tracker will not be a Samsung if things stay this way. Stop forcing requirements that most people don't want.
"Sadly uninstalling this. There is absolutely no reason why it needs permission to make calls. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling. Worked only for a day, then back to trying to force me to allow those permissions. Otherwise, this was my go to app."
"The up grade has made this app unusable. I have data missing, weekly summaries no longer show comparable information. I would give this app a wide birth. It's gone from being a great exercise companion to pointless"
"Was working fine before the update. Now, after accepting the new privacy agreement, I can't even open the app!! Keep getting the same error message. I've deleted & redownloaded 3 times now. Same result."
Don't like it anymore. With the caffeine monitoring and the weight management screen gone it's not working for me. I used those to plan my meals and make sure that I stayed close to the recommended calorific intake. Bring it back please!
"Since the professionals of the app are so versed, I trust & love it!"
I agree with a few of the other users. I wish there were a baroda scanner to input foods. I have a note 8 used the food input at first but it became too involved when trying to input everything manually.
"It was working nice when i had a7 2018 ,but when i recently migrated to one plus 7t the app is not syncing the steps from my gear fit 2 pro and showing syncing errors . When I open s health from gear fit plugin app then it syncs... please solve this problem . My android version is -10"
This app helped me run 10km for the first time in my life! I am 37! Completed the 5km and 10km in built program. I stopped using other sports apps! Be great to add more personal features such as tracking shoe use and when to replace (based on usage)
"This was a great app and it just stopped working. It still tracks my steps and lots workouts, but the app won't open anymore. If there is a fix, please let me know so I can adjust this rating."
"I upgraded my phone from a 2 year contract and lost all the progress which I had earned And 'it's took me 18 months just to get back to were I was. I used use same user name and transfered the data with the adapter that came with my S8 and then you get people at top of the list claiming they are walking an average of a million steps a day. Yea right my job involves walking none stop so I know that them counts are falsified,all I want is my step count accurate and up to date ‚úå"
Won't go beyond privacy notice screen on startup and asks for permissions. What permissions exactly....and where to find the settings for them? I've allowed all that I think necessary but it seems it's still not enough!
Great and easy to use
Tried to read my stress levels and this app just ends up causing me stress. The reader on the back of the Note 8 is garbage and this app just can't seem to read my index finger no matter how many ways I hold it.
A once great app now garbage due to login requirements.
I have a cubii and I do not see where I can add steps in this app. Am I missing something?
"I liked the app a lot until the last update was wanting me to allow the app to manage my phone calls and contacts. There's absolutely NO reason a health app needs to manage those items, let alone have access to them. Uninstalled!"
Latest update is wonky. Says my heart rate was over 215 bpm when working out and over 100 resting.
"Great app to keep you health concious. main limitation is actually not the operation of the app but rather sure if the activities. For instance, the steps challenges are good but it can be demoralizing when you group people who are genuinely trying to reach those steps with people who succeed in day one. i signed up for broccoli challenge for the month of June. the target steps was 200k. Some people achieved that in day one. what was the point for average men like me"
"says I slept with rem .. when I never wentvto bed, stayed up all night"
"Used to love the app. With each update we have lost more and more features. Without the old features (calorie tracking, ext) this app is useless! A $2 step tracker can do the same as this."
"There is NO WAY I'm giving you permission to make calls. What an idiotic request for a health app. You can add all the features you want, but this should not be mandatory. App will remain uninstalled until this is solved, no matter the excuses you write in reply. . UPDATE in answer to your answer: an optimal experience would be for these permission grants to be optional. I don't want this forced down my throat. Your reply as predicted has not convinced me to reinstall the app."
Heart rate no longer works on S23 Ultra
"ETA: My comments still stand. For what I use Samsung health for, neither 2FA or access to phone dialing and contacts is required. Make them optional. Problem solved.; Phone permissions added in the last update need to be made optional. The app has been working great for years WITHOUT this required permission. Making it requires makes the app worthless. As well, 2FA needs to be OPTIONAL."
Loved the older version. Version 6 terrible. Does not track properly. Had to reboot using original version and lost ALL data. Why don't they leave well enough alone?
What does managing my phone calls have to do with using this app? I could see if it was something relevant...but managing PHONE CALLS! None of my other health apps need to manage my phone calls for me to use them. This app is no longer easy to use due to its attempt to force me to agree to managing my PHONE CALLS!
This app is totally nonsence. When I cross check with my mobile stopwatch it seems a huge difference. And even the app announces that workout paused. Every 3 minutes I has to resume back for daily goals. So in installing.
"I started using SHealth before investing in a GPS watch. I used to use the connected services option in SHealth to autoupload my runs to Strava. I later bought a Garmin watch. the Garmin app sychs from my watch, then to Strava within seconds of saving the session (brilliant). SHealth used to pull a copy of the Strava details relatively quickly, but then stopped. Samsung have removed the connected services ability. supposedly leaving Strava as the only one, but its totally busted. Removing app."
Since update doesn't think my watch active is connected yet it is in the wear app so now steps and activity don't sync between phone and watch. apparently the Dev doesn't even know the difference between Samsung devices or the issue of the device not showing as being connected
App isn't working because I won't allow the new call permissions. Seems unnecessary for a fitness app to be making phone calls but who am I to decide which of MY apps on MY phone can call people. Samsung has responded the same spiel to tons of reviews complaining about new permissions. Being able to make phone calls from my health app does not optimize the app. Please don't respond about it being a new app either I've had samsung health since it came with the first galaxy phone.
"I agree with most of the others. You DO NOT need my phone access for this. I want to use this for PERSONAL health and have ZERO interest in using the ""Samsung Together"" feature it wants my phone permission for. Fix this and I'll download and use it again. Its CRAZY how much of our privacy these developers want access too!"
"Used to be great. Now it no longer auto tracks steps, just walked over a mile and it says 15 steps. Does not auto detect workouts, no longer tracks heart rate or stress...it's useless."
Ever since I had smart phone I had Samsung phones and have been using their app exclusively. Now with this new update of verifications and access to things which has nothing to do with my health whatsoever. I am moving on to another app which is sadly not Samsung... kind of a let down this is..
"Am writing this because of recent Samsung update has left this app saying ""updating"" for 2 days now. I can't stop it nor change etc. it's annoying as keep getting the notifications, yet it doesn't seem to be updating or working at all!"
"After last update I see this app as a useless - wieght management and the food management were valuable for me. Without these functionalities, it is just another sports app as I used before (run keeper, endomondo etc.) Moreover, when I tried to buy a new display to my watches, it costs almost the same as new product and my watches (gearfit2) stopped work completely after 20 months. I do not believe more to Samsung watch products and I do not see this app usefull."
got an update and now the app will only allow the choice to track the steps onymobile phone OR on both devices. i only want it to track the steps from my watch. spent 300$ on a samsung watch and this makes it complete garbage. never should have left the Fitbit
"Long time user of the app...until now. I updated the app and now they require a samsung account to use. Years of not requiring it and now they REQUIRE it. There's a reason I have yet to make a Samsung account...because its useless, as Google does everything and better. Sad they had to ruin this easy and functional app that came standard with new phones. Before uninstalling, remember to delete your data! Dont let them use it! (Option is below required log in)"
"I've been using this app for over a year and it has been of great benefit to me, but this latest version where the weight management has been removed is very disappointing to me. I wish I could revert to the previous version and get that feature back."
Love this App and it is fun and helped me a lot to become healthier! Just one note - It would be great if the steps would be updated in the challenge automatically without having to go into he challenge tab of the app.
I do enjoy this up a lot but I definitely think a few things need to be added to make it improved a lot one of them being for people who smoke(like myself)to adding how many cigarettes they have a day to keep track and also ask more about physical health such as myself and I cannot do as many steps/exercises because I have severe mobility issues there should be more health questions asked to fit your needs.. so I really hope this app can be updated to fit more complex needs.
"It has been a great health until I face the issue of steps not syncing with my fit e steps. My watch can reflect 14k steps and sync to health, is just 1600. This is very contradicting as it reflect I'm exercising yet the steps are not counted in."
This is a good app for tracking your food intake and exercise. It's bad at everything else. After you eat a small breakfast it will recommend you jog for 80 minutes to hit your calorie goals for the day. It only congratulates you for weight lost within 24 hours even if you've lost 30 lbs in 6 months.
"After latest update, my watch will not sync my data with this app. I use a Samsung Note 10+ and Active 2 watch. It's really getting old to manually uninstall and reinstall every time you all do an update."
"I want to like it but... For any phone other than a Samsung phone, this app seems to be well below average. Blood oxygen level is never monitored during sleep and only takes readings on demand, the sleep monitoring is terrible and so inaccurate. I'm using a Google Pixel 6. My advice is find a good sleep monitoring app and a different health monitoring app. I would almost say Google Fit is better on non Samsung phones. And Google Fit is bad."
Overall not too bad. Fitbit I think has a better community and game selection though. Wish you could do multi-person challenges. Or other types of challenges other than just steps.
"Its a good app for tracking steps and setting challenges. However the amount of obvious cheating going on that is allowed by the developers is ridiculous. After 1 day every single month there are people with 200k+ steps, some simple maths will tell you this is blatant cheating, but nothing is done till the next month, then the following month new cheaters show up. Just makes genuine competition impossible."
"Used to love it, but it seems to be loosing feature. It would be nice if one could just plug in a workout done, for example. I don't use the 'workout' part of the app too much."
"Latest update broke galaxy watch since you can't use app without granting permissions to allow phone calls and access to calls? [Edit] - hardly an acceptable reply. All app features were working prior to this latest overreach. Why the bloated app permissions now? Judging by the recent reviews, I'm not in the minority. Roll back the permissions."
I have used this app for years and have loved it ! Super bummed the heart rate graph in the exercise section is gone üò¢ I really really liked that and relied on it. Please bring it back !! ü§ûü§û
"Doesn't open, after login the spinner just spins forever. Terrible app. The mobile is Xiaomi 9T Pro, an the watch is Samsung Active Watch 2. Clearing cache didn't help, nor did restart, reboot or reinstall. The app simply does not work."
"Wasted my money on an Active2 this week. I was assured by cellular reps and in Samsung chat that the Active2 had a blood/oxygen sensor. Seems that was inaccurate. My husband researched the watch and everything he could find also said the watch would monitor blood/oxygen. I've waste 5 hours today during watch setup because I was certain I just didn't know what I was doing. Now I read that it does not support this function. With Covid19 and the mask mandate, monitoring this is very important."
"Lost calorie goals tile with todays update. Well, it's been 4 months. Still no fix? Wow, 2 years later, calorie gials still don't work. Tile is permanently gone. And when I go to enter my calories my goal keeps changing."
Useless if you have a galaxy watch. The allow to run in background button is greyed out so if you are running it shuts off after a few hundred metres. It used to work but update has ruined my experience with this app
Only gave it one star because had to. Downloaded the app to use with my Samsung galaxy watch. Tried to open the app and it took me to a log in page in my browser but no log in fields given. Logged into my Samsung account from the Wearable app but still could not access the health app. Completely useless and frustrating. Get a grip Samsung.
great app!!! would be awesome to add a feature that allows users to choose and search workout programs that work for them based on the equipment that they use at the gym or have in their home.
Love using the app. I just wish there was an option to upload food options dependent on the region that you are in. My previous phone was from South Africa and it has South African food. This one has British options and I can't change it.
Extremely unimpressed that spo2 measurement was removed. I rely on this daily. Now i will need to carry a seperate device. Please put this back in the next update Samsung. UPDATE because the developers refuse to listen to your feedback I have installed an old version and turned off updates. Dont fix what isn't broken.
Why is the SP02 sensor gone on this app for the new samsung? If it buried in the app where is it located??! I have spent hours looking to get it on my newer version of the same brand of phone. Disappointing.. this was an amazing ability for these phones... but the new ones they have taken it off or completely buried it somewhere.
Great health app. Will sometimes missed record my nap. The band adjustment may have been too loose. Will cinch it tighter to see if this will improve. Seems like the Snore Detection had improved after wearing my Watch 4 Classic more snug.
"Sleep data leaves some to be desired, sleep tracking doesn't show resting heart rate along with your sleep data. That's a pretty standard measure in sleep performance, also hrv isn't available with the samsung health app or any other app I have found. Sad to see!"
"Went to use the app again as have started getting fitter now that lockdown is coming to an end. Fully intended to use it a lot more. I wasn't allowed to open the app because Samsung wanted permission to make and manage phone calls on my device through this app. This I denied, why do they need these permissions? If you're not going to let me dictate what permissions I grant on MY device then I'm not going to allow your app on it and you won't be selling me any peripherals either. Bye!"
"Dear developers, in this time of Covid19 pandemics please give us back the SPO2 tracking! It can save lives! Please, don't be selfish: it seems you removed it because the last Galaxies have a defective sensor: then please give it back to at least the phones up to the S9. On my S6 it has been working great. Please don't answer SPO2 is available with Stress measuring: it's not enough for tracking! Please, be human, help us fight Covid19. Best regards from Italy PS Answer just re-states the issue!"
"Weight loss and gain should happen slowly over weeks, months, years. Not days. The day trend being an option on the weight section feels irresponsible What happened to the blood pulse oximeter oxygen dedector red light? I know with C0VID you probably wanna stay away from people using your app and possible liability with going to the ER, but I miss it. I loved knowing my blood oxygen level pre-pandem*c....now it's gone.üò™ Decent app not terrible but not great. 3 stars"
"For me it is frustrating to use. I am averaging 7,000 to 10,000 steps a day with the app. There are days I do not have pockets to carry my phone so, my steps are not counted, which is fine I get it. The problem is that this app never likes my steps. They are never ""healthy"". I have some issues with my hips, so fast walking is not something I can do. Plus, I tend to not walk in urban areas of paved walking paths. My steps are on different terrain, up hills down hills, etc. Nice for steps."
Loved this app and suddenly it stopped recording my steps... can't get it to work.... won't give me my history... there are 4 little dots pulsating... as if it is about to give the information but they just never disappear...I don't want to uninstall or I will loose all my history which now I can't get! Very disappointed!
"The lastest update is so frustrating, I had try to sign but was after sign in ,the app couldn't go through just keep me waiting and can't even go through, all my effort exercising data had been gone. So disappointed with sumsung. Health app."
"Suddenly the app won't allow me to measure heart rate, oxygen, or stress level despite my phone having the built in sensor. Don't know why this is or what to do but it's made the app useless. Any app can count steps and log water intake. I'm not purchasing a galaxy watch to access features that I already had access to."
"Use to be a great app. Now with new privacy concerns, Samsung wants you to protect your stats with a 2 step verification. Will not accept my phone number. I am locked out. Can no longer use app. Why can't I opt out. Hate what they've done. Just deleted it. Will search for a replacement."
"I've been using this app for years now but ever since the update yesterday the most useful features have been removed and its quite frustrating. Please change the features to the last version, Samsung."
I love this app is easy helps you set your goals and invite your friends it's even better because you can challenge them to see if they can do it toothaches is so much well the only issue I have is that this app doesn't sync to my garmin forerunner I hope you can address this issue and fix it soon thank so much
"This app used to be good, accurate and reliable. Now its really hit and miss. Just returned from a three mile walk, not a single step counted! Thinks it's time to find a different app!"
This used to be a great app but without the weight management component it's completely pointless. Makes me mad that I have a Samsung watch. Was great for the last few years but got a new phone and it updated this app and it's terrible.
This app was working OK until a couple of months ago. It has stopped accurately recording my walks. Distance is not accurate. I've uninstalled and reinstalled to see if that corrects the problem.
Can't trust Samsung. Purchased the Active 2 for the promised ECG and Fall Detection. Another instance of false promises by Samsung to get you to purchase their products. Only for them to go back on their our product information. I advise you wait till the product is actually on the equipment before you purchase. Only then can you actually believe anything Samsung says.
Has the calories in vs calories out feature (Weight management) and is easy to navigate. That alone is worth 4 stars. Add the ability to create my own workouts and it will be 5 (from me at least).
"Just deleted this app. No-one can tell me why it updates when I have auto-update turned off. And when it does update, it's restarts the phone, even when you're halfway through a bloody phone call. Great stuff up!!!"
You Can only use the premade programs and they suck. I like how you can see it on your galaxy watch. But i wish you could build your own workout program and not just follow what some body builder made. The rest times are too long and i want to make my own circuit. Please fix this!
The daily report doesn't always appear. When it does it might appear in the middle of the day and so doesn't include all the exercise you might do in one day. Makes a global comparison for your age group meaningless when it says you're in the top 41% for your age group but misses 1/2 of your workouts. Using other apps on Gear Fit do not get recorded in Samsung Health. Using strava means all my riding is missed making this app a poor database for my exercise.
"All the sudden the app step counter is only displaying mobile phone steps and when you switch to show all, it won't load up. After years of this app, that shouldn't become an issue. Fix it."
previously there was an option for automatic caloric intake but I can't find it anymore. bring it back please . also I have trouble counting my steps because it stops counting and only works after I restart my phone.
"Samsung Health export to Strava much better now. Samsung Health exports to Strava, but randomly. But now it only supports Samsung devices eg Galaxy watch, it used to support my Wahoo HRM. Google fit is the same, only supports wear OS devices. So I now use a Wahoo health app which sync's to Strava well. Will come back to Samsung Health if get a Samsung watch."
"It gets upgraded now I can't even login anymore. Uninstalled it re-inserted it still can't even Open it. Read the New privacy policy and still can't Open the App. Going get rid of it now... After many attempts to make it work,, including Your suggestion, Which thank you for your answer, I'd already attempted on numerous times I'm still UNABLE to open an use this App. I'm in NZ, so for me to call you is a costly hassle, hence I've no other option but to UNINSTALL this App. It was quite good until"
App no longer shows miles walked for the week. I mean it use to show total miles for the week. Than it went to an average for the week. Now it doesn't give you anything about miles. But I can check older weeks and that data still shows.
I love this app before the change...i normally workout for an hour..the problem that I'm having is that its saying that I'm burning less calories then before the update and my workout distance is less...it also is constantly pausing the app when i go from running to walking...i really don't understand what happened because my workout is still the same as before...please tell me what's going on!!!
"Don't tell me to contact your support team. I purchased a phone that has a built in heart rate monitor, that you then voided because you removed the ability to click on the measure button. So my phone HAS a heart monitor, but I cannot use it. Is this the new plan to get people to buy more of your products because moves like this seriously make me NOT want to buy more Samsung products."
"UPDATE AFTER YOUR ANSWER: I. DO. NOT. USE. ""TOGETHER"" function! Ergo: YOU DO NOT NEED MY CONTACTS AND PHONE ACCESS. - - - - original - - I just uninstalled it, since you won't let me use the app any more without giving you access to my phone and contacts, which you do not really need, as I do not use, have never used, and I do not intend to use the Together function. Shame on you, Samsung. This used to be one of my favourite apps, I was using it every day and found it very useful. I'll miss it."
Reduction in weight should be automatically updated in trends and shown in graph. It will encourage me to walk more. There should be manual entry of actual weight reading as well. Both should be appeared in graph
I don't understand why this app (including a number of other Samsung apps) require you to make an account to work. I've been given the option to use my Google account to sign in ( as it should work similarly to how I use my galaxy tablet) but it doesn't let me finish the process... I've made a Samsung account for this app but now I am unable to continue without setting up 2 step authentication.. why is this app so complicated and set to make android user bear with the Samsung software experience
For some unknown reason the item 'O2 Levels' has completed disappeared off the app completely. There no widget for it and no page of data. So there is nowhere to find my oxygen levels on Galaxy S10. Please fix and have tried reset samsung health and factory reset my phone
"I love the integration that this app provides. I just miss a cholesterol and tryglicerydes tracker, like the glucose one. I need a separate one to do that. Other than that, I love it and I use it everyday. Excellent."
"I am moving! The app is helpful and it is my extra boost to get moving. Goal is walk at least 6000 steps working my way up to 10000 consistently. I need to work on recording food and water intake more often. Nevertheless, I am moving more than ever."
"Manually record function doesn't work, when I try to correct my sleep time recorded on the paired Galaxy watch, it says 'sleep time already recorded,' and won't let me save the correct time I went to bed, so all of my sleep data and trends are incorrect."
The app is good. The only issue I have is that the steps to miles is off. If you walk 8 miles worth of steps. It shows it as 7 miles. Other than that. It's a good app.
"And so...I reinstalled this app after changing phones...what a drag...the app no longer measure stress,heartbeat or oxygenation levels...only steps...what's up with that. It was a 5 star app..now a 1 star app..and read another comment about clearing cache..even did that. Very disappointing."
I have used this one and off for a few years now. There is one thing that makes me never stick to this app. I want to be able to schedule my own workout programs. The ones that are given are either way too easy or require equipment that I do not own. Just let me make my own workout plans already.
"Where did continuous hearth rate go? It was there last week. I see you did this deliberately. Why?! It worked excellently on my GW3 (and before that on GW and Gear S3). You are removing good features without reason and giving nothing in return. I see where this is going. What is gonna be next? Sleep tracking? Your actions leave very uneasy feeling. Why would one buy your products when you remove crucial features randomly without prior warning? Seriously, just stop. And give this feature back."
Last update was Horrible!! I can no longer get in the app with this 2 step authorization. I can't get passed my phone number then it takes me back to the first screen! I just went ahead and uninstalled the app.
"What happened to the graphs????!! They weren't great to start with, but I can't see my heart rate graph. My sleep graph is just solid blue bars of all the same color with no explanation of what they mean???? What is this OVER simplification??"
"Why my galaxy watch is not recording diatance while cycling in automatic mode? I've hard reset the phone and the watch, went through all settings, went through Samsung forums etc.. No answers, no solutions.. Sooo fed up with TOP OF THE WORLD BRAND that doesn't work. If there are limitations like the distance only can be tracked via manual mode, OK but why there are no user friendly explanations Samsung? Pathetic. No more Samsung devices for me."
"Since the time change on Nov 1st, all the steps data in trends is shown as nothing, no recorded data, although the track showed it properly during the day. Very frustrating bug"
the app is very shifty. some of the key issues frequent: - app hangs - data not correctly recorded sometimes - data restored is frequently incomplete - the import and export of data is user unfriendly - manual records get resetted - very different from iOS app
I just started using the app last week and it was working fine. Today it just stopped tracking my steps. I am very upset. I have tried clearing cache then data. Uninstalled and reinstalled. It won't track my steps. I guess I'll have to find a better app. I'm disappointed.
App is pretty cool. Doesnt work well with non Samsung devices unless you use Health Sync app to link it with other branded fitness trackers. Step counter is pretty accurate and tracks almost all your daily items. Not perfect but very good.
"When I first got my Samsung phone I really enjoyed the App but when they renewed their privacy policy and wanted permission to see my contacts, my location,and camera but won't let me get past that prompt in order to use the app I decided to uninstall it and use a different app I don't need so many things in my private business tracking me if I choose to give that permission that's fine if I don't choose to give that permission why does that mean that the app will not work"
"After Android 12 update Samsung Health doesn,t work any more and all my history records are missing (blood preasure, heart rate, sleep data...) that I collected by doctor's advice. I've tried to send a message through app to Samsung technical help, but application requires to enter 6-digit code with note to get this number by phone - and without information how to get this number! So my application continously show ""updating"" for more than 12 hours. Is there any mail that I can ask for help?"
"I really like this app. Recently though I haven't been getting my weekly summaries. Anyone know if something has changed? ***Update*** The day after I posted my review my weekly summaries started again, but then they stopped again. I called customer service. I did everything the rep said, but still no weekly summaries....PLEASE FIX! Why would you need to manage and make phone calls??? I'm really starting to hate Samsung"
Hi .. facing a problem today with the app. Though it is counting the steps but calorie count is struck at 26 though i have done 10 km + walking & running. Tried restarting and updating the app as well but did not work out.
Was fine until latest software update on 30/06/2020. Now just keeps saying app has stopped every few minutes interrupting all other functions. Tried restarting device and reloading app but have had to remove it as phone was unusable.
"Worked great on my samsung phone. But now that I have a Nokia 7.2 from work, I cannot log in. After attempting to log in, it just keeps on loading... No error message or anything... I even get an email to let me know a new login was detected, but the app just keeps on loading... It is not the Samsung members app but the Samsung health app. Clearing the cache did not work"
I loved the app until yesterday when it told me I could not add anymore food items to my food list!! I then thought I would just delete some of the items I'm no longer using but I can't do that either!! I don't understand why samsung only let's you put 100 items in the manual food list. Also why can't I delete items I no longer use??
Whether I set it at 5 or 10 seconds it goes through the 5 or 10 seconds in a flash. Can't inhale and exhale that fast. It's useless. Someone put the decimal in the wrong position.
"Had used this app since getting the phone, but this new update wants more permissions to the phone, which you cannot skip. Shame, it was a good app until this update. UPDATE TO RESPONSE: Why not let people skip that permission? And therefore skip that feature?"
It records bus or car rides as step! Didn‚Äôt expected this very basic thing to go wrong.
So for a while the app was fine but all of a sudden in the past few days the app has been killing my battery and restricting it in the battery settings isn't doing anything and is making me get rid of the app until it's fixed. I am using a Pixel 6
App just stopped reading reading pulse and oxygen using the sensor on my Samsung S10 today. It's now 6/4 and your team is still working on an update to the broken sensor issue. Over a month with no update doesn't look good.
"Not able to use my accu-chek guide or oximeter o2 sensors through this app. I have active 2 watch. Today (17th of March), I received my new phone. I had to uninstall and reinstall the app and now able to get the glucose meter to work with it. I am going to get with Samsung to see if I can get the o2 sensor to work."
"Good way to track the daily activity. Helps compare your progress with other users. Makes you happy to see big progress, go over your daily targets, but also makes you feel bad when you don't achieve your minimum targets. Good motivator to get better health and fitness"
It kind of does it's job... A major issue is that it does not sync with Google Fit. Also the dashboard keeps adding items I have removed. Finally STILL no dark mode in 2020... Half baked at best.
"This app is useless. I have to manually enter everything. The watch is horribly inaccurate and unreliable. If they're trying to catch up with Apple, they have a LONG way to go. Uninstalling."
What happened to the ability to read oxygen saturation? It was there in previous versions. Am I just blind or do I have to re-enable that option in some menu? Samsung Galaxy S9+ user in Canada.

"Great app for following your daily calorie intake. Like the way it displays your daily totals for protein, fat, carbs etc, but could do with a daily total for sugar intake as that's quite important to keep track of."
"This is mainly a Galaxy Watch 3 review. Bought the Galaxy Watch 3 mainly to monitor my Blood Pressure, but it doesn't even do that. I was kind of disappointed because of the amount of money I spent for it not to do the primary thing I wanted it to do. Other than that this app does everything I need it to do."
"I dont have some of the features. why? I have a new Samsung 9 note and have been using the supposedly updated version of this app for a few months now. I dont have ""pace setter"" in the exercise area as per the tutorial plus I noticed other things different too. why is that and how can I fix it please?"
"I love the idea, I love the simplicity of the app... but why is menstrual cycles listed under women's health? I'm a man that gets a period, I would've figured that Samsung would be at least a little progressive and keep the ""women's health"" part out of this. Totally unnecessary."
Uninstalled the app when they asked to be able to have access to my contacts and to manage my calls. Loved the app up to that point but it took me one second to decide to uninstall. Absolutely ridiculous app update.
Used to love this app. Especially the heart rate monitor but since installing the update my Galaxy S10 will not register my heart rate. Plus lately even before the update it didn't register all my steps ( I rely on my Fitbit for accuracy in that) but since installing the update it hasn't registered any steps at all.
The app has been great for keeping track of my steps but as of recent its wont automatically record them is there a reason behind this. I haven't changed any settings or at least knowingly changed settings
"Samsung listen up, so many users have reported this app requires too many permissions! You dont need access to my phone's unique ID if I don't use social features, I just want to collect and read my Samsung watch stats. I don't care about peer-pressuring my contacts into out-walking me this week, I just want to use my expensive Samsung devices without becoming your data plaything."
This app intermittently just stops recording or incompletely records steps on its own making it very unreliable. I have tried pausing and and starting counts as well as uninstalling and reinstalling the app all of which did not solve the issue.
You have really screwed up this app this time with the latest update. This app can no longer connect to my watch so it can't share the watch data or sync with the watch. Thanks a lot. Where has the sleep part gone? I used the sleep app every night.
"Samsung completely lost customer sense. They removed basically all retrospective tracking options. I am especially shocked about weight tracking (monthly, weekly bins) as weight is such an important and easy to track piece of data for one's health. Shame on you Samsung. Drop ""Health"" from the app name please."
"Since it's last update, you can't continue using the app if you don't agree on accepting the settings on managing your calls and voicemail. So sad from a fitness app that accessing your calls."
"This used to be a great app, it helped me and my friends manage weight and change lifestyle. This was main reason to buy a Samsung smartwatch. Like so many people I simply don't understand why weight management feature was removed? Bring it back"
"New update will not function unless you give it access to calls. Fix this Samsung. Response to developer update- The user experience is not optimal since I can't use the app without granting access, which it did not previously need. That means the user experience is non existent - zero. Fix the app so we are not required to grant permissions to features users do not wish to use."
Love this app super easy to use and works perfectly for what I need. The only downside is that I would love to be able to use a bar code to look items up like other apps. I am always on the go and sometimes forget because I don't have the time to research the food item.
"Is there any reason this app is not compatible with my Galaxy Tab S7+? It works fine on my android phone but I would like to see the data on a bigger screen. Update: Actually, I found a way to install it after downloading it from the apkmirror site. Seems to be working ok so far."
"The app shows annoying adds at the top of the screen. That makes it unusable for me. (Response to reply: I am not in the US but in EU, and the app most definitely contains ads.)"
"The app now requires permissions I wont give. They seem excessive to just track my steps. Let me opt out of the ""Together Feature"" you keep responding with to other users. Use of this app was personal. Others, including Samsung Health, do not need to be ""together"" with me on my walks. Provide an opt out! Switched to a manual pedometer. Less invasive"
"This app is draining my Samsung Watch's battery like nothing else. I don't even reach my step target each day or listen to music or anything from my watch, but I have to charge it almost every day now. The watch is not even a year old. I see other people have the same problem. PLEASE fix it!"
I loved this app on my S9+. Once I got an S22 Ultra the app has not worked. This seems to be a general common problem that should have a general solution. Having someone tell me to memorize a bunch of steps and letters and numbers to send is not a solution.
Hate the new interface. Bring back the dashboard look. All info should be available on the home screen without the need for scrolling up and down. Do developers really read these comments? Most of the people have expressed their annoyance with the stupid changes being brought in by the so called update. Anyway to roll back to the older version?
"Why on earth does the app require a sim card? I have a Samsung phone and watch, and want visibility of my health info on my tablet. I can't run this app on my tablet due to this completely arbitrary limitation. This is really poor, and stupid design decisions like this are why I plan to leave the Samsung ecosystem."
It has been a great app i have used until the introduction of this awful update requiring permissions and still not allowing me to agree to allowing some permissions and not all. Really frustrating. I have been eo stuck and i am not in the US to call.
I only want the pulse ox. The stress measurement is a joke. I look forward to deleting this app once someone figures out how to access the pulse ox sensor in a different app. Until then i will keep the old version.
"Stopped weekly summary updates? No idea why.... I've changed nothing and I'm up to date with everything. Really disappointed, I use it daily to track many things. Seems it is stagnant and has lots of bugs now. Bummer."
"Used to track my hikes with this app for years. Now, the total elevation gain is not calculated anymore even though the app tracks elevation. Elevation gain is one of the most important stats, why would you remove that?"
Update*** 3 stars from 5. I have been using the weight management and on this app and have been able to loose 35lbs in 5 months! BUT they just got rid of it!?!? If people didn't want to use it they didn't have too. This was a very helpful tool Samsung! Please bring it back!
So far app has been incredibly easy to use. No glitches. Love the ability to link to my Samsung watch. Recommend app. I do wish I could import nutritional data and have more in depth analysis of my calorie and nutritional intake.
Two factor authentication is being forced on me since new update. I uninstalled all updates and returned to factory settings. After one day the app updates itself again even with auto updates turned off. This has happened THREE TIMES already. I DID NOT GIVE PERMISSION TO UPDATE THIS APP!!! SAMSUNG IS INVADING THE PRIVACY OF MY PERSONAL PHONE AND UPDATING THIS APP WITHOUT MY PERMISSION!! I AM NOT HAPPY ABOUT THIS!!!
"Hasn't worked for 2 years and under the contact part of the listing has a ""no reply"" email address. That is the kind of email address is what corporations send spam from and does not accept inbound email. I tried it any ways and then received the confirmation that it wasn't an inbound email address."
After the recent update the app is not fully functional. I can't use the heart rate and stress level monitoring features anymore . Only one star for this . As I cannot use other features apart from step count
"Update (8-31-2020): Updating to 2/5, for the quick reply. I'm trusting and hoping that Samsung will take into account the dozens (100s) of complaints regarding the removal of calories / weight management. Calorie calculation(s) that factor in heart rate is essential and a deal breaker for many. Original (8-30-2020): ""Until calories are calculated from heart rate, and until this is clearly shown within the app, I'm rating this 1 star."""
"so i just started really using this aling with the samsung active watch and im a big fan, the food is easy to enter, and it auto tracks whether your calories for the day are where they should be. if you use all the features its pretty helpful"
"The Aug 5th update is such a letdown. Why Samsung had to remove the 'Weight Management' section, which was a great feature, is beyond my comprehension. I knew about this ommision, so i had put off updating it, until i accidentally did so. Now i'm really regretting my mistake. I was also about to buy a Samsung smart watch, but because of this ommision, now i'm considering other brands"
"A great little app! I only wish that for the sleep recording function (it records the time you go to bed & what time you wake up) can record multiple sleep periods for those of us with insomnia (I.E: I slept from 12 a.m. - 4 a.m., was up between 4 a.m.to 5:30 a.m. & slept again from 5:30 a.m. - 11 a.m.). And not only should it record multiple sleep periods, but also provide links to better sleeping tips, etc. Other than that, I love this app. Also records caloric intake, blood pressure, weight."
"Seriously , this app works for you guys? It doesnt record steps properly... It works for a while.. Then it hangs.. there and nothing is recorded. I can be walking whole day. But it only shows like.. 10 mins..."
"I use to love this app and used it a lot, but will be deleting it today since it will no longer allow me to use it unless I give it permission to: my location access my contacts make and manage phone calls. I want it to measure my heart rate and count my steps, there is no valid reason for any of these other permissions."
"Good app, but can you please make it possible to view maps landscape mode, ie when I've cycled I want to be able to see a full screen map in landscape, not fixed in portrait. Also, is it possible to change colour of the route line? I cycle along canals and river so blue is a clash colour!"
Something has happened within the last two weeks that will not allow the app to sync to the achievement app. It keeps saying that permission wasn't given. But I've agreed to them.
i wish it would sync with apps like Fitbit and other trackers as i am not always carrying around my phone. i dint get accurate steps or calories burned which makes some of the other functions useless.
"I have been a Samsung user for a long time. Now using S9 plus and Gear S3 watch. You guys don't seem to be willing to keep customers happy!! As a developer do you have any sense in removing the option to use steps from Gear S3 only? As a normal person do you usually leave either phone or watch at home when you step out? If you can't figure out a simple logic like this, how will u make smarter things? Keep in mind there is a reason why Apple users are loyal!! Don't lose customers & go bankrupt!"
The app is great. But in my new samsung A71 phone i cant record my stress and heartbeat. The others feature work super fine but i cant record my stress and heartbeat. Are those feature unavailable for samsung A71? Pls let me know. Thank you
"Major Battery Drain after tracking a bike ride via Samsung Health... My battery tanks after tracking a 30-40 min bike ride using Samsung Health. Everything is updated, I normally have about 75% charge left at the end of any given day. Over the last week I have started tracking my daily bike ride. While tracking, the watch battery drains about 10%. When finished, the battery continues to drop 10-15% per hour. This has to be a bug. It is reproducible. I'm at 19% now should be 75%."
"Since I updated my Galaxy Tab A7 to One ui 3.1, the app is not going past the privacy policy screen. Its stuck on loading animation. Before update it was working fine. I tried everything, cleared app data, reinstalled app, even wiped cache partition, nothing worked."
Edit to respond to dev: I did not install this app it comes pre installed on samsung devices as far as i can tell. New permissions request phone and contact access is completely unnecessary. I barely have a use for the app as is but the fact you want such ridiculous permissions is wild to me.
"When will the developers be bringing back the Weight Management feature? They deleted it months ago in the summer and its been 6 months! Same response it given to everyone that the feedback will be shared with the Dev team, but nothing has happened! Keeping the updated app doesn't do anything until the Weight Management feature is brought back."
"Excellent app, but new update just (damaged it) -- added bugs, losing inputted data, favorite added food no longer showing up, calories for the day are incorrectly estimated, Saurated Fat eaten is showing up as not enough? Starts day with 240 calories over? Please fix app or PLEASE GO BACK TO PREVIOUS VERSION -- IT WAS WORKING GREAT....We should not have to call you. Enough people are having the same Problems...Thanks for your anticipated help"
"I don't want to give this app permission to make phone calls, so now I can't even open the app. I've read Sansyng's defense of this ""feature"", and since I don't have a fitness device, nor do I want to use Together feature, I should be able to opt out of this."
"Though there were some problems in syncing data to cloud, today's update has corrected issues with the sync of data. Now things seem to work fine. Great work again. üëçüôÇüëçüôÇ"
"Its great! However, I wanma see more fit bands implicated into this! O actually like the simplistic way and the amounts of detail that went into the food input. Just really wanna connect my accessory."
"I would give the app 5 stars, but the Global Challange cheaters take the enjoyment out of competing. Samsung states that cheaters will be banned from competing, but in the 3+ years I have participated in the Global Challenge, there are people who routinely record in excess of 1 million steps on day one of the Challenge. A physical impossibility. Wake up Samsung!"
"I really like to new application, much improvment from the last. I just have an issue with entering the weight/body fat. Everytime I open the weight item, the application crashes."
"I don't like that this app almost forces you to use 2 step authentication, the whole login process is so tedious and unintuitive, and at the end I get a network error??! Come on Samsung."
"The best feature is gone, why?? Why would you remove weight management?? The app was fantastic before this last update, it had helped me so much, and now it has become basically useless, I am super disappointed and annoyed üò´üò´üò´ PLEASE BRING BACK WEIGHT MANAGEMENT!!"
Is should add the feature of showing average speed of walking. I guess the previous version had it but the update has removed speed feature. Rest the app is fine.
"It is pretty good in terms of tracking my exercise and recognizing at least one of my exercise: walking. However, it stopped tracking my heartrate with gear2 which is a bummer! Also, it doesn't tell me what is my time at needed heartrate when i do a great cardio."
"Good app. Helps you to stay active. However, guys from Samsung, you should better manage the auto workout detection on the Galaxy watch 2. Riding a motorbike is recorded as cycling. Not sure whether someone on bicycle can accelerate that fast and reach above 40kmh and keep there and get even faster 60-70kmh."
"Crash fixed (when searching for foods) but horrible interface - why do we have to press record then select the meal, when it was done with one click before! Totally backwards thinking."
Permission request unacceptable - wants to access calls. I cannot even start to use this app as I will not give the app permission to access calls and contacts. Therefore I will be returning my new watch as it is pointless without being able to access the data. Appalling product.
"You are not listening to your customers! No one wants to give you the access you want for this app despite your cookie cutter response that it's to optimize its use. My family have been loyal Samsung customers for years. This is what will make us switch phones Edit: Can't believe after reading my review you chose to send me the cookie cutter response, lol."
"Originally loved the app and it was very useful in tracking many different things, but since version 6.6 they have stopped doing the automatic logs for various things for an unknown reason so I will not update past this version."
"You can't have access to my phone! Remove this requirement! As you can see from many users, this is a NO GO. Please remove this requirement, your ""copy and paste"" response does not satisfy my desire to protect what apps do and do not use from my phone. I have uninstalled this app, it is NOT WORTH THE RISK!!!!!"
"This app is already very useless! It was great before but now it's useless! If you put the app in your pocket, then this app does not work. If you turn on the app and keep the phone in hand, then it works a little. It was not like this before. Walk for an hour, it's in your pocket. If there is a phone, it tells only 400 meters.üòî"
I used to love this app. It had a calorie counter/weight management &caffeine tracker that I used everyday &had it set up with everything that I needed. Now it updated &only gives me a few things &all the stuff I used everyday is completely gone. Extremely disappointed &honestly probably won't even be using this app anymore. The update made it completely horrible for me &I used to get so much use out of it. Step counter works but exercise function doesnt record those steps anymore. Awful update
Used to work great and have good features. Now all it has going for it is the oxygen and heart rate monitor but it never picks up my finger anymore no matter how hard I try. Basically ompletely useless app now.
"Please bring back the original running voice stats for the duration workout it now tells you what km you are on elevation, km duration, estimated km duration, speed and estimated time. It used to tell how long it took for each km duration and when you hit your target km it told you how long it took. which was great for tracking my progress and getting personal best times. Now it tells you nothing of time and seriously I don't need to know elevation on the running"
Wants access to make phone calls. Won't open without it. Upd: The answer regarding providing optimal experience is ot an answer at all. I don't need an experience when an app makes phone calls for me.
Not able to sync my virgin health miles app to my steps from Samsung health. It keeps telling me to make sure my step tracker is active on Samsung health and I have changed anything on my gear or S9 phone. I have been using it over 2 years like this and now getting this error. Three days later it start working fine again .Not sure if it recieved an update.Thanks for your support.
"Just joined. I don't think I have even finished inputting all the info, but I like having so much of my fitness info in one place. I like checking my steps, logging my weight, water intake, & sleep, & seeing the collective calorie count of my food choices. It helped me set a goal for weight loss, & informed me of my BMI. I have joined a fitness challenge & see that it involves people from as all over the world. There are also numerous articles that I can read."
"Because of all the recent changes: no more O2 measurement, no more quick measure, etc, I can no longer support this app. The reason I enjoyed it was the quick measurements. I enjoyed not having to carry a bunch of ""stuff"" around. Thanks and goodbye."
"I like the app but don't love it, needs a few things before I can love it. Needs vitamin D listed in the foods part because vitamin D does far more than people realize. Also, when manually adding food, if online, it should look up the nutrient information for you, right now you have to look it up and then line by line add it."
"Aside from allowing me to answer the phone, time my tea and read messages, it's functions are marginal. We row 2000 lb monomoys; you can't open the rowing part on the watch only the phone, and the app notoriously underreports activity and calorie burn."
"Just perfect. The app is great. You can be in a good shape, enjoying your steps and sharing challenges with other. it's really helpful. Simplemente perfecta. El app es genial, te mantiene en buen estado y te permita compartir retos con otros. Es muy buena"
"It never counts my steps. Did a 4mile hike and it says I went 700stepsüôÑ. I have tried it on many occasions and it fails to count steps. I tried to clear cache-follow your suggestions, and still doesn't work. Very disappointing."
no longer counting my steps. it was never great but now it stopped completely. i wrote the email contact. hope its fixed fast bc im losing steps n steps are $....also its annoying bc its the app they force u 2 use on the samsung gs5. trust me if i could delete it i would. if u force apps on us at least make them work. ugh
"I have been using this app for years but I moved up from the SG8+ to the S22+ and there's NO WAY to use the app. All I get after syncing is NOTHING. I can see everything before the switch but no way to use the app, now.!!!"
It supposed to count every floor climbed 9ft compared to fitbit 10ft for each floor...I have to swing my arms right up over my head for it to count 1 floor and that's only when it feels like it. The health app also doesn't show floors climbed only on watch
"Once this app was great. After ur last upgrade the Challenge community is gone so I ain't using it anymore. Not 2 mention weight management, calories in/out, macros etc. Sleep tracking doesn't work for ages now!! Ur ""upgrades"" actually suck, sorry. Ur Workout plans: u can do MUCH much better, add new plans more often than once in a blue moon and ADD SEARCH OPTION: WITHOUT EQUIPMENT, especially now during Covid. SH App has totally failed Samsung & what one would expects of such a quality brand."
"annoying. the app is good but you cannot stop the notifications. you turn them off, the app turns them right back on. repeatedly. i have uninstalled because it is just too annoying"
Can't use the sensors anymore after the last update and that's what I use the most. Having everything in one place was useful but as usual they'd rather you buy their watch to get the most out of an app instead of just leaving well enough alone.
"No female health tracker?!!! coming form Fitbit, this app is such a disappointment. It has some good features but as a female that feature is very important... I also miss the different groups on Fitbit and the community."
Why oxygen not showing even watch recording and synchronization done. Rest all is coming. Can you correct it. Even catch cleaned. Or it's permanent problem to your apps note 9 was showing well but note 10 was not showing
"Clearly alot of people cheat on the challenges, they complete the monthly challenge in a day! This makes it pointless for anyone actually trying to do well and motivate themselves. Please address this samsung. I have an active job and run regularly and get around 20,000-30,000 steps per-day. How are people getting 100,000 or more steps per day????"
"Update - 2-2-21 - still no return of features that I had when I purchased this watch. Will be selling all my Samsung gear. Update 9-2-21 - still no update, empty promises. Taking this to consumer affairs as this is no longer what I purchased Samsung weight management has been removed, and I'm very unhappy about this as the watch / app is no longer fit for purpose. Features have been taken away since a brought it. Australian law would suggest I could get a refund.. statutory law?"
Recent update on the Galaxy Watch broke the GPS. All my runs are shite now cause it does notndo the basic thing it should.
"Used the app on Galaxy S5 till it stopped working after an Update. Loved it. Now have on my new Galaxy S9, simular app so expect great things. Wish the app incorporated the BP measure feature for the Galaxy S9 like the My BP app and had glucose Bluetooth received & record feature or even a test strip device to add on and record glucose direct. I know, we always want more! üôÉ"
Suggestions: Better if samsung health monitor is within this app (instead of a separate app). Smart alarm in the morning based on sleep pattern (REM/NREM) would be useful if introduced. Smart alert in case if the HR and Spo2 falls below certain level for a particular duration could be introduced.
"If I could leave zero stars, I would. Don't get this app. 4 years ago it was great, but with each update it gets worse and worse. No one at Samsung cares, read the replies to the reviews and you'll see. The replies are so common you can tell a computer is replying. Even when someone complains about updates, the reply ends with something like ""make sure you update."""
"This app is has become completely useless. You didn't need permission to make calls or access my contact list or files before and you don't need it now. ""Implementing features...optimal experience"" blah blah. Shut up. Uninstalled."
"Could be a great health app, unfortunately it has been clogged up with samsung product ads that are forcibly overlayed into the app and actually introduce instability in the app itself as the app will immediately crash if the page you're wanting to view entirely loads ahead of the samsung ads banner being fed in."
"This was a good App working well, all of a sudden after a security update in the Android OS, it has stopped recording heart rate during exercise (Walking) and also measuring resting heart rate. Pls look into it and suggest solution"
"There is some issue regarding calculation of distance. From past 3 years, i was able to complete 1 km diatance with approx 1200 steps. From last week, i am able to complete 1 km with 1600 steps. Also the speed is being calculated incorrectly. Please fix on priority"
"Hi, The apps it was good now with the update are not shown the calories burned. And also the face wash same only show the steps. Very disappointed to by a smart watch that doesn't track calories burned."
"Samsung has over reached by requiring permission to use your phone when it was not required originally, and when the app was promoted as an associated feature of the Samsung watch that cost $350. The boiler plate response to countless negative reviews demonstrates no intent to rectify things. After an online chat w/Samsung it was again evident no changes would come. Terrible execution on many levels. Love watch, miss the app. Buy my watch back or make app work without new permissions."
"After the latest update, started draining phone battery. Usually can go 2-3 days between charges, after the update I'm already down to 64% battery after 8 hours. App is now always at the top of the usage and I don't even open the app."
Gear Fit is connected to the phone but hasn't updated my steps since Oct 2nd. I'm losing a lot of data for my steps challenges and cannot find a fix. This is really frustrating.
"keeps popping up with unable to open app because my phone was ""rooted"". its not rooted and i never use this app, but it has become so intrusive with this stupid popup. had to uninstall. force stopping app only works for a few minutes then it comes back."
.....Update (3/4/19)- many thanks for your reply. I have tried your suggestions on Samsung Health but to no avail - in fact now despite recording the steps during the day when it turns midnight the steps turn to nil - no steps recorded. Please advise me on what I can do to rectify the problem. Robert Benjamin-Hardie
Well hurry up and update again please. I used to love the app but I recently purchased a new phone and now all I get is access denied contact us. I've done this and did everything besides factory reset. Sorry but I'm not factory resetting my phone for this app as much as I did love it. Please fix this soon so I can change my rating.
2fa not working and can't be skipped. Struggled for 20 minutes. Why even have 2fa on a god damn health app? Dumbest thing ever.
Latest update stripped away so much interesting data. Used to be abe to get averages per week or month. Now forced some 'average' without any clarity about period used to determine average. No control over any of this. I'm quite disappointed by this update.
"Updated - thanks for the number I already told you is of no use as I'm not in the States üôÑ Been using this app for months alongside my Samsung active but got a new phone and now can't sign in. I've uninstalled, reinstalled, cleared cache, cleared storage and nothing works. The only helpline number is in the US which is no good for me. Sort it out Samsung."
I only use it for steps and heart rate and with the Samsung band I have now the app is good enough.
"I've been having a hard time opening my account, I've been using it before but had to uninstall it due to storage problems. But now that I've downloaded it again, it just shows the sign-in window then after clicking 'Sign-in' nothing shows up and then there's only a white screen instead. Hope this will get fixed, thank you."
"Initially gave 5 stars loved and I really still do. But the latest update got rid of weight management and now it won't account my workouts into my calories for the day. SAMSUNG HEALTH I DON'T NEED A LEMON TO TRACK MY CALORIES PLEASE GIVE ME MY METER BACK!!!! üíò it!! Helped me track steps, workouts, food, and lost 30 lbs already. My calories for weight management and food area don't match up witch is annoying so I just go with the lower of the 2."
"Love this app but very frustrated by one thing! You can set the units of measurement for everything EXCEPT food intake (energy). How come I can set my blood glucose level unit, but can't do something simple like change from KCal to KJ? I know the American market is huge but they're dragging the chain with the archaic imperial system. Fix this small annoyance, and it'll be a five star application."
"Like the app, however it would be better if you could log food in advance for days to come. Also giving an option to set calories for a weight loss deficit would be good."
"Was great with Samsung Galaxy phones up to the s9. The Heart Sensor on phones has been removed from Galaxy S10 devices. The sensor is not available in S21 to measure heart rate on the phone. Samsung removed the heart rate sensor due to limited mounting spaces on the device. So in order to measure heart rate, oxygen & stress level, you have to buy and connect the Samsung watch."
"I loved this app until the most recent update. Now I can no longer see the grams of protein, carbs, and fat when recording my food. Since the update, I haven't even recorded my food. I finally got in a good routine to lose weight and this just completely screwed me up."
I mainly use this as a step counter but recently I've been tracking what I eat as well. It's very helpful to see what nutrients I'm getting and lacking in. I would reccomend a barcode scanner to make tracking food easier üôÇ
"Ask for too many permissions. And no I don't want to log into Samsung account. Have use Samsung phone over the last 10 years. This, together with other Samsung restrictions (eg simple call filtering function with number starting with x) on the phone is time to switch."
I used to be able to record my heart rate and stress on my phone and the sections are there but no way to record them now and I've gone down a home trying to figure it out and now it's just pissing me off. Any assistance to tell me how to do this greatly appreciated. I gave a Samsung note 20 ultra...
Not working on OnePlus 8 pro. App installed ok but when trying to sign in just get the loading circle and never moved off that screen. If anyone has any ideas how I can get it to sign in it would be greatly appreciated.
"I have been using this for years and have loved it. After the latest update neither my watch or phone are tracking my steps properly. Even if I have the phone in my hand and walk, steps are not being registered properly. I have checked all settings. I am using this on a S20 Ultra 5G."
"Though i am an OnePlus user, I used to enjoy using this app. It was an absolute pleasure and an unparalleled experience. BUT I don't know why you guys have decided to remove the weight management feature. Its a humble request from a fellow user to kindly bring back the feature."
I desperately need an option to edit/add padt workouts manually. I very frequently forget to start the timer or stop it. It makes keeping track if workouts incredibly difficult.
A lot of different options. Very cool. I wish they would add a workout diary to it where I can manually plug in my sets and reps. Only thing that's missing for me.
Fun and motivational! I love the monthly step challenges and the map that goes with it. The only thing i wish it did was allow users of non-samsung phones to play as well.
Workouts you can actually add are limited and additional workouts arealrelief listed but you aren't able to add them as data. Biggest flaw for me is no way to add flights or floors for hiking and stairs. I do a stair workout daily and Apple will track flights but on this app my workout is the same if I do 5 flights of stairs vs 200. I tried putting my phone on my leg and holding nothing was recorded. Manual adding is not available.
"The app now requires a samsung account with 2 step authentification activated in order to work, but for some reason, i just can't get the code in time so i can't use it ... can't use any samsung app in fact. This is a gimmick health tracking app not a banking app, so, such a thing should be optional and not lock you out of the app. Not even google requires that, but samsung be like ""NNNOOOOO! we gunna dew it anyways"". Thanks for deciding for me and locking me out from stuff i paid for."
"Great app.Wanted an app that could track all the activities. Please change the settings for the constant tracker in the notification panel, its srsly the reason I thought of quiting this app and it bugs me everytime I look at it"
"You buy a watch, and relevant application of it gets rendered useless after several months. Why would you remove weight management which was the single lost usefull element of Samsung health. What can you even use this app for now? Cannot calibrate the needed deficit with your target anymore. All you can do is counting steps and water consumption without any meaning. Why in the world would Samsung do that? Will you be refunding people that bought a watch to now see that it got made useless?"
Wish it would update Steps when I manually enter my treadmill runs. And if it had the ability to help remind me to move hourly on my watch. Use to have both features but no longer does. Also wish you could edit tracked exercises.
"Ever since I upgraded to Android 13, this app is causing massive battery drain on my Pixel 5 when paired with the GWA2. Especially overnight, my phone's standby time has been significantly reduced. Please fix this!!!"
After the last update it isn't working right !
"Last UI is afwul, flashing flashing is dangerous for people with epilepsy or similar disorders. So much for health app! Manual input is now much worse, no Next button. Restore previous version!"
"Can't get past login / 2FA setup prompt. App has an issue preventing login\2FA setup. Details: When opting out of 2FA, I'm greeted with a generic username error. So then I try to enable 2FA (no problem, I do this with all my apps), but when I submit my 2FA token, the Next button is non responsive in the UI, preventing me from advancing and finalizing my 2FA setup, ultimately preventing me from using the app. This is infuriating as it renders many of the functions on my Samsung Watch Series 3 useless (such as sleep tracking). The app previously worked on the same device. The devs responded to my post, encouraging me to setup 2FA, indicating they clearly did not understand my issue and skimmed over it, so I have no hope for getting any actual help. This is beyond dismal."
"overall the app is pretty good. i have not used any wearables with it. I have only used it to track my daily activities by manually recording them. I guess the app has a step counter you can rely on but i cannot attest to its accuracy. Minus 1 star because how can i wake up, have had no food and still be 400 calories over?"
"Keeps telling me my session has ended and I'm signed out. I open it. Not signed out, but it just spins and spins. Cleared cache. Updated. Nothing. IRT dev: I'm not calling an 800 number. I'm just going to buy a Google watch and finally be done w all thing Samsung."
there is no multiple stress button or selection in the stress section to get an o2 reading. so quit spouting that as a fix. the removal of that function will be my main reason I will uninstall this app soon unless it is added back. plus I was texted that I got a response via email from my previous comment and email to the company. it brought me to the app page and the comments section where I guess I have to search hundreds of comments to find the answer to mine.
"New update is pretty swanky, I like the new UI, but the app is basically the same as it was before, except for some reason the function to see your average weight over the course of a week has disappeared?"
I would have given this app a 5 star rating but I thinks it needs a better way to input food eaten per day. I would like more options for serving sizes like different measuring cup sizes and teaspoons sizes and even a handful option. Other than that this app is great!
Literally nothing has changed. And yet every. Single. Time. i try to open the app. It tells me the privacy has changed and i need to update settings. So here is me deleting the app and moving on. And yes the app is up to date. And yes i restarted the phone.
"If I could give zero stars I would. Used for years and now all of a sudden they want access to control your whole phone. The generic response is criminal. You have added people's business contacts automatically to there friends on this app, and that's just what we see, you intrusive, vile leaches. You don't make enough money off the sale of phones and watches etc?. Uninstalled and ditching all Samsung products."
"Whats up with the newest permission request? This morning I was invited to grant permission for data collection, and now my galaxy fit 2 doesn't seem to be sending data to the app. Does this mean I need a new watch to use this app? If so, a heads up would have been appreciated. I just upgraded to this watch 4 months ago."
"It's a wonderful app, I could lose 6 kg in 2 or 3 months , It could track steps,motivate me, track my food and workout. I highly recommend this app to anyone wants to lose weight."
"You shouldn't deny based on phone permissions....never used to make us do that and I very much enjoyed the app. I also understand your comments regarding a better experience by allowing the phone permissions....well, you're losing alot of folks that just wanted it the way it was before REQUIRING phone permissions."
"While using whatch3 it automatically sences walking or running, when actually I am driving two wheeler. It should sence that no human being runs in speed of 60 to 80km per hr. There is some glitch in algorithms, must remove or rewrite it. Elsewe can't get what we have done in day, it gives faulty results"
After last update the Heart Rate Zone is not corrected for age. This happened before but I can't find the fix. Have tried clearing cache - no change. Data on Watch (Active2) is correct. Data in app on S22Ultra is wrong.
"Great App. Used since I got my first smart phone. The icing on the cake would be if this App allowed us to edit our protein, carbs, and fats. With that much control I would bet every other food and excercise app would decrease in their use."
"Why, oh why would they remove the weight management feature?? That is the primary reason that people use these apps. My Samsung watch is basically just an expensive step counter now. Especially because it no longer tracks how many calories you burn in a workout either! It just has a set amount for whatever generic workout that you choose. I am going to sell my galaxy watch on Ebay and buy a Fitbit instead"
The app is great I've used it on many of my Samsung devices. I have a problem tho that I would like your help fixing. My normal work day consists of me being awake from about 12pm to 5am every day. Which it turn results that I'm more active at night. The way the step counter keeps track is from day to day not with someone's own day to day so to speak. Therefore results in my steps not being accurately recorded. If you could somehow include this as a more personal feature in your next update.
"Removed trends from weight tracking, so now it will only display your current weight and nothing else. Makes it impossible to track weight loss over time, or even may show a weight GAIN even though your average from the week may be a weight loss. Extremely frustrating as it all worked perfectly and was removed for absolutely no reason."
"The app is made very well and I enjoy using it daily. I give the app 5 stars but the credibility half that rounding down to 2 stars. There needs to be a way of stopping cheaters every month a new challenge begins and within the first 24 hrs someone has 150,000 plus steps which is physically impossible. Maybe require the pulse to be on because the cheat method is by putting their step tracking devices on mechanical devices. Please address this issue for all of the honest health advocates."
"This app used to upload the data my iHealth blood pressure cuff and scale. Ever since the new update, this link is broken. I'll need a new app. Update post Samsung reply: you strive to make your app feature rich by removing features? That statement makes zero sense. I did call customer service prior to my review, and they confirmed that samsung removed these features....so much for feature rich."
"I loved this app until the latest update. Now I can't tell if my calorie intake is over, under or good. I used that part of the app everyday to track my calories, and it helped me stay motivated to exercise and eat healthier. Please add this back to the app!"
"On two Motorola phones, the Samsung Health app hangs at a loading screen after I log in and enter a two-factor code. This happens after three different two-factor methods and I can't figure out how to turn off two-factor authentication so I can try without it."
"I just bought a active 2 and the calories burned is fake, aka completely made up without considering the heart beat. I have been using other fitness trackers for years and ever since I switched to active 2, the calories burned for activities are so low. So I tried weight machine function and just sat still on the couch doing nothing and observed what reading it gonna give me. Ended up it recorded higher calories burned than I actually did the circuit training with average heart beat of 150!"
Overall pretty great. Although I would love if the app let me set my own macro goals. It does give you like the percentage and grams but I am forgetful and would rather see like a bar that shows me how close I am to hitting my macros.
"Now days all companies want access to your contacts information. Really disappointed that this app requires continuous access to the contacts when trying to use the ""together"" feature. Plus all the ads Samsung brings up on all their apps are pushing me to get an iPhone now."
Used app to record distances on daily walk. In past month the distances are all over the place. Regular walks were 1 km exactly are recording as 1.7 km. Most frustrating. Considering another app
"I use this on my oneplus phone. It has great integration with the phone. Only downside is the battery drain. Since it is a Samsung app, I feel it drains battery faster from oneplus. Apart from the battery drain issue would definitely recommend."
"Was a good app until the last update. Could I recommend beta testing before rolling out an update? I'm not sure if you've lost some talent on the dev/program team, but this app is now almost unusable. A 6'1"" 185lb man is now borderline obese according to this app, reccomended daily nutritional values are gone, a 9 mile snowshoe trip with 3000' of elevation gain now burns less calories than a 5 mile jog. Whats the point of tracking this info if the feedbacks are wildly inaccurate?"
"Check the leaderboards on 'Together' inside Samsung Health. Apparently Samsung promotes cheating. Approx 900,000 steps taken by the person topping the leaderboards.... 900k steps in 6 days! If you can't maintain it, just remove the feature? Can't be that tough to check who is cheating and who is not. Auto steps generator should be pretty easy to be identified."
I wish I could edit my food target beyond just calories. I would like to be able to set a macronutrient goal and track those more closely. I will continue to use the Carb Manager app until I can set and track my macro goals within this app.
Absolutely useless app. Heartrate zones are not correctly set. No way to use the fitness app to practice when the zones are way off. Samsung should have done much better and listened to the users.
I liked the old layout! This layout soesbt allow me add all my different workouts and see what I have accomplished through the year or month. Bring back the old look of the app and its options!
"Food diary could be less steps, and easier to use. Most importantly, the app needs to allow scanning of food label bar codes to input food information. Easy logging of exercise besides walking/running needs to be added."
"De-installed and reinstalled app to see if the stress test would work. App freezes everytime I try to measure. Used the app over 2 years, lost all my logs. Hope this fixed the bug."
Good app but can no longer track my blood pressure on my watch.
I've been using it for quite awhile and i can say that it works flawlessly with Samsung wearable and you have so many programs and running workouts to chose from. give it a try.
"I very much like this app. So much I do, that even after getting a phone of other brand I kept the app, and even bought a wearable (fit2). However, after the last update ( 3 days or so) the app won't open no matter what I do. I was satisfied up until now, but this is incredible annoying"
I love love this app it is the best so far I love the challenges helps motivate me to keep moving The only thing I wish is that you could scan the barcode for your food items but even without it it's awesome. i recommend this app to everyone
Along with all the other reviews - I liked this app until this last update. Just horrible. All the responses from Samsung regarding only using the information to implement the app seem like excuses. Those accesses to phone and other information was not there before. I just deleted the app because I was so annoyed. I was missing it and thinking about reinstalling until I saw all these reviews on how horrible it has become.
The app was fine until a couple of days ago where multiple times in the day my phone kept buzzing with notifications and the app was stuck in 'updating' status giving off multiple notification sounds. Uninstalled
"Well I did LOVE it. Then there was an update, now the stress gauge does not work at all. GRR :( about to uninstall. And the App is non-stop running in the back ground even when given all permissions. Cannot fix. GRR"
"I love this app!! I would however like to suggest 2 things, 1 being a food scanner and 2 with auto fill setting for meals allow for adjustment of meal times. is it possible to add gardening to the exercise menu?"
It doesn't work if you don't have a Samsung phone.
It's a perfect üëå app thanks really perfect üëå app
Recently stopped working on my Pixel 6. Server error (0x2C#0#null)
Cheap phone and pathetic service.DO NOT BUY SAMSUNG. I am suffer from past one 1 year.
Need better widgets for home page
"Like for reals after update, it started to glitch on me, and it became so annoying. It doesn't load properly and always crashes. As well as the trackers it never loads."
"I am enjoying the app alot, in terms of keeping track of my activities. I would like to be able to adjust the pace workout speeds or it should adjust according to your previous workouts."
"Okay after one insane struggle without Samsung Health's assistance, I noted that the first day of the 7 days falls away to make space for the next day which is day 7 ... That why your leader score lowers at times on the leaderboard"
"Piece of garbage app. This app no longer allows writing step data from other apps. So, if you are one of the millions of people who choose to use a fitness tracker besides they're worthless trackers, you can no longer write to your Samsung phone. This app is now completely worthless."
"Locked out of my Samsung account due to 2 step verification & having changed my number, Samsung refuse to retrieve/unlock the account & want me to create a new email & Samsung account poor policy"
good app keeps me motivated. one idea I can think of is when challenging somebody being able to do over 24 hours or a specified time rather than having to be the first one to reach the target goal.
"One of the main purposes of this app, to track calories burned with Samsung watch, horribly overestimates caloric loss through exercise. It's overestimating by about 330 calories every 5km. If I run 15km, I get a caloric loss of 2664 calories which is insane. It should be about 1600 calories, give it take. There is NO WAY 2664 calories is an accurate result. Edit: and the phone number given for help goes to dead air when you select English"
Map doesn't function anymore. SAMSUNG S22+
Does not track every exercise
"Dear Samsung Electronics, I recently wrote a review saying that it tracks my steps automatically and you may have thought this was a negative sounding review but I meant it in a positive way. You see, i am a plant ops engineer at a hospital and I'm constantly back and forth all day. I would have never guessed i take an average of 13000 steps at work per day but there it was in black and white with the avg miles, call burnt, etc, so i thought this was amazing, awesome. The best fitness app out!!"
"The app does not even open for me anymore. Have contacted Samsung several times and sent error reports, reset phone etc all suggestions and still nothing works. Have used this app to monitor health/steps for years so very disappointing"
Doesn't not work. I use it for heart rate. Can't get anything
I have used this app as a motivator to stay active. I love the global challenge. And have never had an issue joining. But now the March 2020 challenge is full?? At 200k participants only? Unless this is fixed I'll just be deleting the app. Update! It's all fixed!
"Return sp02 oxygen tracking to the app (Canada). It is not in stress tracking and my notice said it was canceled going forward. This was one of your major selling points with the s8. How can I tolerate this, especially when the app also desynced from connected apps like sleep as android? Why would I ever buy another flagship Samsung product if its features would depreciate/vanish?"
"It stops by itself just like that. I opened the app, chose the workout, and after 4.7 miles I wanted to stop and saw that only 0.9 miles been recorded. Yesterday the same. Don't want to run with this app anymore."
"Hello, The app is üëç. But I have one simple remark. I have doubts about achievements of those who are in the leading position.They reach more than one million steps in 10 days . This means that they were walking, running or cycling for 10 successive days without one single stop no sleep no meal which is out of reach. How can we trust that the data are real !!?"
"Latest update has taken away the mood options when measuring stress levels, why? Do you have an email adress rather than an an expensive phone number? Maybe you could put the mood options back? Why change what wasnt broken?? Why is date showing January 1970 when i measure my stress levels. This is since last 'upgrade'"
After updating doesn't count steps in sleep mode.
I need to clarify what I said. I followed the steps to enable 2 factor. I first accepted the policy update then I tapped on set up. I typed in my number and put in the code. I tapped on verify and it takes my back the previous page. I went through this multiple times with new codes everytime and happened further.
"Loved it. Can't give more then 2 stars because of the removal of weight management. For me, at least, that was the point of the whole app. Hope we get it back soon, otherwise, will have to search for an alternative app."
Ridiculously stupid decision to have to login to Samsung account (why the.f*) to be able to use the updated Samsung Health app!. Just not able to reset forgotten pw. Email recd in arabic n phone no reflecting with a wrong country code which I am not able to alter. i want to switch back to previous version since I did not even opt for the updated version. has been imposed pn me!!!!
The measure button just disappeared. How to get it back?
What happened? I can no longer log exercises
It doesn't work properly üòê
"Used to be great, but now we can no longer track heart rate, stress, and SPO2 levels. And as someone with long haul covid issues that have been effecting my O2 levels, that really sucks."
"Doesn't sync with MyFitnessPal. I've tried to sync them (installing and uninstalling mfp, restarting phone, force stop, ect) and it doesn't work. It's the only reason I used this app. Go with any other app"
"Does not work with a Gear S3 Frontier watch, but did a year ago! Very disappointing since it did work before one of the updates. No more steps, sleep data, heart rate, and exercise."
"I love it when using with NOTE5, it track automatically. However when I use it with Huawei nova3. it didn't detect automatic. I have to open the app and it will start working. When return to home screen it do nothing. Any one can help me for setting?"
"I agree with you Joel. I went to use my app today and it said it needed phone permissions and I declined. Now I can't even access my history or anything in the app. Sorry Samsung responder below but we don't believe you. If you are using it for ""optimal user experience "" then why can't you be transparent about what exactly you are providing that is supposedly helping us exercise?"
"An overall nice fitness tracking app, but sadly Samsung decided to restrict the permission for external apps to access the heart rate data. This makes the Samsung fitness trackers and smartwatches quite useless in the Singapore National Step Challenge, where the heart rate data is required for additional bonus perks and points. Forced to purchase Fitbits / Garmin for my family after I realised this limitation."
Says to access log into my Samsung account. After years of use. I don't want another email address so this app just became useless. Too bad. I used it every day. IT GETS A ZERO STAR RATING NOW! It was a good 4 but since the update that removed years of data. 0. So not cool of this company to do that. Creepy also!
Was a great app untill recent update. I suffer pulmonary fibrosis and use the pulse oxymeter regularly to keep track of my oxygen levels. recent update has removed this. can not find to put back on. you now have to measure under stress. but it no longer records your oxygen levels which was great for my doctor to see. sorry I have to delete this app if can't be resolved
"Will not work on a S21 This app was great on my S8 but the S21 lacks a sensor that is needed for some measurements. Great upgrade of my phone thanks for nothing Samsung. As to the note below, I have already contacted the developer team and was informed that the S21 does not have a necessary sensor so there is no way to make a Samsung app work on a Samsung S21."
"To Katelyn M. I'M glad I saw your review, I currently am using Note 9, but just ordered the S22+. And got the Samsung Galaxy watch4. I'm looking for a good health app. That I can use now and will then in 3 days work well the new phone as well. Development team can you let me know if there's but fixes since her post so I won't have the same issues? Thanks Samantha üòä"
"The weight chart is nearly worthless. I like that I can record my food, but would appreciate the ability to be able to SCAN bar codes for easier input. It would be nice if foods that I use often would appear FIRST. The serving SIZE should be in the content (bread - 1 slice, pretzels how many per serving, etc). My floors are not counted at home as there are only 14 -- I'm not sure what the minimum are, but in a normal residential home is 14 to 16. If I walk the 14 steps in my home 6 times it shows nothing. WHEN is BP monitoring coming??"
I use samsung health to track my mountain bike rides. Something has changed in the last couple of months where it is tracking less distance than actually biked. It also is showing a max speed that is way less than I am actually going. It should read pretty accurately. What happened. Can something be fixed?
"It is a great app for keeping track of your daily activity and maintain your calories intake. I have connected it with strava app in order to synchronise my cycling training, sometimes it doesn't sync but overall is good."
Randomly stops counting steps. It's very frustrating when I've tried to be active only to check at the end of the day and find that I have no way of knowing if I reached my target steps or not. It's literally the only reason I use the app. What's the point if I can't count on this one feature?
"Was a great app until they removed the weight management option! Now it's basically a step tracker and a calorie counter. Can't believe they took out the most critical component of the entire ""health"" app."
Every time there is an update its worse. Doesn't keep track of steps as well as before. When I exercise on my elliptical it use to keep up with in 200 steps that my elliptical would record. Today was the worse SH was 2000 steps behind! Not happy.
"The app is actually very good, but it does not meet my purposes. I have been a long time user of Garmin triathlon watches and wear mine continuously. I would prefer to use my Garmin steps, not my Samsung steps. It used to be possible to import the Garmin steps via a third party app Health Sync, but Samsung blocked this. Since this happened over a year ago I have not used Samsung Health app. I would like to be able to either uninstall Samsung Health or import all Garmin data directly."
The new update is horrible. I uninstalled the app hoping it was just a glitch... I guess not. Why did you get rid of the calorie tracker for your day in weight management??!!! What's the point of the app now??! This is a horrible app now and NOT helpful! This needs to be fixed.
Asks for 2FA which is weird for a step counting app but whatever... Sends me the code and won't let me submit it. So thanks for that added layer of protection I didn't need that has rendered this app useless as a health tracker since I can no longer even sign in. Why the need to overcomplicate this? The app was fine for years. Update to dev reply: I've tried the 2FA through the app and run into the same loop cycle not being able to login as many below. This isn't an isolated event.
very bad app. I lost my running record of almost 3 years after updating the app. This app is needed to keep record of all activities and I lost all of them. Don't even install this app.
Can't get this stupid App to work. I had it installed on my phone previously and it worked fine. Now i have re installed it on numerous occasions and it asks me to give permissions in SETTINGS but I cannot get it right. Will look for another App that WORKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Some recent update made widget much less usable. Useful information (step count) is now displayed using small font to make place for application name and daily step goal (constants). In other words usable information was diminished to make place for information garbage. Why? Could you please allow to change it in widget settings? ##Review update## Another update another degradation. Mandatory login. Why do you do it?
"I really hate when it's'improved' because IT ISN'T...it really sucks..it's even worse than the last so called improvement..now I can't see previous days, it keeps either asking ""were you asleep"" and gives nothing or showing I was awake when I WASN'T! I really hate it when I have ro wait till the next day to see what it said but then can't get it. What's the point of having a sleep TRACKER!!! It USED TO BE GOOD BEFORE YOU IMPROVED IT. And don't tell me to update to the 6.whatever..I DID!"
"Why on earth would you need to access my phone!!!!!! What the actual f?! Fix this ASAP. I can't believe you would have the nerve to require this when you are telling us how our privacy matters. I see in playstore it's required (REQUIRED!?!) for those wishing to use some together feature. Given the number of 1 stars in the last week it's quite obvious many of us never used this feature, and now you can bet we never will."
The best health tracker!!! I'm using Huawei p30 pro and the Huawei health is TRASH I didn't like Huawei design and there's a lot of bugs! So I switch in Samsung health. I'm also switching to Galaxy A50 not because i don't like p3o pro it's just more costumizable just waiting for it to arrive in bought it on eBay. Pretty excited to be part of Samsung Users.
l like being able to keep track of all my exercise and eating habits. Sometimes it gets a bit funky when I try to record anything other than my walking or running but overall a good app.
I've really enjoyed using this app but really disappointed that the global challenge has a limit now!!! Chances are that by the time the April challenge is out I'll miss out like March. Shame as I did it with my daughter and it was a good motivation for her.
"I've had the app for 4 months. It started okay. Bare, not much. Each update made it closer to fit bit level quality for health. I love the last update that shows the 5 levels In workout"
"I loved this app when I first started using it. I liked how I could put in how far I wanted to walk and it would tell me when I was at 1km.and so forth,and even when I was at the 1/2 way mark. Yesterday after an update,that stopped.Cannot do any of that now.So disappointed that I am thinking of getting a different app."
Disappointed that the app on my husband's galaxy requires a watch or band to track heart rate and oxygen. We have the same version but different phones. Mine doesn't need the accessories.
"I used this app happily until it required 2 step verification & so ""friends"" can find me. Only choice is yes. When I decided to do it, it looped, over and over again, do you want to set up 2 step verification? I hit yes button, which asked me to verify phone number. Hit that, & it took me back to the question ""do you want to set up verification? Over and over. So, NO, I DO NOT, & goodbye. Btw, my friends can find me without app & med info should be more confidential."
It lacks some of the capabilities that the Fitbit app has. Also my husband and I did 3 challenges where he beat me on all 3 however for whatever reason the app had me win all 3.. not complaining but what purpose does the app have if it cannot update and show results correctly.
"oximiter is gone why!!. I have emphysema and I was counting on this app only for that, so I could check my oxygen saturation. thanks again this phone is worthless to me now. thanks for the response. unfortunately I suffer with emphysema, which is is a lung disease and I need to check my blood saturation evry time I'm not feeling well just in case goes down to much and this app was a God send to me, was actua6the reason I got this phone in the first place. your suggestion is not applicable to me"
"It's a good App I like it. But it sometimes stops by itself while you are working out, and not count for a regular walk, not so accurate if compare to other Apps. Hope Samsung will improve for better."
"Love the motivation on a walk and especially when she say, almost there. You can do it. Its not always meaduring the distance correctly if I compare it to my friends walking with the smart watches. What can I do."
"Destroying my battery despite on auto close and removing from background apps. Went to reinstall and requires Samsung internet browser (ofc). Then when downloaded says I needed Samsung Internet browser. Total joke. Sort your dreadful apps out Samsung. ü§° Still an issue, using 30% of my battery drain. Had to uninstall. Loads of other users having this problem. Sort it out Samsung, or I am selling my watch."
"The dashboard isn't convenient. The link to Myfitnesspal isn't working and exercise tracking from the Galaxy watch understates the calories burned. The heart rate tracking works well during exercise. Update: I spoke to Samsung Health's customer service, they told me to factory reset the device and I'm still experiencing the issue of calories burned in Circuit training not matching my heart rate..."
Was really pleased with it...then kaboom it now crashes when opening the cycling portion. Seems to crash during detection stage. Afraid to uninstall then reinstall as don't want to lose historical data.
Recovering from broken hip and like the records for walking. Cannot figure why it stopped counting earlier today. I am 89 years old and not much at computers. Hope I can get info to solve this happening.
Have been using this app for months and now required to give you my phone data....don't think so. You do not need this data or my camera access for the features I have previously use in this app and should you need them for other features I should have the option to opt out of them. Previous replies are simply stating that you do not share it....why do you need it? Been a samsung customer for decades but uninstalling this app now...unacceptable.
"I fail to see what features require the app to manage my calls, yet, with the new update, I'm asked to allow call access even to open the app. I just want to see how many steps I have taken in a given time, without giving permissions about my whole phone EDIT: My issue wasn't abouth wether someone is using my permitted fuctions appropriately, but that they are using at all. This was an update that removed all previous features unless new permission was given"
I completely agree with the other persons who have rated this app in January 2021. The last update totally trashed the Samsung Health app. I use it for my walks with my dogs as well as other daily events and now it's all gone it wants information that it has no business needing and just a simple good daily walking and health app has been ruined. I cannot uninstall it because it's on my Samsung phone but I most certainly will disable it and I am looking elsewhere for other good health walking app
"I had previously rated this app five stars, but I've knocked it down to three stars. The constant updates do not seem to be improving the app's performance. The more the app is updated, the more it seems to crash during workouts."
I am beyond upset at the removal of the weight management function. I just purchased a different scale solely because it syncs the weight into Samsung Health. I have bought several generations of the Samsung phones and Gear watches. I have a Note 9 Ultra 5G per-ordered and a Watch 3 on it's way to me now. WHY? Because Samsung Health brought all that information together for me and has my history. This is how I am repaid? Thanks for NOTHING... Please fix it.
"Amazing app! I'm a Huawei user but I have a Galaxy Watch 4, so I've been using Samsung Health instead of Huawei's for a while now. And honestly, it's so much better and detailed. I specially like the food-tracker, where you can find almost every product from any supermarket in my country (Netherlands) it's really impresive."
"The app suddenly stopped allowing me to share step data taken from my Samsung Gear Frontier to the Virgin Pulse app, which i use to track steps for my work health insurance. The app says that I need to allow Samsung Health to share step data, but all data is already selected to be shared. This needs to be fixed."
New Permissions to Use App Why does the new update ask for new permissions just to use the app? Samsung these new permissions are invasive and unnecessary. Users should be allowed to decline features. I do not want to give access to my contacts and phone to make calls. I am not inviting anyone to join or view workouts. What is the purpose for this new requirement if I just want to count steps? Please create an alternate option to use the app without permissions for just a step counter.
"How to ruin a great app in one update! Was any polling of customers done? I'm guessing no based on the flood of 1 star reviews some 1/13!! Usually I anticipate new additional features with major updates, not the stripping of an app of it's best features. So disappointed - both weight management and step tracking analysis have gone from very informative to meh! Please just give us back the old app!!"
"Not able to open this app, when I tried to sign in, after shower loader, app getting crashed. Tried with clearing cache and storage data, even after restarting my phone. Still not working. Using OnePlus 7pro with Android 11"
I really like this app it really helps with fitness tracking and the challenges definitely motivate me. I just gotta say they could do some giveaway's for completing an entire challenge. All in all I love this app.
"Annoying üò° This hasn't tracked any of my workouts through the app but they have been logged on my active 2 watch this week and has been playing about with transfering data to my fitness pal. I have deleted and reinstalled this and even reset my watch to factory settings, yet still nothing"
I love using the app. It keeps me accountable in reaching my steps daily.
"After the recent update, body composition measurements are not reflected under the health widget in the health app. However, data is shown in the watch only. Under the body composition widget, only the trends are shown not the recent values."
"there is only one thing that would make me 5 star this app.. Pleeeeaase implement a button/option for me to tell my watch/phone that I am now awake. Sometimes neither item recognises that I am awake for up to an hour after waking up, even if I am using my phone or gaining steps on my step count. I use Samsung health for everything but the sleep feature is my most used part and this is super frustrating."
After the latest update the ongoing steps are displayed on the notification panel. There's no option available to hide the current steps as it was there earlier. So the only thing left was to turn of the notification and I did the same.
"Health activity not syncing with achievements. I run everyday, but I don't get any achievements unlocked. Auto workout detects and records info from Galaxy watch on to app, but achievements don't kick in."
"From almost great to unwanted. I spent for a Note20 and find the supporting health app is now useless. Samsung should spend less time in a board room as program management and marketing instead of gathering users needs. Then ignoring those needs, and developing new revenue channels (watch), and the current app is the result. Poor product management. Subtract from the greater $Note20-app functionality=lower satisfaction and lost clients. NetPS zero 0 down from 8. Now there are banner ads??!!!"
I wish I never bought the samsung gear s3. After constantly tweaking the watch my the longest the battery can last is 2 days with constant use or 3 days not wearing the watch. I expect future updates to kill the battery faster than the device charges. therefore you buy a new one twice a day. (Update) battery got worse. The initial battery like was 3 days then 2 then 1. At this moment in time the battery life is half a day. Changing the battery did nothing this app is defective.
"‚úåIt is intrusive. Yes, many like that. I prefer real doctors. Privacy. Not against it as a product. Great product. Only I did not request it on my phone. It's just there. Health comments from sales etc. Respond to my health. From this app. It should be my choice to download such products. I don't like tech watching biological or anything without my consent. Thanks for the response."
"This app had been ridiculous. I have not been able to use it without agreeing to all permissions, including use of my.phone and contacts, which idk why that is necessary to run a fitness monitoring app. I have disabled it on my phone."
"Wow - what a slaughter these reviews are. My issue isn't with all the functionality that has been taken away (but seriously Samsung, your Product Manager should be reading these reviews). Why are you putting ads at the top of this app? I've shelled out for your ultra expensive Note 20 Ultra phone and your Active 2 watch and you have to bombard me with ads?? What on earth are you thinking? The saddest part is the official Samsung response claiming there are no ads... unbelievable"
I like the app would be nice for them to actually work with handicap people doesn't have anything for the lower settings that a handicap would have And handicap still like to exercise to and keep a track of these things You're only working for the healthy People. They are missing the handicap market for exercise But they are great for blood pressure oxygen and things like that but the exercise they are very well lacking if they upgrade it would be great I would use it otherwise a great app
"Used to love the app but now Samsung is demanding permission to access my phone calls just to use the app. This is unacceptable for a fitness app so I have now uninstalled and will be using apps which respect my privacy instead. Fitotrack is a great alternative. Edit: Samsung have responded saying this permission is only required for features of the app. Even so, I am still uncomfortable giving the app this permission and the fact the app won't even start without this permission is unacceptable."
"I gave you a high rating but I have one complaint. In my country the word obese is not used now, its demeaning for those of us who are active, losing weight and getting exercise. You stats may be based on world stats. In my country Drs use the term High or extremely high BMI. When talking about weight. Obese is an old word. Please change it, its politically incorrect. Thank you."
Not useful since they don't allow to sync steps from my MI fitband. Samsung just wants us to buy their products. I really hope a new app better is developed soon. Before Sept at least i was able to sybc steps of the activities from Google fit. This app is getting worse and people soon will stop using it.
"Not really a review, but I do love this app. All I'm asking is please don't remove the body composition feature in your next update, I've been running since June & would prefer all my features in one app. Thanks Ian"
"This used to be the best fitness and weight loss app with 'WEIGHT MANAGEMENT TOOL', so much so that I purchased a Samsung phone for my wife. Very sad to see it go and I ask Samsung ""in what wisdom did you delete this tool"". Without this tool it is nothing than a less than average app. I hope they bring it back."
An excellent app which reminds you to be more conspicuous about your health factors. It opens a new window to progressing more... i think they can still develop it into a better predictor and helper.
"Really good app to keep tracking your activity, food and health habits. Has some issues with the step counting but still good option for who enjoys challenges & games and wants to start a new healthy lifestyle."
Been using this app for years across all my phones. I'm not sure how they calculate calories burned. It usually reads double what my Elliptical sure for calories. I take pics of the machines to compare and keep track.
"Good but could improve, by example when I add milk to my food intake the calcium I consumed stays the same? The app is 99% in my opinion but could improve as I have said. Edit: I have just added a can of tuna to my food intake and the iron I've consumed has also stayed the same! Fix this for me and it's 5* all day."
"Great app, lots of foods and nutritional value is great, i really wish you would bring back the over/under calorie measure was super helpful. Now i have to do math to check if im hitting my goals."
I loved this app until the most recent update. Now my steps cannot be recognized by my Go365 App. This app is used by my job and I need the steps counted to get a discount on My health insurance for healthy activity. Also the weight tracking and graph is now gone. Horrible. I will be searching for a new app and deleting this one ASAP.
"Used to be good until the latest update. now the app opens every few seconds saying ""for you security this app cant be open on a rooted device""....I don't even know what that means. They need to come up with a fix for this Asap instead of telling everyone to call technical support."
"I really like using this, one thing i miss though is the option to add naps/ record when you woke up at night, it might be useful to maybe find patterns if such a function was added."
"By far the best App I've ever used for exercise before, I've always had an iPhone but then my upgrade was due and so I got a Galaxy S9 and found the Samsung Health App and it spurs you on with one on one challenges, challenges that also they have that people join from all over the world, I've made some good friends on the App to, after discovering this I wouldn't ever use anything different in terms of an exercise App"
"I mean it's okay. The global challenges kinda suck.. who walks 69 miles per day? Just takes the fun out of that a little bit. I mainly use this app because it syncs between two other apps I use, so I like it for that."
"It's an OK app not the best, would be better if the exercise options were better such as having a full free weight option rather than having to choose individual muscle group options, maybe a HIIT option.. prefer to use under armour app much better more choice and gives clear weekly stats"
I don't write reviews often but I literally use this daily. It's completely replaced my fitness pal for me. My only qualm is that I wish that sugar intake was tracked with micro nutrients because sugar and sodium I'm both trying to watch. Please add sugar to the daily food micro and macro nutrients!!!! Also I marked this app has inappropriate as because on the together page I found people posting spam for inappropriate sites.
Completely useless. Once upgraded password would not work and resetting does not work. Now locked out. Samsung should have figured out how to do better. Ruins the whole smartwatch experience.
"Used it for 5 years, but after last update phone call permission to run app was too much. And even when the permission given, the app tells that account expired and doesn't work. App was fine, but now it's worthless against any other fit apps."
"Demanding phone permissions so I can count steps? Hmmm, no. Please don't copy and paste your standard response. I've no interest in reinstalling. Edited to add, someone clearly isn't reading the posts - no response is necessary, unless you're telling me that phone permissions are now optional."
Recently purchased Samsung Galaxy Fit  I would suggest the developers to fix below major issues with order of priority 1. Battery draining - App consumes lot of battery i.e in my Xperia Z it consumes 40% of the battery. Even with disabled notifications i could see the app is running in the background and not sure whats its actually doing 2.Get the step count right - Thats the first thing most people are buying fitness tracker or smart watch and basic feature that shows at the top of the screen 3.App disconnecting from the accessories - Make sure the device and app connects all the time. Ex : If the Mobile bluetooth is out of range and connection to smart watch fails make sure the app connects back to the smart watch once the Mobile bluetooth is in range  I would suggest developers to fix below minor issues with order of priority 1.Read the feedback in Google Playstore or Apple Store and reply as soon as possible. Its frustrating for a customer that you reply one month later for any feedbacks 2.Dont ask customer to install Samsung Members app. As you clearly know its only for Samsung mobiles and not everyone owns one
"Well, time to remove the app and toss the gear into the trash. Latest update need phone access. Whatever.. Look at all the posts from April 14 onwards.. i am not alone. great way to destroy their business by extra permissions not needed before. i will probably get the same boiler plate response.. no assurance about privacy is good enough. leave my phone, phone logs and contacts alone. Only rewponse needed is when you inform us of a less intrusive release"
So many useful functions. Great design. Easy to use. Doesn't work with my eufy scale but does everything else great. It basically tries to connect but never does.
"Since my Samsung phone was updated on 27th August, my watch takes ages to sync and once it does, much of the data is missed including sleep and heart rate. The data is showing on the watch which is a Galaxy Watch Active."
This app has literally changed my life. I've lost 50lbs since I started using it . The nutritional score is the easiest way to meal plan . I never knew monitoring my calorie could be easy. Keep up the great work!
"can someone please explain why the new samsung galaxy S10e doesnt allow for health measurements like o2, heart rate and even stress ( where I believe is the only way to measure for o2 now) my new phone (intended to be an improved one now does not operate some of my favourite features).. Can you make it possible for me to continue to take my readings please? thanks for replying to me. it's a 5 star app all day long . I've used this app for nearly 5 years and I've always enjoyed taking my readings"
"Great integration I use a lot of Samsung products including the galaxy watch. therefore, this application allows me to integrate all my health data seamlessl. I can sync my goals across devices and the ui is very intuitive."
I love samsung. To provide such a quality phone with this great software preinstalled that inspires me everyday to eat well and exercise efficiently. I have lost 40kg in 16 months without even trying. Keep up the great work Samsung.
"Used to love this app until it suddenly needed permission to manage my contacts and phone calls. Why does it need my contacts list if it's just meant to track my walking and eating habits? So, Uninstalled. Sorry I'll use something else. And if the ""automated reply"" tells me it's to optimize my usage, then I should have the OPTION to not be optimal... right?"
Major privacy issues! The app shouldn't be arbitrarily giving itself phone and contact access! That is illegal! You also need to provide a way to remove the user phone number from the app if the related feature is not being used! We should also be able to disable the stupid Together feature if it is not being used!
as a college student this is a great way to keep track of just about everything which helps avoid a repeat of the freshmen 15 and helps me keep track of my eating habits and figure out when I'm dehydrated vs when I haven't had a vegetable in the last week.
"On my phone and watch, Samsung Health works great. Issue is the app isn't compatible with Samsung's own tablet. Their newest high end device is the Tab S7+, yet it's not compatible with this app."
"Useless, just updated again and tells me that just by looking at this I have used 550 calories when I first opened it it said 459, I did as Samsung wanted and sent a screenshot but they just told me case closed, not very good P. R. I will endeavour to uninstall if they do not get back to me with an answer to this problem. Wish I could have given zero stars"
"You would think that this app could determine that a 40 year old male doesn't need to track his menstrual cycles but apparently that's too advanced for this app because every time I open it, the top half of the app only ever advertises women's health tracking options."
Why did you remove the custom ranges or week and month and year. Only daily now? It's impossible to use and see and or chart progress. Where did all my data go? Why weren't we notified of such catastrophic changes before updating? Please make it look like how it was before
"great app but im having problems with my steps it took 8,256 and didn't put them into the together challenge and made it seem like i didn't have the first star even though i was 100 steps from having the second one in the august challenge if you could please fix this it would be much appreciated"
Not working properly and stops counting steps of its own specially after it's updation. It is not showing my previous records/ steps as I am using it for the last so many years. Previously it was a good App.
So many great features. I would have given it 5 stars if the app would allow me to record and track body temperature readings. It is something every doctor's office takes when you visit and is now more important than ever in a COVID -19 world.
I used to like this app but now it won't work unless I give full access to my phone settings... no thank you! Heading back to fitbit. I've granted all permissions and the app still doesn't work. I've used the app for about 5 months then it stopped working. What should I try next?
"Apparently after the recent update, I am sleep walking. When I look at my phone in the morning, it says I've walked a mile and a half. I'm not wearing my watch to bed, and my legs aren't tired. So, there's obviously something wrong. Good luck trying to report it to samsung. So, I'm adding it here. Please fix the app."
"The APP is good at organizing all your stats and health summary. The social aspect is pretty weak. You can challenge people all around the world and your friends who sign up. HOWEVER, it is only for step counts. SAMSUNG PLEASE ADD more ways to motivate users like adding challenges for Calories burned, select workouts, etc. Also, get notifications to see when your friends start working out/what they did, etc.  C'MON APPLE IS ALREADY DOING THIS."
"Was a great app, but can no longer see graph of my weight over last year. Used to be able to see graph of average weight per week or month like step count, now only graph is daily weights."
Every update is terrible. Please bring back the three snack times or add an option to customize and add our own snack times. Tracking is way more difficult now.
"This was a great app until the update in Sept now nothing but bother syncing with MFP, also older version was much more simple & less fuss, if it dosen't improve l'll not be using, in the meantime is there a way to revert back to previous version?"
Stopped tracking sleep a long time ago. I specifically got the active2 to track my seizure activity and it hasnt worked in forever. I keep hoping with every update it works again but not. Super disappointed in Samsung.
"Will not open on my Samsung, strangely it worked on my previous Oppo. Now a month since this post, I have cleared Cahe, cleared Data, restarted phone, still no luck, cleared data, cleared cache, removed product reinstalled,cleared data and cache again and will still not work on my 3 year old Samsung (spare phone) SO MY REPLACEMENT PHONE WONT BE A SAMSUNG"
"Hi. Prior to my new note 20 I would be able to track and record my heart rate. This is very important and I see other folks have commented on this too. Please bring back. I am disabled and cannot wear the watches and such that you sell. ALSO, please pass on that you should look into supporting the Bose buds as they do take my rate, but I will have to record it outside of Samsung and that will get tedious to support health in 2 separate systems. I would definitely upgrade my stars. Please take these concerns seriously and stay safe."
"Fine app but recent update now requires 'telephone' access, etc. Too much invasion of privacy means I am uninstalling this app. PS- Samsung, before autoreplying to this note that no one is calling to be told that the unnecessarry privacy intrusions are for our benefit for functions we don't want. Like you harvesting our phone contact, even if they just stayed within the app. Totally tone deaf on your part re this unnecessarry intrusion of privacy."
So far good and useful app. For me the sleeping detection works better but need some improvement like it should show the sleep time at status bar. Because all the time its detection is right but i need to open the app to confirm it. And I always clear the notifications so its not useful for me now.
This needs a barcode scanner that show all nutritional information. Having to type everything is kinda crappy. Also make it so you can add recipes and what not tired of using 2 apps to track food.
My biggest disappointment with this app is on the export side of things. There should be a button that allows me to just have my watch steps exported. The app only allows me to send my phone steps through. I have my watch so I can not me by my phone for little things. I work for a company that pays us for steps a d we do different activities. So when my phone is 5000 steps lower then my watch theirs a problem.
"Love this app, I have it from 2016 and never disappointed me. üòä"
"I was really enjoying the custom running coaching. Then, one day, it just stopped. I called Samsung Health customer service to find out that it's been removed. I posted here. The Samsung rep here told me to call customer service again. I did. They said the same thing (different person). This time, the Samsung rep told me how to re-add it. I'm happy now, but confused why two different customer service people didn't know the answer. But anyway, thanks Samsung rep! I have my running coach back!"
"Not working properly over past week. The app starts counting steps from zero every time I wake up my phone, or counting only steps of 4 minutes out of an hour walk. latest update during help."
"Can't open the app, even after I tried to input the new two-step verification code. It just throws me back to the verification page again, asking for the verification code once again. Just like the other recent users' feedback, I also find it absolutley unnecessary to allow this app to access the phone book etc."
"Best fitness app out there, gives u help to get fit from fitness session to getting a good night sleep. Tracks you when biking / running, gives you a map of route and stats that you need to help you train or just motivateyou.. love this, great encouragement app to get fit."
I have contacted the support and they basically told me they have no plans of giving us in the US the ability to use all the functions of my watch. This is just crazy you buy a health watch because it has EKG and Because Samsung wants to sell more of the active 3 they have still not set it up for the active 2. You guys should be ashamed of yourself. I guess greed is a sin and it shows with this companies actions. I'm never buying Samsung again.
"Why would you remove the SpO2 function? The main reason I bought Samsung was for the O2 sensor. and the ""stress"" function is not supported in my country. Also, since its considered a defective device (No longer functions as intended). Is this now covered under the warranty? do we get some sort of refunds for ""technically"" disabling hardware that we paid for?"
I need to track my 02 and heart rate for health reasons which is part of why I have this phone and never upgraded and the new version of the app ... update takes away the ability to track those things despite them being installed in my phone. So essentially now I have useless parts in my phone and no 02 monitor
Need to bring back the sp02 feature. Had data saved here to review with my specialist as I also have a lung disease like many others who have reviewed. Not interested in having to measure stress levels every time I want a simple o2 reading. App now useless.
Snore data with galaxy watch had been working for a month and now cannot get it to work
"Pretty good - could use some upgrades. Would be nice if there was a ""notes"" section to track other items. How are you feeling that day, stress level or other notes for yourself to reflect on."
Well I used to love it. Now I don't because I can no longer sync my fitbit sleep data to shealth. I'd rather fitbit and samsung got together and let people sync all data fitbit to shealth liike we used ti be able to.I can't wear my expensive samsung watch to work so I'm missing out as I use a fitbit instead.
I lost 25 lbs in 5 months using this app. I started by recording workouts and logging my meals. It has a great program that coaches you on how to healthily approach calorie deficits. Plus many great workouts and health challenges. It's a great source to educate yourself on your journey to get healthy.
"What have you done with the latest upgrade, have you not heard of the old saying ""If it's not broke don't fix it"" What has happened to the healthy/active steps count it was a useful festure. Why is there no longer a calendar month step average. I dont want the rolling 31 days"
Like how the app has everything in one place. I wish the app had a bar code scanner for food. I also wish that it would break out the added sugars and then give readout data of how much added sugar was consumed in the day.
"This update has destroyed this app & made it useless. The forced login is of zero use when off grid and away from an Internet connection, I liked the app so much I purchased a Watch 3 and am waiting for the S21 and was the reason I decided to try Samsung. It had everything I required. This needs to be rectified or Watch 3 will be returned and new S21 no longer required. I agree with other woeful assessments of this update. I'm not interested in your copy/paste apologies. This is a dev failure."
"As with every other user who has reviewed recently. Since newest update too many permissions, even when I did give all the permission the app still did not open. You gave some serious software and permission issues. Samsung need to listen to their users. Wish there was a zero stars option."
"Needs more info on things such as Vitamin Supplements. If you add a vitamin in your food logs it doesn't affect the daily recorded vitamins, but it should. Also, there could be a more nuanced method for recording your daily workouts. Calories burned is attached to the time of the workout, and the reps you enter have no effect, as well as not having an option to record the amount of weight you are lifting."
"Great little app but I can't find where I can view total miles walked in a week, month, year. When I click on trends and week/month/year it just gives me an average. I want an actual you've walked...... Miles this week/month/year. Why has Samsung Health not got this? If it does have it then where can I find the information."
"I have used this for 2 years it works great, but now in My Vivo V20 this isn't not working properly, Usually it counts my every step i take but now it doesn't, I had to open the app first then it keep counting sometimes, i want to count my every step even app is closed? Could it be possible?? Because it worked same in my last Cell phone Galaxy Note 10, please reply"
App is pretty good but there should be a way to include macros instead of generic data. Should be a way to adjust macros based on different types of diets and nutritional needs. Also measure should be changed to include ounces/cups.
Tracking your food is so easy! I just wish It tracked more vitamins. it would also be nice if it noticed what nutrients you aren't getting enough of and suggested food they should eat.
App worked fine until recently - it tells me to sign in then redirects to a Web page that says browser isn't supported even though I use Firefox and suggests to use Samsung browser. I'm not installing another browser just for this app. Absolute junk üò§
"It was great, but in the last few months there have been changes that created problems so that I have to uninstall and reinstall the app to make it work three times now. It fails when I am on a hike relying on the app to find my way."
"I like that the app automatically keeps track of all my steps, but I don't like that it doesn't accurately track my information when I use my exercycle. It is aways way off. Plus the information is not combined with my steps for the day."
"I can't access my account anymore, I'm not receiving anymore my weekly report. I opened two tickets for this and received answers like install and uninstall your app. When I said that I did all what Samsung Health asked me in email and it is not functioning, they stop helping and answering to me. This problem is lasting since 2 months."
"Very helpful and accurate. But one thing I wish Samsung didn't remove was being able to take your BPM with your phone. The last phone they made this available on was the S9, I hope they bring it back :("
"I can't select cardio running program anymore in the newest versions. When I install old version, I can't use it. It's constantly ask me to make an update before launch the app. Very annoying"
I use this app on my Samsung Galaxy Note 8 phone together with Samsung galaxy watch. I couldn't view the map the walking and related activities. Anyone knows how i can set up the mapping function. Thank you.
"Update 01/14/2021 - Ugh... the last update was bad enough, this new one is the worst. Hard to use and counter intuitive and took away the daily summary of your macros and made it harder to see a snapshot of how you did on food intake breakdown. Just go back to 2 updates ago please... Old review: It was great until the latest update which erased my weight management section with all my data. Please restore it."
"New update requires access to phone records to use. Customer service only says it's for ""optimal performance"" and has never offered a specific purpose or reason for it to be required. Will not continue use."
10/10 perfect health app. it gives everything in such a simplistic yet stylish way. I love the community and challenges. I hope they add random challenges so we can challenge random people who have similar step trends.
"Stress monitor not working. When I tried measuring stress, it goes to 95% and then it stops working. Unable to tell me my oxygen saturation levels. UPDATE: it is now working. hmm... weird."
"Great app, comes with being a Samsung users too. Can't wait for future iterations. It'll be great if the range of options expands on the dashboard, a barcode scanner is added plus a bigger food range"
"No matter how much I walk or run, it doesn't record single step. And I actually used to like this app. Even after following the instructions given by the developer, it only counted my steps for a couple days before it went back to not counting anything at all."
"I uninstalled the Samsung Health from my phone in order to prevent it from counting the steps from my Galaxy Watch3 and my phone, doubling counting my steps. Unfortunately, I seem to need the app for Samsung Health to work on my phone. So frustrating and doesn't make sense. I didn‚Äôt experience this issue with my Galaxy Watch."
Used to really like the app but now no where near as much after compatibility and connectivity with other apps was removed and now nutrient summary no longer displays total carbs and fat intake. Very disappointed.
very unhappy. it worked for a while now will not sync up my steps. my watch is saying 21000 plus and the app says 9000 plus. this has happened numerous times. i have updated. uninstalled. restarted and nothing.
The last update totally killed the app. I'm also having issues linking the app with my fitness provider. It complains about permissions even though the permissions are granted. I tried delinking the app and linking it again and now it won't even link.
It would be really helpful to have the option to combine hours of sleep in one night if it's interrupted for a short period of time so you don't have 2 or more separate logs of time and sleep cycles (light/rem/deep) to account for. Maybe just log that period as a disturbance or something.
Great app! Working great now! Thanks for the reply!
It's Best üí™ apps for walking. running. Cycling. And others activity . I joined it it since 2017 .üßê
"In Samsung S9 and earlier models, I could check Oxygen level and Pulse in Samsung Health whenever I wanted. In S21, I can't check Oxygen Level and Pulse. Samsung has made Samsung Health App a ghost of its original efficient app. As of now, Samsung App is an useless superficial App. On 1 March 2022, Samsung replied vaguely. There was no specific response about SPO2 and Pulse measurement functions. For me, Samsung Health has become a dead redundant App unnecessarily occupying phone memory."
Weight management was the best feature of the app before they removed it with the latest update. I bought a galaxy watch to pair with it but will now be moving to a different app unless the feature is brought back.
"I really liked this app. I use the ECG part regularly due to heart issues. At some point, the ECG part of the app has disappeared on me. I've searched everywhere. Uninstalled and re-installed in hopes it was just a glitch. I need it back"
I loved this app but now I don't have my heart rate readings on my app. Nor for my stress levels. I purchased a new phone. Upgrade for samsung now I don't have the apps I had previouslywith my samsung s9. I was able to use my index finger to read my heart rate. It's not available. This was a good app.
"So far i love the app, but i hope they put more emphasis carb intake since keto diet is very common now especially net carb. Its hard since i have to click every meal and manually calculate the net carb. I have to do this for breakfast lunch dinner and if applicable snacks. Other than that i have no complains."
I love this app. But since I got a new phone it hasn't linked to my old information. And I can't seem to find a way to add my other email or sign out of the one it's in without dumping everything else on my phone. So all of my accomplishments are gone :(
"for ed to use an app that I did not install. just because it's a Samsung Phone! There are many apps I am being forced onto my phone without my permission & I can't remove them once they have been placed. Not Right to choose for me.. unhappy w/ Samsung!!! see below response to developers after their lame response to me on ; why can't I uninstall it not just disable it & as I have said it isn't the only app Sunsumg has, that I can't uninstall & they also update themselves as they feel they need."
Since the Jan update the swimming lap length tracking is extremely unreliable. It was so good before but now it frequently counts a lap as two short laps. And now I have to authorise access to phone calls - if Samsung actually cared about my privacy this would not be a mandatory permission. Not happy.
They've destroyed the app by demanding new permissions to go through your contacts and a poor 2FA implementation to get your phone number. Responses to other reviews are lying to customers saying this is necessary (it never was before and these features worked fine). I will never buy a Samsung products again and recommend the same to everyone I know. This is a breach of trust.
Suddenly the app needs full access to phone and camera? No need. No opt out? No way Samsung! Zero stars... I refuse to give this app access to my phone and contacts (there was and is absolutely no acceptible reason why It should needs this). And as long as the app does not work without I have no choice other than stop using it. Btw: Don't give us this copy/paste response about Samsung not accessing any information! This is about security and privacy. Not about developers intentions!
"LOVED LOBED this App until sometime in late Aug/early Sept they ""updated"" the App & ruined everything. A mile for my 4'10"" height is 2000 steps (it has NEVER EVER down 2000 steps = 1 mile for me it shows it @ .68 or .74 so I.'ve manually had to figure my weekly mile count). IF that wasn't bad enough during the update they took away the total weekly steps they posted & I had to go searching & had to again manually find each days steps..add all 7 days then arrive at my correct total. Today is is 10/21 & now they don't even have that feature. Customer service is a joke they know less than I do they blame it on Google..lol. I just un-installed this junky app & will look for one that meets my needs!!"
am having serious issues with my Discovery App and Samsung Health App.  They are not reading each other or allowing me to link them (they have been working seasmlessly since January with no issues....). The issues started on 20 Dec.  I have emailed Discovery Health.... and they have asked me to install and uninstall the Discovery App. Which i did ... as well as uninstall the S Health App..... which I have also done.  They now dont even read each other (the 2 Apps). Please HELP
"Pretty good! It'd be nice if it showed my resting heart rate value, and described how it's determined. I would be willing to pay for an ad-free version, within reason. (At have the option, for all Samsung apps.)"
do i have to register just for it to work. day one it tracked the steps i took. day 2 it tracked me very well. however day 3 it did not track all my steps and activity and now day 4 its not tracking any. i also have the gear watch and i have been up for 2 hours and moving my watch and phone still say zero. it notified me of my inactivity but i am moving around.
The last update has left this app completely unusable. It never let's me get past the 2 step verification set up no matter how many times I try to set it up. Huge bummer!
Something happened when I hot my new Samsung I loved the stress management feature with heart rate monitor and oxygen levels..I am a nurse and . My phone got me thru covid crisis. I have searched the Samsung health on my new phone and that feature is missing. No one can tell me it seems how to get it back
I have started logging food through myfitnesspal as they have a richer database. however Samsung health now cannot sync with myfitnesspal since the last update. I like open systems that let me share my data across applications. I hope Samsung can reconsider its new policy of closed system. If I wanted a closed ecosystem I would buy iPhone.
"Customer: why does samsung health need permission to make phone calls, have access to my camera and contacts? Samsung: you can choose what permissions to give while installing the app Me installing the app: refusing to give access to any of the 3 permissions mentioned above doesn't let me continue with the setup process Samsung health is much better than google fit, but lying in your face os something I can't tolerate."
I love this app it helps me keep up with my walking. And my health. I reccomend it to everyone I see. It doesn't count all my steps and miles but I still like this app. I have the app on my phone and I love it too. I wish I could manually do my own sleep though. When you go to the bathroom at night it changes my time of sleep and wake up time. Because I go back to sleep.
Uninstalled the app. Your canned response was completely inadequate. I have been using this app for years and now Samsung wants to collect my phone number! No way. I don't need or want two-factor authentication. I would rate it zero stars if I could.
"amazing app for measuring your calorie defecit. I live in pakistan, there are some region specific foods that I can't log into. If there could be an AI method to take a photo and it tells you how much calories you are eating, this feature would be amazing to have. some Gym related exercise are missing here aswell. The less time you spend on logging your meals and exercise the better it would be to keep on using this app."
It's a fun app helps keep me motivated to do better the next day. I don't use it fully like I should but just using the step counter and basic options is more than what I need so I can only imagine how much more I could do if I utilized the app to is full potential.
"App used to work great but stopped working a few weeks ago on my Galaxy 9+. I tried uninstalling the app and reinstalling it, clearing the cache and keeps saying ""an unknown error has occurred (0x2A#0)"" and then crashes"
"Before the last update it used to be a 5/5 star app, but you can no longer set weight targets that change calorie target(if you can why was the option moved?). I find the new interface to be more of a hassle to find my settings."
The previous version of this app was great when wbei used to add 1 glass of water it used to add very fast but now not the same speed anymore. I drink a lot of water so i need it work fast like in the previous version.
"After watch update, watch no longer shows me calories burned during the day, watch also does not track stairs/elevation. Nutrition information carbs/protien ect. Hard to find and not presented in a clear manner. WARNING TO EVERYONE BUYING THIS WATCH. With every update, features get taken away. This watch is useless to anyone who is trying to get healthy or fit. I will be tossing this watch out soon and getting a Garmin unless samsung fixes their product. I dont have time to phone your company."
"I like the ability to see my monthly and weekly stats. I like the new layout, but I don't like that I can't see my monthly stats. Seeing my stats in a weekly and monthly form helped me with better planning. I would like to see that feature back on the next update."
I refused the new update based on other reviews and they still locked me out of the app unless I'm willing to give access to my contacts and phone. Screw you Samsung Noom here I come. UPDATE:Got the auto reply from Samsung Health which is total BS there's not one function of this app requires them to access my calls or my contacts on my phone and forcing two stage verification is ridiculous!
"Best fitness app ever! I absolutely love every feature so far and the only thing I would ask you to add is... When working out I use weights and sadly there is no option to say your working with weights, this obvilusly shows me less calories burned than I would actually burn. Please add a feature to say that your doing squats with weights etc. Otherwise this app if Thousands of times better than Huawei Health and other health apps I've tried!"
"Such an odd move by Samsung to take away weight management, I had only just bought an active 2 and changed to a new samsung phone to get the most out of the health tools and now I feel completely ripped off. You must understand that they were the main selling point for me. Very disappointed."
"Refuses to use heart rate sensor on s21 Ultra. I got the s21 ultra specifically because i needed the feature since i was upgrading from my s8+ Unlike the s8+ samsung health gives NO OPTION to use the built in heart rate sensor on the s21 ultra, leaving you to find a 3rd party app that can actually use the sensor on the s21 ultra."
"As of today the Gear S is no longer syncing with this app. I tried force closing and clear the cache and rebooting the Note 10+, all with no good results. It's been a great run."
Very frustrating how the app updated itself and suddenly I have notifications for all sorts of things that I don't care about and it's not intuitive where each one of them is or how to turn them off individually
"Hi samsung team, since yesterday after I updated to latest version I'm not able to sync with virgin pulse app, the latest version does not have the option to provide step permission to virgin pulse app. Please help to check.. thanks so much"
I used the O2SAT measurement frequently and appreciated the ability to track and trend the results. Greatly disappointed when it was removed. Not user friendly as part of the stress measurement. Bad decision.
"I don't find app useful. I need the app to be able to automatically detect when I am biking. Google maps does a better job at that, and is more accurate too."
"I am reviewing my comments because the app is working again. I uninstalled, reinstalled and played with the permissions and it started working again. Kindly look into the problem of irregular stoppage because this has happened twice now. Thanks."
"Helps me stay on track for my fitness goals. It syncs with myfitnesspal and map my walk. It also syncs with the achievement app which pays me for walking, sleeping, and drinking water."
great app with a ton of features! way more than most fitness and meal tracking apps combined. I just wish there was a way to add vitamins and supplements in the food records.
"I need help, please. I have a note 20 ultra & a fit bit 2 that is 1 year old. App worked fine today but the next workout, something happened to my info available during workouts. Early in the day, the workout gave duration, calories burned & heart rates (current & average both). The next workout, it only showed duration & calories burned with no way to add back the heart rate info. Had app update 7 days ago. Heart rate setting is continually on in the app. What removed this once available info?"
"Latest update is a backwards step, primarily as it has removed the 'trends' feature from e.g. sleep & weight. Good health is all about monitoring trends not just daily numbers. Come on Samsung, bring the trends features back!"
"Few things it's missing for me. Ability to track sleep pattern of naps. And a way to look at weekly, monthly sleep charts. So far the rest is good."
"The app is great and easy to use, but is there any future plans for a possible 'leftovers' button that could let you choose from the previous days meals without having to save it into my food or search again?"
"The app is great but after updates now I can no longer find hiking, bicycling kayaking, yoga and other exercise programs, which greatly reduces our enjoyment of the app. Make my exercise programs easy to find and I'll give you five stars!"
"I've used this for years for counting steps, doing new workouts, & recording food/water intake. There is absolutely no reason why this app should require permission to make and manage phone calls."
oxygen saturation measurement used to be it's own feature. now it is bundled with stress. why? this is not an improvement. seems to be a trend that when Samsung updates an app they make it worse.
"It seems like since the last update on January 12th this year everything went wrong. Samsung, take a hint...look at all the negative remarks people have. I never had any issues before this last update until now. No I don't need to call or any suggestions. Did you hire on a developer that is new to the department? Look around Samsung; give us a new update."
This app is great overall but I would like to give one suggestion to developers that maybe they should update their calorie intake food database to something like HealthifyMe food database which is very extensive. The food database in this app is lacking a lot of items. If the developers are able to do that then this app is the only thing I will require in my phone for all my health needs and it will indeed be 5 stars
You can't change the sleeping variables after it's been saved once. If you go back and try to change hem then app won't save your changes. It's a really annoying bug.
Superb but if the cell phone in pocket than not count steps. I don't know this situation is all of you or only with me. In spite of this superb app.... The updated version on 5 august not working in proper way I uninstalled the app and then install but no in vain. Please help app not counting all my steps. I count myself 100 but app showing only 30 .
"Just Wish That The Words Were Bigger and More Easily Readable Without My Glasses. Not Everybody is Young and Has Got 20/20 Vision. Step Up and Fix it, Please. Samsung. Love the Samsung Fit that I use with This App Alot. The Fit Does Everything that is Expected of it And More !! Just Got To Fix The Text To Be ""Bold"" and Much Bigger Text !! Please. Thank You."
"Was working really well. And I was competing against my friends. Now suddely the app is only picking up half the steps I'm doing. The walking I do hasn't changed. I updated the app which made no difference, today it says I did 5,000 steps whereas another app says 11,000. I walk most of the day so it's unlikely to be 5,000. Disappointed I cant use the app anymore."
Worked well at the start now every time I open the app to look at my excersies or start a new one the app closes out. Super frustrating and doesn't seem like I'm alone with issue. Uninstalled and reinstalled now lost my excersie data.üòû
"Excellent app to keep track of health related records. Easy to use and accurate recordings. Keep up the great work!! Thank you for such a user friendly and wonderful app, which can be used by common people like us!"
"The app requires access to my phone, and contacts. What for? Otherwise it does not allow accessing application. Be aware. This start happenning after samsung updated the app. This is a privacy violation. Plus if i decide to use another app - my data with samsung health app are lost."
Whenever I try to log in to Samsung account through Samsung health app it shows up in Indonesian language instead of English. I cannot find any option to change the language. I think this is happening after the update. I'm using Oppo mobile phone and I have Samsung Gear S3.
Since a recent update it keeps asking me to login to an account that I've never set up. I have deleted and reinstalled it 3 times and it works for a few hours but then reverts back to the wonky account issue. It's so unfortunate because I enjoyed this app for years. Why did they break it?
"This app has been my inspiration to get fit. It tracks my workout and gives a sense of accomplishment at the end because I can see, track, and document my progress."
Lot of issues with latest update. Floors section is removed and buggy. The fitness recommendation in my case shows only women aerobics and period manage apps. I'm male so useless for me. All the supported apps in plans are gone now.
"Do not use, removed from my phone, keeps attempting to update regardless and keeps notifying me of available updates almost to force me to reinstall it (otherwise my phone will randomly shut off to install the update, but not install the update because the application isn't on my phone)."
"Useless app! It used to monitor heart rates, oxygen saturation, and all kinds of goodies on my note 9...now I upgraded to the new note 10, and it says I have to buy the Samsung watch to use this features again. I already paid you $1200 for the damn phone , now they want another $350 for a damn watch too...NOPE! Last Samsung phone here."
"I am unsure if my new phone Samsung S21 isn't able to take HR measurements or if the newest update to this app makes it unable to read measurements from phones anymore, thus making it a necessity to purchase a separate reader and synce the data. Anywho, the app now is useless as I can no longer measure a single thing from my phone/app. Huge disappointment as this app used to be so nice üôÑ"
My s20 fe 5g has updated twice and the Samsung health app is frozen in time. It's been stuck on 303 steps and acts like it's trying to load for the past few weeks and will not sync with sg3 watch since the updates. Help?!?
"Not impressed. A lot of the nutrition info is wrong. It tracks weight lifting by timing you, instead of putting in weights/reps. Not sure where it got my weight, but it was wrong. It's weight goals are absurd. I'm a 5'11 male, 150 lbs and it suggested I take in 1800 calories. Leave fitness apps to someone else."
The app is useless since the update keeps telling me my session has expired and to log into my Samsung account again. I've logged in 20 plus times in a row and still says I need to log into my Samsung account again. I used the app daily for multiple purposes but now I'm forced to look at other apps that serve the same purpose.. Fix the problem and I will revise my review!... REVISED after the current update I am now able to access my s health app thanks for the bug fix!
"A few things I would like are more than just 50 characters for a note, especially these days. Allow manual entries for steps, maybe with a checkbox like the food stuff you can define yourself like 'took out the trash' 'checked the mail'. One thing it seems to have stopped doing was reminding me at 0100 hrs to get active when I maybe checked the time in the middle of the night because I woke up to pee üòÇ I wish there was better stuff for older or less able users or after surgery recovery help."
"I literally bought the Samsung smartwatch 3 for the ecg. I have had it 3 weeks and cannot find where to get the app. The website is useless for instructions, watch didn't come with instructions. Found on YouTube where people are using it but on my watch it goes from heart rate to blood oxygen to sleep. I like the app but I cannot get it to do what I bought it for!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
The sensor for the heart rate and stress tracking feature no longer works and hasn't worked in quite a while since a certain update. Get it fixed.
"Had been happily using the app for over last 3 years, until for last 2 months. It started asking for 2 step verification, where it doesn't go through the process. Sadly not able to use the app any longer."
"Great, one place, to track all sorts of sport activities, sleep, weight, weight, eating, etc. My one small wish is that the group activities also incorporated exercise time, not just steps. I just spent a week on a live-aboard dive boat, and come BBC ack to land and learn that I am way far behind on steps!"
Requires extra unnecessary steps to track food. The older version was simper to use. I could view all my foods and meals for the day without having to click into each time of day seperately.
1st - ty for responding so quickly. 2nd- you fixed the 2 step verification by not requiring another device to set this up. TY because all I have is my phone to access online. I have missed your tracker.. it is the best one I have found!! TYSM for fixing the 2 step verification thing!!
Mine app is not even working i have samsung s10 plus 5g but every time i open and try to signup in this app its give me systematic error issue
"This is a great app. It has become a part of my life. Is it possible , technically, to integrate a Music Card in it so that one enjoys the music while using the app ? I mean Health and Music under one platform."
"Used to LOVE this app, now it's useless! I used the app to track my O2 and heart rate as I'm asthmatic. Now I cannot track my O2 without a watch, and even then it just gives me overall stress and not my O2 levels. I cannot manually enter it either, using my O2 meter readings. Idgaf about steps, I want to automatically track my heart rate, O2, and sleep patterns...which I could *previously* do using this app. Now the so-called updates have borked that ability!! Waste of app space on my phone!!"
"The app is great... it has got me moving and walking my weight off... but... I have to knock I one spot because their are group challenges worldwide and for some stupid reason people are allowed to cheat... claiming over 100,000 steps a day... that is world record level... boot the cheater so those actually doing the steps can compete... otherwise love it"
"Stupid update which got rid of weight management , before my weekly summary would show total calories consumed and total burnt which was one of the main reasons to use this app. Now it shows an average of consumed calories and nothing about expended calories, also shows a Gray line above the daily consumed calories graph but no explanation of what that number is? Beyond pathetic updates. What a waste to have a samsung watch when the data produced to us is useless"
"Update: Doesn't have enough integration with other apps. Samsung needs to either design more accessories or they should integrate with accessories that meet user needs not currently met by their limited number of accessories. Moved to using other apps largely due to this. Two app integrations that would help me adopt SHealth. Sleep, steps, HR, workouts integration with Withings Healthmate. More detailed integration with Myfitnesspal to show meals."
"REQUIRED 2 step authentication to even use the app now. Dumbest thing to require. Make it optional! Edit since Samsung replied it very bot like way with a bland explanation. Shouldn't need the 2step, it should NOT be required to do. Most of your negative reviews are coming from this recent update. Apparently people don't like the update! I agree with them! I should not need to add a 2step to see my steps. It's unnecessary, and your excuse is lackluster."
"Why does this thing only count steps when you aren't in another app. I Facebook and walk and it shows no steps. This use to be a great way to track steps, but at this point it tells me I walked 2000 steps in a day after a 2 mile walk cause it won't count steps if another app is open then it stalls and 50 steps later is like ""oh ya 13 steps."""
"Doesn't fully load sleep data: as soon as I wake up to go to the bathroom it assumes I'm awake and there's no sleep data for the hours after. Data lacking overall: I can't edit my detected workouts. Interval workouts and crossfit aren't recognised, it splits up my workouts when it's a one hour session overall. No V02 max insight unlike fitbit. I regret buying a Samsung Active watch over Fitbit, which had more function and insight. Samsung also cannot import my years of Fitbit health data."
"I've used this App since I purchased a Samsung Phone over 10 YRs ago. Manufacturer use to be compatible with other devices. I purchased Samsung Gear device to keep up with my history, but as your Gear ages out it no longer works with this App. Disappointed your forcing Consumers to buy your newer Hardware to stay on track with Samsung Health. Now you send me a lot of emails/phone notifications to upgrade from my Note 9. Simply disappointed. Why keep purchasing your Hardware if it ages out"
Use this app multiple times everyday. Very disappointed weight mgmt tool was removed. Also used caffeine to keep track thats gone. Hope put these features back as reviews look like it was well used. 3rd party integration over years slowly disappearing as well.
"This app used to be great. I dont know what happened but every time I try to sign into my account, the app crashes. I've reported it multiple times over the last several months and no changes."
"Ongoing bugs with the social elements for Pixel phones. Been on the phone with customer support 3x already with no solution yet. Update: it's two weeks later, after being told to call in for resolution, and still the same answer. Wait for the next update. Why did you tell me to call in if there is no solution in sight? Waste of time."
"It's a great app to track your sleeping and exercising habits. Would be perfect if sleeping reminder function can be added, as well as increasing the chinese food item in the calories calculation!"
"Samsung Team, please help! This app was perfect, I had everything on it about my fit program, but since my Samsung Galaxy S8 software updated a month ago, it doesn't open now and it keeps saying: can't be opened on a rooted phone. What does that even mean? please help, thanks."
"This is ironically stupid. I desperately tried to connect the mindfulness option but I need to connect with my Samsung account, which I did connected but for some reasons it kept sending me verification code now I am stuck in the loop. I tried to connect with the live chat which only replied me with ""sorry, in Korean only"" for goodness sake thanks a lot Samsung Health, you really helped to grow my stress into something worse."
"App will not open since the latest update on Galaxy S6. Hangs up on sign in screen for Samsung account where I'm already signed in. Tried clearing cache and restart, no help. Not wasting my time with calls. You broke it, just fix it."
"Totally done with Samsung Health. I've used it on several Motorola phones before this new one. Samsung doesn't recognize the fact that the old Samsung phone I had is over a year old, phone has changed and theres virtually no way to login to my account. Stupid. Off to find something else to use. Goodbye once and forever."
"I've been using a galaxy watch active until it broke recently, and I have been v happy with it. So I went and purchased a new active 2 and little did I know they decided to remove the calorie counter on the Samsung Health app. Like. It's baffling to me. HOW. DO. YOU. NOT. KNOW. THAT A HUGE PORTION OF YOUR USERS BUY THE WATCH JUST FOR THAT?! Now I regret having purchased a new galaxy watch active 2. Should've gone with my gut and went for Fitbit instead."
"I don't have anything negative to say so far, But its definitely a must have app. Paired with my watch it helps me see my fitness routine. Kinda forcing me to take care of myself more so. Good stuff üëè My only real problem is the nutrition values aren't right. Like, apple juice definitely has vitamin c in it."
"Ok for tracking steps and activity. But I am a man! So I don't need to track my ""menstrual cycle"" and the Icon that shows on my smartphone home page needs to be a man - not a lady in a pony tail. Seems like the entire app is really only expecting that women or ""others"" will be using it."
I have tried reinstalling the app. Clearing the cache. Checking my phone for updates. I just get the spinning ball of doom any time I try to log in making a lot of the features of my watch useless. Considering returning the watch for a Garmin
great app to keep track of your health and daily workouts or routines but unfortunately the sleep portion of this app is not very detailed and it's the one I use the most. overall though I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good fitness app
Few days ago I rated this app 5 star. But within month i found that when I was traveling by bus the app is keep counting steps in bus also this is the serious issue please work on it. My old comment. First time ever I am giving 5 star to any app. This app is extremely good and it counts perfectly your steps live. The accuracy of counting of the steps is 99.9%. This app is way better than Google fit app.
"Why does the app stop counting my steps? I come back from a walk to find that no steps were counted. This is not the first time this has happened, not to impressed right now. I tried what was recommended, that didn't help.2 nights in a row with no steps counted. Deleting this app."
"Was great. Suddenly stopped syncing with Samsung account after Android update. Now can't access anything. Cleared cache and rebooted, didn't work. Uninstall and reinstall worked."
Removing the detailed heartrate graph seems ridiculous. Only showing min and max over a period seems a bit pointless. In the past I would have given it 4 for the detail data provided.
Used to be great App but now no Weight Management. Can only see daily graph of weight - no longer has the weekly/monthly view options. Please bring this back or its time to dump the watch and App and try fitbit. I'm based in UK so don't give me USA number to call.
Great Tracker for fitness. Tons of helpful tips and videos to keep you on track. Only thing missing is a database with bar code scanner for meals and food.
"Generally gave always been pleased. I use the app for cycling, running g and walking. Recently the step counter continuously fails - even stopping mid walk. It's probably the most useful.part if the app so this is becoming frustrating."
"I wish there more options to see my stats, like year distance, and also better challenges. I am changing to Garmin that offers me more options in the app, but really liked the Samsung watch."
"Samsung, this app is too demanding. All tbe privacy of my phone data which is not related to Samsung health have to be released before we can use your apps. It even demand that we must agree to have your app appear on the top and interfere with other apps. Not good at all."
"I used to love this app but for the last few weeks it's been giving me phantom steps as I sleep. I've woken up to 20,000 steps calculated as I slept and my phone charged. The step counter is the main part of the app that I utilize. I've uninstalled and reinstalled and the same issue persist."
This could be a really good app if the weight managment tool was at least on par with fitbit. With fitbit tool it predicts how many calories you have at the beginning of the day and then adjusts through the day based on activity. With SHealth I wake up and am immediately told I'm 200 calories over even though I haven't eaten anything. SHealth is almost unusable for this feature as it only occassionally tells me what I'll burn through BMR on a seperate screen. Fix this.
1st you automatically update my phone without my consent during the week of my husband's heart surgery/notifications sent from surgeon etc...It took 4 days of me working on everything I could think of to make it return to 'normal'. My carrier said they couldnt do a thing and were waiting on a fix from Samsungü§®üò§ Then this health app Ive used for 4 years and 45lbs is jerking the faithful. We have no rights anymore. I dont believe OR care for any reason or excuse Samsung has. It's pitiful
"You removed trends!! Does not make sense. A figure is only relevant in a relative context .. what is the significance of today's figure in relation to last week's or last month. So that one can see the trend. But you removed it!!! Please bring it back! If you do not, your app is of limited value."
"It's an ok app for keeping track of how many steps you take and how many miles you have walked. Tracking your calories is ok but it solely focuses on your saturated fat, protein, and carb intake. It needs to track everything that is on food labels and also what is in raw fruits and vegetables. My next problem is I am trying to edit my profile so I can track my weight and BMI but my profile never loads so I can't input my height like it says is needed."
"As many other users, I can't sync this app wirh MyFitnessPal anymore! It used to track my steps and update on both platforms. Tried everything from uninstalling, website and support forums. Want the old version back. Don't fix if it ain't broke!"
"Have just updated the app and it now wants access to my contacts and phone. I have read the response from the developer on others that have the same complaint. Says it does not share your info... What a load of rubish... If I want to share my stats with one of my contacts OK, but access to my phone? Just uninstall Ed the app"
"I initially liked the app, and it just deleted all my history, meals, ALL, a years worth of data You add a meal, but when you go fyi add an often, it locks. You have to go out of the app, then back in. I doubt feel like starting from scratch so it's a waste"
"I have a group of 15 family members looking for an app that Apple and Android users can join step challenges. This app is by far my favorite but apple users cannot join challenges. Which makes no sense because they can use the app to track everything. If this app allows Apple users to join challenges it would be the only app to do so. Half of my group currently cannot join my challenge. We must now find another app. You all should fix that to get more users, we loved this app but must switch."
would rate better but the heart rate and stress/oxygen saturation meters don't work well when not moving pressing too hard or talking it suddenly stops registering the finger print scanner and finger positioning this stops the measurement (dev's have responded to figure out the issue)
it's a very good accurate app. with the help of the optional monthly challenge and the community challenges. it's easy to hit and meet your goals whatever they may be.
I deleted the app after using it for yeears after they required unfettered access to my contacts and my files. This level of intrusion is really unacceptable for an app that is supposed to track exercise and food. I am very disappointed that Samsung became so uncomfortably intrusive
Loved until recently updated. Just stuck on the logging page. Now just a useless app! Buyer beware if you don't have a Samsung phone you watch operates in a stand alone mode. No way to track your progress.
"Decent app. There are certain common excersices not listed in the app such as tricep pull downs ect., that should be available as an option. Also there is a tab or option that says fitness that gives you help tips and videos you can follow. However, there is a section that says fitness for women which is great, but it seems like that entire ""fitness"" section is geared for women. How about adding a ""fitness for men"" section?"
"Like most Samsung apps, this app doesn't need to exist. If we must have Samsung health, then it would be a lot better if they enabled sync to Google Fit. The worst thing about this app so far is the favouring of imperial units. Why have everything imperial out of the box when the whole world is metric including South Korea? Why make me change each unit individually instead of having a metric imperial switch? Why can't we use kilojoules at all? Now 1 star due to this terrible reply."
"Samsung decided the app should simply not work unless I agreed to hand over access to all my personal data including my phone records and contacts. It's a shameful invasion of privacy that the app functions just fine for the last 2 years, but Samsung needs more of my personal data to sell to advertisers. /uninstall EDIT. Just updating this comment because Samsung would like to publically tell me they will not do exactly what their terms of use say they will actually do. Stop lieing."
At first i really loved this app.... Very useful..... But suddenly it stopped working... Stopped counting steps..... I have to enter manually... It wont take automatically.... I uninstalled and reinstalled it as well... But still not working.... Kindly fix the issue.
Terrible app. Never works. Just says my phone is rooted. I check the device status and my firmware is official and I sure as hell never rooted my phone. This whole samsung experience is terrible. I will be switching back to Apple soon...
My cheap $40 watch could measure BP. I now have a Samsung S5 and it doesn't. Not so Smart if you ask me.
"Since a recent update, I cant see the graph showing my daily workouts, and even worse ,I am doing the same exercises for the same time, yet being shown, on a the original page only half what I had been doing for the last 3 months ..I have now deleted this app"
"Dear Team, Why doesn't this app works with Samsung Note 9. I am continuosly reaching you regarding this from past 4-5 months and still you are not doing anything. You just gave me a reply that please clear the cache. I mean seriously. Please check your app on Note 9 emulator you will see never ending loading screen while first install (on T&C Agree Screen). Please do something ASAP."
"I used to really like the monthly challenges however recently it stopped counting my steps. After I have been at work for 2 hours which I run a lot at my job it would say I only have 121 steps. It never mattered where it was located it would still count steps. Recently even being in a pocket on my leg, it still is not counting my steps."
"You cannot paste into the password field when creating an account. If you use a password manager to do it anyway, it will act like you didn't enter a password. I literally just want access to the sleep tracking data from my new watch. Infuriating. I'll be returning my brand new Galaxy watch 4. Might consider coming back if Samsung either fixes the account setup, allows using Google fit instead, or allows continuing without an account"
I love this app... I mainly us it for the heart rate - sleep and a few other things. I'm to impatient to keep track of my food and beverages. With my Samsung watch on= continuous monitoring - I can see my heart rate throughout the whole night. I thought that was pretty cool lol.
"0 reason to require phone access. All I want the all for is to check my steps and how long I sleep. No one adds ""friends"" to their fitness apps, stop trying to make everything social media. Scrap the phone permissions or just disable the dumb social function when the permission is denied instead of not allowing people who care about their privacy and the privacy of their friends aren't able to use the app. In the age of constant data breaches I want to give companies less data, not more."
"After the update, when I open the app it freezes and then closes. So it's absolutely useless. Is there another fitness app I can try to transfer my data to so that I don't have to use this one anymore and still not lose my progress?"
"I've always found Samsung health useful and use it daily to track my health. However, I notice that since the last update the recommended daily intake for each nutrient has been removed. I would really appreciate if this feature is made available again."
"I use to be able to measure my pulse, blood pressure, stress level and heart rate by using the finger sensor on the back of my phone and now I can't. I'm not sure if my phone is not compatible with this app or not but if I'm able to put a fingerprint lock on my phone one would assume that I should be able to use this feature in the app unless yall removed the feature of using your finger on the sensor. So did this feature get removed?"
"Constantly getting a ""Session expired"" pop up that wont go away. I have already reset, reinstalled everything and it still wont start. Good job samsung, you made a barely working app into a completely useless one üëèüëè"
Really enjoying the recorded performance and weekly cumulative. I don't need to switch it on to start recording. I can challenge and see friends performance and the Monthly challenge is great.
I have been using this app forever. Now I lose my data because of contacts. I am not giving any app permission to manage phone calls nor access to my contacts. FOR WHAT SAMSUNG!!!!! Big mistake on your part.
"Love this app, always running in my background counting steps. I'm giving it 3 because I'd love if it could do the same automatically with cycling, I walk and cycle through the day and find it annoying to go through the app to start cycling mode. Would be awesome if the app recognize when I'm cycling and record the information"
"Love the app and its integration with my Gear Fit2 watch, but PLEASE bring back the ability to save oximeter readings. I can measure O2 Sat with the stress function, but no longer can save the o2 sat data in the app."
"New requirements .. a privacy issue. I used to love this app but now has stopped. I do not understand why you need full access to my phone. This makes me very uncomfortable from a privacy issue. I loved samsung over apple now I am questioning my choice of phone, earbuds, and watch...maybe apple should be my choice."
"Step count totally incorrect since the last update... as per walking exercise, I did 10k steps. The app only shows 6k on the count. How can the same app show 2 very different counts at 2 different place? Please fix it!"
"Was fine until they required to give call permissions. If it's need for the ""together"" feature, they could disable the feature for people who don't want Samsung to access all calls etc. Not recommended"
"I have no problems with the samsung app itself, I have issues with my watch. It does not count my steps correctly, I completed a 5k walk the other day and I did it in 500 steps...obviously this is rubbish! Some days I only do 2000 which I know is not right as I run after my kids all day"
I used to use this app to track my weight management and I lost over 50 lb using it. Now that this has been removed I only use it to track my exercise. I've been forced to download and use MyFitnessPal which actually works out pretty well to track and manage my weight. With the weight management included on Samsung health it's a 5 plus star rating without the weight management it's less than one star.
"I can't sign in to my Samsung account on this app on my pixel 4a. I can sign in to the watch app on this phone but not the health app. I've tried everything, I just get a spinning circle and it never actually signs in. I uninstalled, tried synching in settings, cleared everything but it will not work. I am going to return my watch if this isn't solved"
"Use to be good but now it seems to report incorrectly. I walked for ~76min it says I did 91min, I did 4.06 miles it says I did 5.08 miles and it says I burnt 1732 kcal which is way too high for 9979 steps which another app reports only 7232 steps (285 kcal). The prevoius version reported more accurately. Not sure if there is a way to manually recalibrate the app."
Used to work ok on my Android. It now crashes often since I updated today to the new interphase. I cleared cache and still crashes when I swipe up to view page as of October 7th. Still no fix in updates
Since the last update I have been unable to use the app. It keeps prompting me to allow permissions in settings. I have updated all permissions and still can not use the app.
Recently this app has gone down in my opinion- it doesn't sync well anymore with my active 2 watch so not all my steps get recorded properly... Especially with the challenges! Very aggrevating.
Why it take so much time to sync activity to Strava service? I use this app with Galaxy Watch and I have to wait for a day or two to get it sync. Fix it please! My friend Garmin watch using Garmin Connect and it's working very well with Strava service. I'm considered to move to Garmin because of this!!!
"Total nonsense that I have to buy a watch in order to use the Samsung health apps, I'm already paying for the phone. Dumb ""upgrade"". If I would have known that I would have kept my s10, instead of getting an s21. Samsung is getting as bad as Apple..."
"Constantly bricks itself demanding permissions that are not required for functionality. Update: what features needed to be implemented after the update, when the app was working fine. It was installed and working since December, and now in April I can't log in."
"Recently I have migrated from iPhone to Samsung, Many people said to me that Samsung health application is better than Apple Health. I disagree, i used this application for 20days and I have see that when I am traveling in my car it's tracking steps and steps are added to subtotal. usually I would logout at 11:40pm from office at 12:20am when I reach home I see 500 steps. I was overexcited that I am completely daily challenge but had no idea that when I am traveling in a car It counts steps."
Unable to resieve sms
Latest release removed a lot of functionality. Where is weight management and the caffeine managed item?!?! This app is worst now. The 2 step authentication doesnt work with the latest version. This app has gone way down hill. Roll back to the early 2020 version.
step count totally inaccurate. I just got a new Samsung Galaxy S10 and the step count is way off. the Galaxy S7 counted steps properly. I run 4 miles regularly and it only counts about 5800 steps. is this a software or hardware issue? I run with my phone in my hand.
Does NOT work correctly on non Samsung phones. Samsung customer service is a joke. Please replace your robot replies with human replies. I am more annoyed now than when I originally reported a problem. 10 replies I am still non the wiser. When will Samsung realize most of us are not computer experts. Instructions should be clear and simple . Seeing as they cannot fix the steps app as it only works when it decides to they should call me but they came up with an excuse for that too. Call me!
"Good app when it doesn't freeze up. The Together bit only updates my score when it feels like it, sometimes only every few days. And the step counter has locked up twice in the last fortnight."
"During the two-step verification process, a code is sent to my cell phone, but when I enter the code the 'Verify' button does not light up and I am unable to click it in order to proceed. It subsequently times the code out and that's it. Could I please get some help with that?!!"
"I hope it connected with diet program! I'm starting intermittent fasting with an app called Fasting Tracker. But it is integrated only with google fit. Or else.. please make this app to have a dietary program ,Not only to calculate calories and the work out program."
Not enough functionality Lets say there are systems that track your floors climbed and distance walked or cycled and etc but this one does not do that for my purposes I found it as a complicated pedometer with a notebook. Honestly try to put the steps climbed as well
"I'm absolutely fan of SH. 1 thing I missing in SH is workout with heart rate control, it's must have option is missing in the app. Please add heart rate control in workouts, it so much necessary for long distance runners. Thx"
"I used to enjoy this app, I'm changing my starts from 4 to 1..it would be zero if I could give it. Due to the recent update I now own a worthless Samsung Galaxy watch that I can't see app info for. So ignorant to do in the middle of a challenge. Second, I don't want your blanket feedback stating my info won't be shared. Can you guarantee me no one will hack you? Very disappointing"
Can't open the app on my Note9. Gives an error message about not opening on a rooted device. My phone is not rooted. I'd like to see the info my watch has been tracking. Update today did not fix. Very inconvenient.
Loved using this app for tracking health data until the last update when Samsung significantly reduced the capabilities. No longer tracks the things I used it most for like tracking calorie deficit goals. Very disappointed.
"Nowadays the saving sleep time does not appear in the notification, I request to bring it back. I also set permission to ignore do not disturb but it doesn't work. I really like that!"
"very useful and has helped me lose a lot of weight but need more options, more challenges would be fun and a weight management system to include cheat day and more weekly focused dieting would be nice but for what it is it's great for tracking steps and daily calories"
"used to love it but they take features away (oxygen level trending) that folks are using. make me wonder what else they will take away which leads me to look for other apps since other features I use may also go away. really poor customer service .... even their on line help didn't know it was removed. poor...poor....poor. Guess I'll stick with my Fitbit tracker since Samsung Health has no advantage anymore  Their response didn't take into account my comments.  I know I can measure oxygen levels ....however, you can NO LONGER SEE THE TRENDING (in my first line above)."
"Generally good app with good data transfer from my Galaxy Active 2 watch. However, my watch does not detect when I go to sleep and the data transferred is therefore inaccurate."
They removed the weight tracking feature which calculated how many calories you needed to consume based on your activity and food. It was an awesome 3-in-one tool. Makes me regret my Samsung watch!
"Unable to read Oxygen level. Heart rate is only accurate approximately 75 % of the time, while using watch. Phone doesn't read anything using my finger. Extremely disappointed. This is one of the main reasons I bought the newest & best Samsung phone and watch."
"It is absolutely unacceptable that an embeded health application requires your phone number to run. Actually Samsung limits functionality of the phone by this. That's one of the reasons why I am not planning to buy any new samsung device, since samsung considers it may force me to do something against my will, or deprive me from limiting permissions of an app (e.g. bixby), etc. Good bye. PS: Thank you Samsung for the irrelevant reply..."
"Why do you suddenly need access to my phone? If this is needed for a specific feature it should be called out and let us opt out of it. I haven't needed it thus far. If this requirement isn't removed in an update soon, then I'll be forced to uninstall the app and seek a different health tracking ecosystem."
Do not like the redesign. Confusing and not clear to me. Everything is difficult to find and navigate. Go back to prior version make this easier to use. Bad dog!
"Like using galaxy watches but what is with this lackluster, featureless app with no improvements? It's pathetic it would be fair to state this app had better utilities and features a few years ago. Also, inb4 useless customer supports generic response. Those clowns clearly don't actually listen to customer feedback. Shame..good watch. Awful software."
"I used to enjoy this app but it has changed recently. It has connectivity issues with my Motorola edge, it glitches, disconnects unexpectedly, and I'm not getting timely messaging info from mail and text."
"About a 8 months with each update the app got worse, now there is no more pace coach, which was an excellent part of the app. Seems to be quite inaccurate now as well as far as steps or distance is concerned. I liked pace coach but now that it's gone I'll be switching to different health app."
"The together community is a bit of a joke. You've got people that are somehow able to walk 90 miles a-day only to be given the number one ranking. They follow up this 90 mile trek by walking 85 miles the following day, this is impossible but Samsung does nothing, but reward them with the 1st place prize. Step counter is about 15 too high for my part, but can be adjusted. Calorie counter is also a bit of a joke! Overall there are better apps out there... use something else, samsung missed."
Units of measurement for food is in grams. I love my Samsung watch but the fitbit app is much better. I can say I had a cup of something or 2 slices of bacon. In this app I'm measuring by grams. I don't have time to carry a scale. May have to go back to fitbit. I just want to track my food üò©
"Love the app, even though today it started freezing up. Now I can't access recent workouts or start a new one. Still love the information it provides me and the ""together"" challenges."
"They legit just got rid of the best thing they had, which was the weight measurement. It let you know if you had want above and are below you calories daily intake. Thanks to that feature I was able to loose 14 pounds in like 1 month and a few days."
"i like this app and its quite easy to use and track, however one thing is really really annoying me. I cant manually set my caffeine intake. Not sure if I just dont know how to do it, but it only gives me the option for the average amount in coffee. I had less mg of caffeine than a cup of coffee and its really irritating me. I just want to put in my own number."
"The much touted ""blood pressure"" and ""ECG"" features open a browser pointing to a Samsung play store (which is inaccessible on a non Samsung phone). I have Samsung Health from the Google play store installed and Blood Pressure and ECG will not work with it (other parts of Samsung Health do work) Also, doesn't auto detect cycling - which Google does for my timeline, so it can't be that difficult"
"Pedometer doesn't work at all. I followed the instructions to the tee and it still won't count my steps. I also followed the directions under the FAQ section, but neither one made a difference. BIG mistake. I'm uninstalling it NOW"
CAN'T EVEN LOG INTO THE APP ANYMORE. It auto fills the 6 digit verification code sent by text message and still has the audacity to claim the verification code is wrong. Contacted Samsung a month ago. They've shown no interest in replying to me or fixing the problem. An online search told me I'm not the only one who can't log in due to being forced into two factor verification and that simply not working. Really pathetic. Next phone and watch will not be Samsungs.
Can't get past startup page. Two advert / notification settings marked as optional are displayed but 'next' brings up a warning about settings and I can't find a setting that stops this happening.
"I used to love this app, but this latest update took out the O2 sats other than with the stress measurement. the stress measure takes too long and is not convenient. PLEASE bring the sats back as a separate choice with the heartrate."
This review is from a future 7th grader! In half a month I will be going back to school. And I decided to look after my health! This app has helped me so much! I am also planning to get a fitness clock (if that's what you call it) I've been feeling a lot better with this app and it is really simple and easy to use! So a 5 star from me!
"With the newest update, you cannot use the app unless you grant permission for it to make and receive phone calls. There is zero reason a fitness app should need to call anyone. Deleted. I guess there's no need for me to buy that new Watch3 for sleep and fitness tracking either then."
It was pretty useful until a recent update. I have been using a graph with weekly number of steps for several years and it is gone now. Why good functionality is taken out with an update while lots of useless functions are added???
Frickin irritated by its auto pause features. I had to record my 15km run and 50km bicycling for two virtual awareness programmes but when I finished the event and looked at my phone it had auto paused and didn't record 90 percent of my run. Damn you Samsung team.
"Don't like the new Weight function since the last update, prev. version had a Weekly/Monthly view which was much better than the Daily view currently on offer! Would prefer that option returned in the next update please."
"I'd give 2.5 stars but can't. The food added often times does not have the correct nutritional information and it doesn't track all the information for nutrition. There is no way to mark any health concerns which could change the activity and food intake. No way to add other activities like housework, gardening and other physical activities. I'd really like to track more of what I do but this is not helpful. What if a person recently had surgery and was in restrictions, that couldn't be tracked"
Your new upgrade to your app as of today is not ADA compliant when used in dark mode. The clock when setting the work out time is white and the numbers are barely visible on the clock to someone without a disability.
Since the latest update you can no longer check your stress and heat levels.
"Unlike Google Fit, Samsung is able to reliably track my distance. Great feature! Unfortunately the new update does not let me sign in when I skip the 2FA setup. ERROR Net Name Not Resolved."
I was able to sycn the data from my Active Watch to Samsung Health and used the steps data for my Healthy 365 apps. But somehow since 1st October. Something changed and now it cannot be sync at all. Whats happening? Very disappointed.
"Seriously annoyed. I have been struggling to sign into the app for weeks now, with no luck. I spent a small fortune buying a Samsung watch, which is basically useless now since I cannot track my steps, exercise etc on the app. And seems like I'm not the only one complaining? What is going on?"
I really use to like the cell phone app. Nice large easy to read numbers. It use to aslo track 10 minute continuous workouts. My latest update is terrible. Please bring back old version!!
"Unable to open anymore. Having used the app since 2018 it no longer works anymore after a recent update, just an error code then kicked out, probably because i refused to accept samsung have access to my calls - a physical activity app doesn't need access to calls. Dont usually give 1 star reviews, but considering how big companies handle personal data inthe spotlight this is a surprising update samsung - what were your devs/policy makers thinking. Reading the reviews - I'm not only one. Shame."
"Only just got the app because I was told I needed the health app to use the ecg on my watch 4 and the link the watch sends is not working. And then spent a literal half a fkng hour trying to get this trash app that frankly has less stuff on it that the fffkn watch does, including making a poshht account. This was absolutely broken and infuriating to set up that I nearly rage quit it twice. So much for my happy mood and excitement over this new watch. Oh. And the ecg still doesn't work."
Good fun. Can be a bit erratic at times. Steps/distance has a mind of its own and occasionally the app as a whole sulks and records nothing. Helps stop me vegetating! Seems to work better on the Sony Xz1 compact.
"If I update the app to any of the latest versions, It just doesn't open, and stays on loading screen forever. Therefore, It is unusable. EDIT: The version suggested by Samsung (6.15.1) also does not pass the login screen"
"Since the recent update the step counter won't sync properly between my Galaxy Fit and the app. Update: no, I won't call an international number to report an app problem. It's the 21st century, there must be more convenient ways to solve it."
"Since the latest update this app won't let me in at all. It tells me to sign into Samsung acc which I have already done. When I try again it just says ""Account already exists in Account Manager"" and it still retains the screen that won't let me in. I've tried a hundred times to no avail."
"I used to really like this app, but after the last update it no longer works at all. I have set up the 2 stwp verification and agreed to the privacy notice, but it will not allow me to continue any farther."
Really love this app i have been using this app for more then two year. initially bit issue was there but after few updates never faced any issue.Really fulfill a tracker need. We can connect friends and many more fabulous to do. Thanks
"Since the latest update, my exercise tracking keeps pausing for no reason and doesn't resume automatically. Very frustrating. Bring back the old version!"
I love this app. I use the Galaxy S9 and I also use the Samsung Gear Fit 2 Pro watch and the two work seamlessly together. I have recommended it to others and will continue to do so. whenever I have had an issue I use the chat option in the gear app and they are perfect real time help. I would like to suggest that the help features I have used on the Samsung Gear App should be on the Samsung Health App and be on the home screen of this app (still 5 stars without it though)
Can't get past the two step verification page. How this release passed production testing? Bad quality control! Since you can't reply to a dev comment I will just do an edit and keep my rating at 1 star. That is literally what all the 1 stars are telling you. You cannot get past the 2 factor auth! It is literally it is an endless loop. You do the phone number and enter the code in. We know that...
"Not sure why but on the app for the Galaxy Watch 4, GPS tracking isn't available for outdoor activities like kayaking, canoeing and outdoor ice skating. Hope this gets fixed in an upcoming app update."
"I use this app to track heart rate and stress levels. It would be nice to add pregnancy mode, since it is known that heart rate can increase dramatically during pregnancy and currently the app records it as 'high stress' when it is not necessarily the case."
Even if you dont have a Samsung smart watch you can still use this with no problem only thing is that you have to have your phone with you 24/7. My only complaint is that it does not have a dark mode compatibility. Other than that it is the best app I've used on Android ü§ô
"Bought a Galaxy Watch 4, i have a Galaxy S9+ The Samsung health app gets stuck loading each time i press the agree to the privacy notice button. I tried reinstalling, clearing cache, soft reset, repairing and nothing works. This app just made my watch completely useless.. good job samsung."
Nice and simple app for an active person who doesn't require any fancy apps meant for athletes. It's somewhat entertaining to check my daily activity every evening. I also enjoy those sleep time stories and other stuff that make you relaxed before going to bed Every now and then I have found them useful to myself.
"I really like the app, check it daily for progress on challenges. would be nice if the cheaters in the monthly challenges could be easily botted out of existance. But hey as long as there is a race someone somewhere is gonna find a way to say they ran 80 miles per hour for 24 hours."
"I bought a galaxy watch 3 with the ECG in mind only to find out that you have to also have a galaxy phone to get ""Samsung health monitor"" in order to use it. There's also a workaround to get the ECG working on non galaxy phones, so I know it's not an issue with hardware. I contacted Samsung and they told me to ""get a galaxy phone"" I'm not going to buy a new phone to get one feature of the watch working. Unless this is fixed promptly I will not buy or recommend Samsung."
"Wonderful app. My only beef is that it doesn't seem to allow the recording of interrupted sleep. I almost never sleep straight through the night and would love to record as much. If I'm wrong and it does allow this but I'm just being a bit dim, then I'll be back to eat some crow and flush out the full 5 stars."
"The experience and ui of the app is good although i think it lacks home screen widgets for its functions. A widget should be added for heartrate trends, sleep tracking and others and a larger widget that brings together multiple into one"
"I like the app, but they got rid of their calorie tracking programs like the calorie burned balance tracker. I no it's not super accurate but it gave me a good estimation on when I should eat and work out."
"Always like the App until the new update.i want notifications but i don't want them to Stay @ the top of my screen in the notification bar, i should be able to swipe then away or open them & they show disapeer. since the new update i can't get rid of the notification."
"I liked it before the latest updates where you could see weight by day, week and month with averages and high and low. Now you can only see it by day so useful functions have been removed!"
"This application was great and very useful for me, but since the latest update it becomes almost useless without Weight Management section. I'm so disappointed, how am I supposed to manage my weight and maintain balance?? Please consider returning this section back."
"It worked great until the recent update. It stopped counting my steps; all the challenges have disappeared, and it won't synch with my Samsung watch at all."
"Loved this app, this update ruined it. 1 all my history is gone over the last number 5 I think years worth. 2. You do not need my birthday for anything. 3. I would not be reloading any of my contacts or private information if I lost my phone from this ap, that is so ridiculous. 4. Angered me that no warning or notice that anything was changing. Now it does not work correctly. Sorry Uninstalling. If you go back to the way it was may consider re installing."
"GARBAGE.....!!!!!!! Gets half way through a heart or stress test and tells me to center my finger. My finger couldn't be anymore centered if i had a bullseye on it....... By the time i get done trying to use it, I don't need it to check my stress level cause it's through the roof from this app....."
I cannot open app period. So cannot use it. All permissions are allowed still unable to open it asks to try later or retry I have done both. I have cleared cache and data a few times restarted phone nothing works have tried for weeks. What can be done? I have a samsung watch and would love to use the app.
"What happened to ""Sleep Efficiency"" ? When it showed how you slept, motionless, light and restless? I had to go back to the older version before this. Went back few months so the app will work like I want it to. Fix the update"
"[Edited 2] When I use the running coach feature in no location services, my pace remained at 0.00 even when I am already moving. However, when I used the running basic workout with no location, the pace worked just fine. How can I fix this? Thanks. I will give 3 stars for now."
"Was great but now this garbage insists on accessing my phone to make/rcv calls and force twofactor authorization. it wont even let me in because i denied in calling permission. I only use it to record data from my smartwatch, now i can go back to the regular watch. it does not need to access my phone to call or answer calls."
Its a great app i love it. I compete to my self to get better score every time and Every challenge... Unfortunately so disappointed for the guys that cheated on this app.. Whats the point to do 200K steps a day. You are not fooling anyone. Is not possible. Hoping to those guys their false. fake life good luck .and that Makes them happy. Thanks for the app
I really want to love this app but it is so inaccurate. It said I need half the calorie intake my nutritionist recommended for me to improve my low BMI. I can't find any way to customize food so my meal tracking is inaccurate also. For example the brand of crackers I eat is not listed and has different nutritional value than the brand that is listed. Is there no way to add food to the list? Why can't customize workout either? I had to select Boxing for playing with my dog. Stupid limitations
"What happened. Upgraded from note5 to note20 ultra. None of the items such as stress or blood pressure no longer work. Previously, you select item then place your finger over the blinking light where the camera was located."
I really liked the app at first. It worked pretty good. also the first time using an app of this nature. what killed it is that it wants access to my phone and contacts. um no you have no reason to need that info. Uninstalled it since I couldn't use it unless it got the access. bad business tactics. getting sick of Samsung frl
"Was good untill it got shady, quit working after an update and had to clear data then it wanted as a main permission to be able to make and manage phone calls and an optional permission for counting steps. As an app used for health (counting steps and such) having tjat as optional and forcing them to be allowed to make phonecalls with your # is NOT ok we need to be better people or the world will rot"
"Unnecessary permissions and unnecessary mandatory processes that you can't even skip - granting file access, 2-step verification. Useless app and really poor accuracy of gps on their watches. Regretting buying their smartwatch."
I enjoy using the App espicially the challenges. It would be nice to select my friends in the challenges that was available to me before. Now the friends I used to see on the app is no longer there.
"Great easy to use app. Only suggestion I have seen noted earlier was that the meals should be in time order, not main meal order, and to also have the option to scan barcodes for foods as I have trouble finding some foods some times"
"Complete garbage, stuck in an infinite 2step authetification loop, can't use my smart watch - thank you samsung"
"Its so lousy, i walk 5km in distance and the steps shows 1K only, to make sure if something wrong in the apps, I install another apps it shows i taken 10k steps, I cross check with this apps it still shows 2K steps, i use different phone also still same. Its not showing correct steps."
"I DO NOT WANT/ NEED YOU TO RECEIVE OR MAKE CALLS ON MY BEHALF! Yes, I seen party line response u give when someone complains about it. Absolutely RIDICULOUS!! I don't buy it. I had no probs b4 update- thought it was great. It's insane app NEEDS permission 2 answer calls in order for us to use it. You don't give option 2 bypass permission- I'd rather use app b4 update! Looks like I'll b looking 4 another health/ tracking app!"
"Good but needs alot of improvement. I'm counting carbs and it won't show me my current carb count. I wish it would let me set my own daily nutritional requirements according to my doctor (not doctor samsung). The custom foods Iron is wonky. It shows a different amount in the daily intake than what I actually punch in in the custom food. Also in the custom foods for the vitamins, let us choose either a percentage or a weight (mg, mcg, ect) and show it as the weight as well as the percentage. Thx"
"I love this app!! I've had my Note 8 for 2 years now and I never thought I'd ever use Samsung Health, but I bought a Samsung Galaxy watch and now it's my most used app!! I've made my friends use it too, it's made a huge difference in motivating us to get in shape and an excellent distraction from this Coronavirus lockdown debacle!!"
"Great until I installed update. Will not work unless you give permission for app to make phone calls but once given, you cannot change permission in settings. Will be finding another app. Access yo phone is not necessary for functionality of a fitness app."
This used to be my daily driver since 3 years. Even though the records are updating but now the personal records wont sync. Its only taking stats from my galaxy watch and not from my Android app. Please look into this.
"this was a great app until Samsung broke it, now I get the rooted error even after trying all the fixes. scanned my S8 phone for viruses and malware and its clean. I have lost all faith in Samsung customer service and my next phone will be from another company!!"
Was welling well until the last update. Now it is constantly crashing.
I used to be able to easily track my stress level / have it auto detected if high. Now I cannot find the setting to measure. Please make this easily accessible again.
It is a very good app with some flaws. It is very slow at updating steps with other people and when I redownload it and re enter my data it struggles to find my account multiple times.
Since 1 Oct 2021 Samsung Health is unable to sync with Healthy 365. Is Samsung health not compatible with Healthy 365? Do allow Samsung Health to sync with this 3rd party app as I've been using it with Samsung Watch to complete challenges. If it can't then the Samsung watch is useless now. üòí
I love the app for all its health metrics showing in detail. I am disappointed with not able to sync my samsung health data with google fit which all other health apps support it. Please bring this feature to support google fit to samsung health app.
I love all the areas for help and the health watch. What I have a problem with is that you can not enter exercise manually. I lift weights and it doesn't keep track of calories burned like Lifesum does. üòî
"I couldn't edit my original 1 star review, so I'm making a new one. I originally gave it 1 star, due to the latest update causing the app to not allow me to get past the 2 step verification process. I decided to call the Samsung customer service, and I was walked through a series of steps on my phone: go to settings. Then apps. Click on Samsung health app. Make sure that permissions were allowed for the app. Clear the cache. Then shut phone off for 1 minute and then turn back on. Now it works!"
It was great to start off with now the app is always off I have given permission and body senses on but it's not picking anything up other then fake step by holding the phone. Just uninstalled it and downloaded it again seems to be working now.
"Great app with lots of functionalities and very user friendly interface. As future improvements I would suggest to support bar codes for food tracker, and to allow setting up a typical coffee item for the caffeine tracker, so that when you log your caffeine you are also logging the coffee in your food tracker"
"I'll make you a deal.... Describe in explicit detail how and what your doing with the new permissions ""to provide a better overall experience"" and I'll keep the app. Otherwise I'll keep continuing to encourage others to find something less intrusive, less copy-pasta and CERTAINLY more useful"
A strong argument could be presented that this app saved my life. I've lost 40 pounds in the last 10 months and a lot of the credit goes to the caloric tracking that using this app has allowed me to accomplish! Thanks a ton!
I just try to redownload the app and reset up my account and it was like pulling teeth from a rhinoceros. I had to do the two set verification three times reset my password two times and I've deleted it now once. I'll choose a different app.
The together function is broken. There is no way someone is walking 63 miles a day to win the challenges.
My experience with my smart watch is just fine.I like the fact that whenever I try to be lazy it reminds me to keep moving. Good idea. So my only concern is that no matter how much I click stairs it doesn't count. Any idea what I should do to correct this problem ü§î? Just asking ü§î! Overall I like my smart watch. Thanks.
"Used to use this all the time, but unable to access it at all. It says the privacy policy has been updated, but I need to change my settings to allow me to use this feature. I changed my permissions and am still locked out of the app."
Updated app is completely unusable. It now requires 2FA to log in but won't let me verify my phone. I called the tech support number and it'll be 24-48 hours until it's resolved. What a bunch of BS. A company like Samsung should be able to put out a quality app without these kinds of bugs.
Sleep time are off one hour after daylight saving starts. Please fix it. I will change the rating afterward. Thank you! I'd also like to keep all workouts history instead only 30 days.
"So happy with the update, but i have been having problems syncing with MyFitnessPal it would be great if the food dairy was up dated, it could use a Scanner, there are a few thing that could be updated"
Old versions were brilliant and really user friendly. The fact it won't now connect to 3rd party apps means I can no longer user the app. I do not understand why Samsung have taken such a step backwards.
"Before the app was updated, I would give it 5 stars! Now with the update, I have to add one food item at a time, close out the app and clear cache, then go back and add another item. It's time to eat another meal by the time I get one meal entered. Please fix or just take us back to previous version."
I just Can't get in the account. It is not sending the message for the code. It just made MY watch useless!! Update: after this review they sent the code in minutes....i had been trying to sign in for several days. But at least it s resolved
The app is broken. It will not let me get passed the two step verification page. The issue seems to be a common problem after a quick Google search but they haven't attempted to fix anything
I have a Samsung Galaxy Book 360 Pro and I really wish there was a Windows version of this app. It's really difficult to try to do the awesome exercise/stretch routines on my tiny phone screen.
"Was working fine until last update of Samsung software. Now - Can't connect to external heart rate monitor (garmin chest strap) Otherwise it's an OK app to keep simple tally of what your activities are. Update. Garmin chest strap can't be connected anymore, it was even removed from list of accessories. Can someone explain what is going on? Looks like we are being forced to buy another product (for no apparent reason) to monitor heart rate."
"Updat:Im UK,you ask to call US! Buggy app, poor devs & being ignored by customers service. They introduced a password that I set up and now can't get back to the app, it's locked, bugged. Can't reset without loosing all my data. Contacted Samsung CS - they want me to backup my data then reset the app, which doesn't work anyway. What a hassle while they block MY data. Ridiculous incompetence of devs and management. Contacted Samsung app directy: no response. My next phone will be iPhone or Huawei."
Complete trash. Trying to obtain extra user data that it doesn't need and doesn't provide any value compared to other fitness trackers. Can't sync with Google fit.
"I like this app but, I test some exercise in it. I see that it works on moving of mobile. I like this idea but you have to upgrade its working mode not like moving of mobile. I mean to say that it will have to work like yes 'we are doing the exercise.' Sometimes some people swing in air their mobile and calories are counted. So you have to update the idea and working mode of it. Thankyou for this app. I hope you will upgrade (update) this app soon."
Sleep data is amazing! I did not expect the data to be easily understandable or useful (FitBit is my comparison). The 7 day and 30 day report trends are useful.
"Really wish the step count was more accurate. Also more acurate activity options, such as weight lifting. The app. also seems more geared to women. Please, more discovery options for us guys."
"Over the last 3 days app is showing that I've burnt mega calories, what's your problem you may ask however I dont think Ussain Bolt burns 28000 in a day!last night whilst sleeping I burnt 16000 - pretty sure I didn't sleep run a marathon! I sent a system report to samsung health and attached a screenshot to get a message back asking for more details and a screenshot üôÑ Up to 3 days ago I loved this app - the low star is to hopefully grab their attention to fix this error."
I having a error in the samsung health app. My steps are recorded in home but not in the competition. No matter how much I walk the steps doesn't increase. Do I need any external device or app to count my steps so that it can be added to competition.
"I absolutely loved this app when I had my galaxy, I've now switched to a Huawei and can't get on with their health app so I was delighted to find out that you can get s health on any android device. It won't let me sign in and recover my old data but I'm happy to start anew. Brilliant app!"
I wish progress and settings could be saved and transferred from one Samsung phone to another. Lost all my info but I love the tracking ability of my exercise routines to my intake of water.
Love the new dark mode. Would be great if I could change the auto-detect work out type. I recently had one save as cycling when it was definitely a walk and can't find any way to change it.
Cannot change the scale of the sleep chart.
"Screen/app won't stay open to allow me to view any information on my phone Rather than call you, can't you give me an answer why your app shuts down immediately? So frustrating after the amount of money that was spent on the phone and watch. Great way to lose a long time customer."
"Good app to track down vital health mesurements. However, provision to record and analyze body temperature, blood pressure, 02 saturation and stress now measured almost daily in this time of pandemic, appears noticeably missing. Adding this to the app in future improvements would be excellent."
"Where is the ECG feature? My Galaxy watch 4 keeps prompting me to download something called Samsung Health Monitor. However, that app apparently is not published by Samsung in the Google Play store, and is only available for Samsung Galaxy phones. This feels blatantly misleading. I'm on a Pixel 6 which has the ability to securely store data locally, so what gives? And even if I don't want to store the ECG, just to view it, I can't if I don't own a Galaxy phone? That is absolute nonsense."
"Okay so issue was not adressed at all, some redundant information was shared. The app has a CRITICAL BUG and preventing me to even log in. It redirects back to the login page every single time. The helpline number is always busy. Just an acknowledgement of the bug and a promise to fix it in a future update is all I'm asking jeez samsung."
The update has removed the video auto play when you tap on the vid prior to pressing play. It's a feature that I personally liked and found useful.
Walked 2.2 miles yesterday and it gave me 3987 steps. Walked 3.3 miles today and it gave me 3267 steps. It used to be much more reliable in counting steps than it is now. Sometimes it goes as low as 2500 for the 2.2 miles. Other than that I like the rest of the app.
"Excellent insight to health, whether through activity/workout monitoring, sleep monitoring, weight tracking - it does well at it all. The ""Together"" activities where you reach to achieve goals with people all over the world, are encouraging and help with setting (and hopefully achieving) goals."
"Very bad experience. Pedometer not counting steps. No solution only experimenting to run app. Don't install. I have done all the setting and resetting, but the problem is still same."
"I don't even use it. They want this app to be a stand alone in an era when all the big fitness apps are linked. Strava, Nike, garmin, all have better ways of syncing activity. I have a garmin watch, which is better then galaxy watches and it loads my activities to garmin. Run activity to nike. All fitness activities to strava...perfect!"
5 star for whole app experience. Problem: Together challenging feature credibility issue. Being a world's top Apple counter company Samsung has responsibility to control together mode steps. It is a biggest bogus feature in Samsung. Samsung come forward and correct wrong leaders. How come a person walks 200k steps in 1st day or 2nd day. Is it possible in real world?? If Samsung does not plans to correct or control it better to remove that feature rather than uninspiring.
"I've used this app for years and I really enjoy it for tracking my workouts. But, as of yesterday it won't let me open my workout info. The app stops working. Is this an update issue? Or is there something I can do to fix it. I don't want too uninstall the app, I'm afraid I'll lose my previous workout information."
"It doesn't let you edit a workout after it has been recorded. Major drawback, lets say you ran a 5k on a treadmill and the app registered it as 4.5k, you have no options of correcting it."
I used this app faithfully until the update. I disabled the app after being disappointed with the updated version. I can not find where to change the email associated with the app.
"Just bought galaxy watch so I could use Samsung health. App wouldn't work on my A70. Looked at recent reviews on play store and it looks like all A70 users lost ability to use S health with the June 2020 software update. I'll be returning my galaxy watch within the month if Samsung doesn't remedy this. Called all Samsung support lines and told nothing they could do to fix at present. Come on Samsung, stand by your customers and get on fixing this."
Have been enjoying this app for some time and had no issues with it. Now accessing phone and contacts is required and that's a big no. Their explanation for why is completely insufficient and not warranted. Now going to look for other options.
"Ive tried many other apps, even premium ones. This app is spot on with Calorie tracking and the database is humongous! If you have a samsung watch it gets even better! Its just such a good all in one solution and even if you use other apps for certain function you can link most popular apps to Samsung Health and it still stays central."
"There is an opportunity to keep and give flexibility esply if i want to capture say rounds of Surya namaskar, app should roughly calculate cal. Secondly, if i need to make some key notes on daily page i.e. cold shower or taking medicines, it doesn't have custom options."
"Bring back sleep reminder. I'm not sure why this app keeps being changed, it was functioning well enough, then you remove the oxygen saturation and now no sleep reminder, I've already missed a day since the last update."
What a lovely app. It is really so helpful and make it easy to track many features concerning health. I really would like you to add a mean to measure body temperature. It will so wonderful especially at these risky moments regarding the world-wide spread of COVID-19. Thank you.‚ô•Ô∏è
This was a great app utill it tried to force me to allow the app to make and manage phone calls. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?! ***Answering the reply*** There is NO WAY ON THE PLANET that I am giving Samsung access to everything on my phone. That is ridiculous. I had a 5-star rating on this app. It should be my choice if I want additional features or need them. I DON'T. Put it back the way it way and get your nose out of my private life.
"I wish I could edit the workouts that are automatically detected with my watch. I took a walk with my son in his stroller yesterday and it read as my cycling because my hands were stationary instead of moving, as if I were on a bike. I wanted to be able to edit the workout and change it in the Samsung Health App but because I can't, I just had to make a note."
"Worst app update ever. Locked out of the app only to find that users now require a Samsung account to log back in. After doing so, find out the app has been stipped of it's best features. 5 star app before this update, pls roll back the update. UPDATE: Stopped using the app since the privacy policy update. No way I intend to provide access to manage calls. Can't see how that has any relation to tracking health and fitness. Currently shopping for a new app."
"For the last two months I haven't been able to sync Samsung health with the Myfitnesspal app. Up till then, I love the app and used it daily. It was very discouraging try to figure out what went wrong and now the app is useless for my health journey."
"I enjoy using Samsung Health to see how I am progressing on exercising, weight, weight & appetite management, sleep, heart rate, oxygen. I have finally tried the challenges. I made it after a knee injury 2 years ago. Next goal to lose weight I have been want to keep off for the last 20 years. I know what to do I just need to put my thoughts in motion. Good luck to new beginnings at the age of 50."
"I bought a phone with heart monitor I can not use unless I hand insane amount of access rights to an app. Create a bunch of passwords. All so Samsung can track your private information. I am not interested to share my private information with you. I already do with google. Either create an app to use the heart monitor. Or remove it from your ""features"". I paid for a crazy expensive phone that has less features than my old modest phone. I won't buy Samsung again unless you solve this issue."
"The Pulse Rate is not reflected properly on the Watch Face on my Galaxy Watch 4. Samsung health app is not providing the data it should (icon, text with value), and it only provides a static red heart icon. I am using Thema's Face titled Advanced Watch Face & Clock Widget. More Info:Currently, the used type is "" TYPE_SMALL_IMAGE"", which can only provide an image. This is why only a red heart is displayed. In order to be useful to any user, the type of the ""heart rate"" complication should be of type 3 TYPE_SHORT_TEX, but should provide the last read value when calling ""ComplicationData.getShortText()"", and an icon (like the red heart) when calling ""ComplicationData.getIcon()""."
This watch and app does not autodetect cycling. Most of the time you either forget to start or stop cycling and most of the data is lost. Also it starts counting pedaling as steps even though you start cycling activity. Regret the purchase.
"Why cant you view your current heart rate on the Samsung health app from your Samsung watch during a workout!?! Isnt that the whole point of the ""health app"" and watch to be active and exercise?? There no way to see what heart zone your in during exercises? I can't recommend buying a Samsung watch when a polar chest strap provides hr info for a fraction of the price!"
I loved the app. Edited: they announced this change at least three weeks ago. I can't find a suitable replacement yet: they had a market and could have chosen to charge a little for it since cash is king. The response from Samsung is ridiculous.
"I was really impressed with this app, but for some reason it has stopped displaying a map of my run. It used to display a really useful colour coded map of my run, but this function appears to have been removed. Any chance of an explanation of why?"
What a shame. I got rid of another watch because the app had a huge banner ad. Bought a Galaxy Active thinking Samsung wouldn't do ads. Guess what? Huge ad displayed on top of app trying to push products down my throat. Looks like I'll be sending the watch back and looking for another. Gave it one star but it should be negative 5.
I have to say Samsung health responds immediately to a problem with its app. Yesterday a gentleman spent quite a bit of time on the phone with me trying to get this app working right. I thank him. It is working better but still needs some tweaks. I recommend this app. Almost 40 lbs have come off since I started walking. This is first time I have ever gotten a response from a review. Thank you.
"Update: Everyone, report this app to Google Play. The app permissions act like scammers hacked it. The madatory requirement for full permissions to my phone is unacceptable. Really?? You need access to my camera and everything else to find the unique identifier to improve MY experience??! All i am experiencing now is gaslighting! Think again Samsung. I am already puchasing a non Samsung device. The data you obviously want so bad you are resorting to brute force tactics to aquire are gone."
I truly loved this app up until they attempted to violate my privacy. Such a shame....I will miss this amazing app. Any app that wants access to my contacts as well as want permission to call my phone is garbage. I recommend you go back to the ways that made you successful.
"I like the features of the app, but it is constantly freezing my phone and updating. It also freezes and don't count the steps. To be honest I am about to uninstall it."
"I really love this app my s9+ to track my heart rate and my sp02 oxygen levels. Since I got my new phone the s note 20 ultra plus, I can't track my sp02 on it. Because Samsung took it off for some reason....I used that daily.. I never dreamed that I would have this problem.. These levels are very important to me. I wish you would put it back on the app. Thank uou.. Cynthia gast"
I love the sleep part and the heart beat but ever since the update it keeps thinking I'm riding a bike while driving 60 miles an hour down the road then decides it just ends half way threw. Don't understand how that happens but seems like since the update things are a lot less accurate than they were before.
Nightmare This is a complete and total nightmare I have tried repeatedly to get past the 2 step authentication (including uninstalling) but it absolutely won't let me verify. It's a HUGE waste of time
"Used it a lot and liked it until the last update. Now it require access to things on my phone that are in no way health related. Completely unacceptable and a big step down. App is now uninstalled, I will put my S3 watch out for sale and start looking for other ways to track my workouts. And spare me for assuring that your intentions are good..."
I do not care for the recent update. The way this app used to manage calorie intake was better before. and for the life of me why can we not use a barcode scanner to put food into the app. It would allow me to completely no longer use MyFitnessPal
"Hello. I have been using the app since April 2020, but I don't know how to find the overall distance of cycling or hiking, only I could know the overall weekly or monthly distance. I wanna know the total distance recorded, cycling for example, from the first time I started using the app. Thx"
"Latest update removed the calorie/weight management feature, which was the most important and differentiating part of the app for me. I will now be looking for other apps and smartwatch options outside of Samsung."
Nice Application.. I hope added Arabic language when that Mobil work in English
"Love this app, paired with my Samsung smart watch. Would like to see my run/walk mapped out better and an overview of the course. At the moment it doesn't show the GPS location."
They've brought back monthly weight tracking with some additional features (even yearly tracking is available now). Glad that the developers took complaints into consideration in that regard! Increased my rating.
I would have given the application 5 stars if I was able to connect my Fitbit Inspire to it. Unfortunately I couldn't. Is there a solution for this before uninstalling and looking for an alternative application that allows Fitbit to link.
"Deleted my review instead of editing it oopsies. üò≥ Previously had problem with steps disappearing for 10 days, but after fiddling round here and there got solved. Super impressed with the quick response the team give. Great app. Bless x"
Great app to use. Plenty info to get stuck into and it links with various devices. 4 stars given rather than because they often bring changes and improvements and so if 5 that would mean perfect and no room for improvement. So it's 5 stars in effect Asa.
"Could do with a few extras added on eg easier food tracker (barcode scanner and what not), female health section etc to avoid having to use my fitness pal as well because I can't seem to get the two to link together even tho that was one of the main features of the galaxy watch?"
"I don't know whether this app calculates my distance incorrectly or whether it's the treadmill. Right now I ran for 25 minutes, the treadmill reads 2.5 kilometers and this app reads 0,35 meters. It's been doing this since I bought this phone in February. The app on the other reads the same distance as the treadmill."
I switch from the s8 to the s10 plus and the step counter is horrible. I compared the step counter to LG phone I have and the Samsung's step counter is always off. This issue needs to be fixed because who needs inaccurate data when working out.
"Update: I've lost count of how many times I've uninstalled and reinstalled the app, which no longer picks up my activity as it used to, and no longer gives me any reminders. Sorry but I'm not calling the US about this as I'm in the UK."
"Like it very much. Motivated by the monthly challenges. Interface can be a little confusing. Like trying to cheer someone, still haven't figured that one out"
"most recent update is slow, and more food weight entry options would be nice (many foods only have servings or calories, many have grams. ounces/fl-oz or cups would be great too, where applicable. otherwise it's nice to have everything in one place: steps, HR, food, sleep, water, caffeine, etc."
App will not load. I have uninstalled and reinstalled. It counts my steps and that is all. I have reported the problem with no luck. I didn't have any issues until I got the S21. Any help is welcome. Update. No help from contacting Samsung. Still doesn't work.
"App used to be useful, so much in fact I purchased the galaxy watch. They have however removed the calorie balance feature and it seems very unstable syncing with other apps. I am thinking I'll probably buy a garmin watch next"
"Locking features out of the watch through this app that are only available if you buy a Samsung branded Android phone is absolutely absurd. At the end of the day, All Android very similar hardware, exact same operating system stop being greedy contacting you for help does not make you give me the EKG feature from my Samsung watch on a non Samsung Android phone now does it? Locking out features of my watch simply because I don't want a Samsung phone. Should be criminal."
"This app is now GARBAGE. It updated itself, and I couldn't use the app at all w/o setting up 2F authentication - no customer notice, no recourse to set it up later. Supposedly to protect my data. 2FA is horribly buggy so it would not recognise the Sms code, I had to go around in circles for 2 HOURS on my phone and computer! Whoever is heading this apps development, FIRE them now. I will never buy Samsung ever again. You ruined one of the few Samsung apps I was actually using everyday."
"One of the main things I use this for is syncing sports activities recorded on my galaxy watch to strava. This doesn't seems to work well at all. There appears to be no control over what activities are synced or when things sync or how to determine why some activities sync and others dont e.g why don't stationary cycling activities sync ? Why isn't there a log to show why activities aren't syncing, why isn't there a button on each activity to force it to sync when it hasn't."
"Samsung steal your data and don't give you any way to opt out. Due to the extremely poor and gender-biased options in their activity list and no way to manually add anything different, I used horse riding - an activity I haven't done since I was 12 - to approximate another activity. Lo and behold - despite having all customisation options turned off in my Samsung account, I'm being hit with horse riding ads on facebook! If you're going to sell my info, at least be honest about it."
"I liked using this app before I did the update. Didnt have an account just stayed all private. Now with the update its asking to manage phone calls? I see everyone's commenting the same thing and the response you give is the same. This seems a little sketchy. I dont want the together with me experience I just want my stuff privately without a worry of someone traking or managing my phone calls and stuff. I will be more than happy to fix the stars once that is fixed, as I did like using this app."
The app is easy to use and performs as expected except for one giant flaw: it does not count steps when the phone is locked. That makes it nearly useless.
Edit: dev responded to my message and helped me out. Changed to 5 stars app works again. I loved it. But now it keeps saying can't open on rooted phone for some reason. The phone isn't rooted and no idea how to fix it. Had to Uninstall it to fix the problem.
"Why do you now need my phone permission???? No way am I giving permission to a health app for my mobile number. There's no reason why I should have to! Edit: To your reply samsung, haven't you learnt about data breach issues of late?! Look at optus and their issues at the moment! This is why you don't need all the permissions you demand. ALL permissions regarding personal information should be optional. End of story."
"I loved this app, however last time I went to check my steps they had updated terms. They want permission to make phone calls on my phone. When I denied it. They just kept coming back to it. Needless to say, this app is now history on my phone. It is being uninstalled asap."
The app has stopped syncing with my Galaxy watch. I'm uninstalling and reinstalling to see if it sorts itself out. I've changed nothing but there has been an update on the watch.....
I am not happy with the new update. For so many reasons. The app took away several snack meal times. I like to eat 6 times A-day small portions of course. It's hard to do that without my snack meal.
"While this app gives reasonably useful information, it drained my battery big time. It always used at least twice as much battery as the number two battery draining app. I had to delete it and my battery now lasts much longer."
"I'm disappointed that it seems impossible to have more than one activity option. What happened to the various activity choices - running, stretching, cycling, dancing and so on? Bring them back!"
"Update removed main features - weight management has disappeared, and it no longer seems to connect with 3rd party apps. I.e I can't see data from my withings and fossil smart watches in Samsung health. Why??"
"I agree that the newest revision is a step backwards. Less compact more, keystrokes to do the same things. Seems to be change for the sake of change and not improvement."
This app used to be great but after it updated it wants permission to access all my files and contacts. It will not allow me to use it if I don't grant all acces. I should still be able to use this app and decide what permissions to allow. I will no longer be using this app.
My sleep shows that I am sleeping while just relaxing watching t v and adds it to my nighty sleep records. I no longer have a way to delete just the incorrect one. I no longer am getting an accurate sleep record. Very disappointing in the last few updates.
"I cannot get pass the 2 steps verification set up because the code never comes!! Uninstalled and reinstalled it, still the verification code never comes, and without setting up the 2 steps, the app cannot be used at all Bring back the old version back please!"
"Why the hell does this app require phone access. And why does it need 2fa. Its a freaking health tracker ffs You people really SHOULD listen. We DONT care that you assure us that the app permissions that you grant when installing the app are used only for implementing the app features and for providing the user optimal experience. YOU DO NOT REQUIRE OR NEED THESE PERMISSIONS None of the information is used for any other purpose nor is it shared with any other parties. Again WE DONT CARE, YOU DO NOT REQUIRE OR NEED THESE PERMISSIONS SO this is uninstalled never to darken my screen again. Thank for stuffing up the app."
"My samsung health app is linked with my Galaxy fit 2 band. It used to show deep, light, and REM sleep but after the latest update it no longer shows this breakdown, it only shows time and length of sleep. Disappointing"
"Version 6.9.0.055 Latest update broke the most useful parts of sleep tracking. Has worked fine with Gear2 Neo until this upgrade. Now the correct number of minutes transfers but the categories are incorrect. A normal night's sleep shows up as 95% restless, 5% light and 0% deep."
"I'm disappointed with the autofill option for meals. it's autofilling, AND syncing with MyFitnessPal, putting me way over my calories. no way to turn it off it seems."
"I've been using Samsung Health since it was created, I never wrote a review on it cause I liked it and I was hoping they (Samsung team) would make it a better experience. over the years they did but still nothing major. example a food scanner... all the other apps I've tried they have one ."
"Requiring phone permission without tell why it needs it. ADDED: I hope the devs made a bot that replies to these reviews, because it must be annoying to copy and paste the same thing over and over. Samsung could use a different method of getting unique id from the device without using imei and requiring phone permission but are either too lazy or incompetent to do so."
"After the latest update, neither my parter or I can use the app. Trying to log in ends in an eternal spinning circle. Clearing cache/app data or reinstalling does not help. We have tested on three different devices (Huawei P20 Pro, Huawei P30, and Pixel 5). A lot of people are being asked to call customer support for assistance, but that doesnt seem to help much. To quote a post from Samsungs user forum, from a user that DID call: ""After speaking to Samsung Customer Service this morning, (and being on hold for over forty minutes due to the influx of complaints they were getting,) I have found out that the new update has begun to weed out phones that are NOT Samsung without telling any of their customers. What makes this worse is that they waited until after Christmas and New Years when people were purchasing their watches and other Samsung items to make the switch. They also are not making any sort of announcements unless you call Customer Service, the representatives only have the information that ""phones unable to log in, are now incompatible with the app"" and have no idea if a new update will change that. I truly have not been more disappointed in a company's' lack of respect for its customers...."""
Had to uninstall the application as i was constantly prompted with a message that it cannot work on a rooted device. My device is not rooted. This issue only started after the most recent update. Please fix.
"I liked this app until it asked me for access permission to my contacts. I did not give it permission ant it does not run any more. Hence, sadly useless. I have a hard time to comprehend this - I used to be a developer many, many years ago but we would not dream about such an invasion of privacy. Response to answer: why not to disable the together feature for those not giving access to contacts and let the rest of the app run?"
"As a runner it would be useful to have some way of logging the distance your running shoes has done. I believe there are some running apps that allow this. But I don't want extra apps. Other than that, I love this app"
Over the last couple of weeks this app has not been syncing with other apps that it was previously syncing with. I am logged into Samsung on the app and have given it permission to sync with the apps.
I didn't really start using SH until I linked my Galaxy Watch. It keeps all my activities in one place and I can also an easily see and review my past days/weeks/months. So far I have no issues and I've been using it for 3 almost 4 months.
"Went from 5 stars to 2. They did away with the community portion, which in my opinion was the best part of the app. I've been using a Fitbit along with SHealth, now will be switching fully to Fitbit because of this change. In the future if they bring it back then I will be back too."
The issue is the same as all the other complaints. I will not grant permissions to allow access to all of my contacts etc.. you need to revert these changes. I have uninstalled and will not use until changes are made.
step counter does not work . Thank you for responding. I resolved it quickly ive had this app over 6 months think it's good i use it daily. could so with a bar code scan as often i struggle with the calorie data.
It was good until new update. Now it is asking for phone permission I have reviewed feedback in comments from Samsung and they don't explain why this is needed. I am a loyal Samsung fan but I will be Uninstaller this app and using another perhaps from competitors. It's upto Samsung to decide whether they want customers or not. A health should not require those permissions. If you want me to say okay start paying per permission.
"Have been using it for years, now suddenly since i updated it, it wont let me see my stats or distances, & it wants me to log in & force me to have a samsung account, i dont like being forced, i try to create one using my google acct, & it wants my call logs, sms data ?? Whats all that got to do with my fitness??? Uh uh no way. Uninstalling/disabling."
"Great app, works well. Just wish there were more challenges we could do beside the monthly global challenge and the 1:1 challenges. It would be nice to have a variety of challenges we can choose from with different goals."
"Dropped to 2 star, after update it says it's does not work on rooted device. I did a factory reset yesterday as my phone kept freezing now it's saying it does not work on rooted phone. I haven't rooted my phone.Yesterday it was working just fine and now after update it's just like went dead üò≠"
Grade app just had a small problem with the meditation and white noise happening periodically and only for 1 second or 2 which is why originally gave it 4 stars. Figured out it only happens when the garden rain scene is selected.
Love the app have used it for years. But I had to uninstall yesterday. Since the Android update it was draining my battery and it had not properly synced since March 2020. Disappointed.
This morning I used the app I enjoyed using most every day for quite a while. This afternoon it required to manage my phone calls and contacts to access the app. Totally wrong guys! I deleted the app instead and good riddance. Sad end to a long term relationship. Now I need to go find a new app.
It's disgusting that Samsung has to put large ads in the app on our expensive devices. UPDATE: There are absolutely ads in the Samsung Health app trying to sell me Samsung products and services. Samsung lies and gaslights us by taking the official position that there are not ads in the app. Sleazy. Skeezy. Scummy. Slimy. SAMSUNG.
"Inaccurate Calorie tracking... It tracks your calories throughout the day which I assume to be pretty accurate but then at random points in the evening your ""calories burned"" drops by 100-500 calories for no reason. Can't look at the calories burned at the end of the day for an accurate comparison to calories consumed."
"I use this app everyday. However, when I run my miles and steps from my galaxy fit do not all transfer into this app's data.... its off over 1.5 miles and approx 2000 steps every 5k I run, this does not happen when I walk. Also, after IF for a 24 hour period, before I eat anything the app tells me that I over consumed between 300 and 500 calories... I eat 12000 calories a day (Im paleo), Exercise at least 8 miles a day, and it still reads ive consumed 100 cal too much.. something is off"
I still like the app but I recently updated my phone and my new phone doesn't connect with my scale. When searching for accessories it only looks for BT\BLE. It doesn't look for ANT+. I have Samsung 21 Ultra+.
Just started having got a Samsung fitness tracker. There appears to be no way to connect to any service but Strava. But i use runkeeper and so do many other people. Why not open up more connections here? Or is there a workaround?
Excellent app except the status bar notification seems to have issues. It displays a long blank notification in status bar that cannot be removed unless I force stop the app. Please fix the issue.
"Samsung lie below. Health app by Samsung has a advert that takes you to Samsung Web page to buy Samsung items and scrolling up on health app it appears, scrolling down it disappears, that still doesn't stop health app from sometimes not working as with gear watch so much so that today will be 3 times in aa month or two I had to rei stall health app and gear watch. Still at least my hiwawi phone and its health app are still recording. Hiwawi app shows 6.3 miles and Sam watchband app 4miles."
"Easy to use. The only thing it's missing is the ability to scan food bar codes when you're tracking your food. Because of this, I'll continue to use the My Fitness Pal app to track my food and macros."
"App is convenient and easy to use and provides some helpful info graphics about your behavior. The new update requiring me to give Samsung permission to manage my phone calls is appalling and unacceptable, Samsung does not need that üòë"
"Great app until weight management feature was removed on latest update. Also time recording for exercise is way off. I use the step counter which is fine but the time taken isnt working. It was fine before the update, please fix"
"Update Mar. 10 - the newest update has completely wrecked this app. Now nothing works right! Contacted customer service and got nowhere. Will try to find another app compatible with the gearpro 2. Getting worse! On Oct.29 the ""together"" features just quit now I continuously get the error 'service unavailable, try again later' I'm wondering will they ever be available again?"
"I had to update my phone, and all of a sudden I had to create a Samsung account to re-access this app, and I lost all my info I had stored with this app before. It also told me I signed into it from a new device!? It's been the same phone for the last two years, only now all my info is gone, and I have this new Samsung health I don't even like at all. What a mess, all my info gone, and replaced by a less user friendly version I never asked for"
Really like this app. Versions have work well with all versions of Samsung I've had this far(S5 to S8). simple to use and history and measurements are on an easy to read format. Love it.
"I will no longer be using this app due to the recent update and the so called ""required permissions"". The app did not require access to my phone previously, and there is no logical reason why it would now. Nor does the canned response to similar complaints in reviews provide any piece of mind. Does Samsung realize how moronic this appears? Uninstalled. Also, they do not pay attention users provided feedback. Evident based on the canned response previously mentioned that follows below. üëéüèª"
"The app drains battery on Android 12+ The reason for this is because the app always runs on the foreground and doesn't let the device go into doze or deep sleep mode. Please check optimization for this, as other similar health tracking apps don't have this issue"
"Lost my love for this app. It was great. It synced with my Ihealth app and life was great. Now I guess they want me to buy another watch. Why must we update??? If I could give zero stars I would. So I called. I spoke with a really nice representative, who did not know Samsung Health NO LONGER works with 3 party apps. AAUGH this sucks."
It works well with Samsung watch app. I like that phone tracks steps even if not wearing the Galaxy watch. Wish it could integrate with Contour Next One app or other glucose meter apps. Maybe Android needs to publish a standard API for this or it already exists? Hope this app keeps innovating.
"Just lost all it's stars. Was a great app, despite its regular glitches. Now I can't do the challenges unless I add contacts. I'm the only person I know that uses it so what good would that do? Unless I have to start harassing people to participate like some pyramid scheme."
"Using this app for many years, but last update blocked half of the functionality, just because I don't want to upload my contacts, and I suspect the app already made it without my permission, it's really suspicious behavior."
"The distance tracking doesn't work with the screen locked. The timer works fine, but without proper distance measurement, it kind of has no purpose."
"I used to love this app! The new update is causing immense frustration, I'm at the verge of uninstalling. Not surprised to see the majority of reviews reflecting the same. I hope there'll be changes (the previous version was great) soon."
"I just bought a new phone. It is a samsung A71, sadly this up doesn't work for some reason. Whenever i open it it says server error occurred,try again later.(0x09). I tried reinstalling and clearing the cache but nothing seems to work. Any help ?"
"Samsung has remotely disabled the ECG/EKG blood pressure reader from the device&you have to hack it to turn it on. They falsely advertised these features when selling it. I want my money back. Why can't I scan barcodes for food? Why dont the food I manually add crowdsourc with fatsecret's main database (not cool using their database and contributing nothing back, Samsung). There should be a screen to compare calorie intake with estimated calories burned. How do I export my data elsewhere?"
"For past 2 days, having trouble with the sleep function. It is not recording the time - both automatic or manual. Other than that, app has been good."
"This is a great app for weight management! I lost about 6 pounds (my goal was losing 7) in 13 days a just watching my calories and doing ab workouts, which is crazy. In quarantine I found myself gaining weight and I'm so happy I decided to be productive and do something about it."
"This app works amazingly well in my phone Samsung S8 . Although its inbuilt, measures everything, I dont need a smartwatch to keep track of my health records. It has Exercise records Sleep records Food Calorie counts Weight Heart rate Stress count Water count Blood glucose Blood pressure Oxymeter Free exercise schedules Free calming music And even additions for women What else do you need in an app? I recommend this app for fitness!"
"**UPDATE**still no O2 reader in Canada!! Why not?? * When I bought my Samsung S9+ I paid over CAD $1000, the phone then read my O2 levels. You have now removed this option for Canadians and I don't understand how you can do that? You removed something from my phone which I paid for in my initial purchase! Also I clearly had ALL my automatic apps update turned off - including the Samsung Health app- so how did you manage to update my Samsung health app and remove the Spo2 option?"
"This app was great until you killed off the weight management feature. Enter food, count steps and activity, measure sleep, heart rate, BUT WHY KILL OFF WHAT LET'S US KNOW HOW IT ALL TIES TOGETHER? Stop messing with things. People want apps that are consistently feature rich. Put back the weight management, put back the oxygen sensor. Leave them there.... Forever. Less information is NEVER better when it comes to health tracking and weight management is the foundation of good health."
"Ads. Samsung put Ads on top of all their apps for S21 launch. S health tracks sleep with the watch and the Ads are white half of the time, defeating the night mode! I've paid for your phone and watch, now what more do you want? Edit. (response to the samsung reply) You are ignorant or lying. Check any Samsung forum and everyone is complaining about the Ads. I have screenshots and the sad part is there is no way to turn them off."
This is just stopped counting all the steps. It might count 5% of what I've done in a day. The last synced is showing hours ago. I've checked the app doesn't need an update
"I used to love how it automatically recorded my steps without having to press a GO button!! But for the last week I didn't realize that it had been literally been putting a 0 for every single day, bc I didn't press GO... I've NEVER had to manually record my steps with this app. Now I do. WHY?? I work at a job where I am constantly on my feet for 10 hours a-day and that's how I get my steps in and I always relied on your app. But I looked at the last week and you didn't record a thing. smh"
The new version is a disaster. Better graphics but worse content. I used to be able to track my weight by day week or month. Now it's by day only. Bring back the old version.
"I bought this watch ,active 2, to use with my Google pixel phone until I went back to a Samsung phone. But now that the ecg monitor won't work on my pixel 2xl and only on a samsung phone I also will not be purchasing a new Samsung phone and will be getting rid of the watch. I'll never buy another samsung product since they deceived the functionality would be compatible with all android phones."
"Crossed the line Was once a great app now to use it requires access to contacts, phone and personal information. I am locked out unless I agree. I guess they are not really interested in Healthcare support. BYE.. BYE.."
"Only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because you can't manually enter your steps like other apps. I don't always have my phone on me, and I keep a pedometer on me for accurate step count. Even if I get 10,000 steps, my app may only say 300. Very discouraging."
"Used to be very good we could do or check lot of things from the phones. Now is terrible you can't really do or check most of the things from the phone, because they want us to buy addition device pay more money, which isn't fair for those who already paid lot of money for the expensive Samsung phones.."
"With FitBit I could view my weekly, monthly and year steps and miles. Why can I only few average steps and no total steps or total miles? I have to go in and add up my steps day by day and figure out a monthly mile for goals. Please make this a feature again, from searching I see the app use to do that, bring it back!"
"The only recommendation I have is that we should be able to set a target ""max"" calory as well as the min. People around me usually deal with the problem of over eating instead of under, so only setting a ""min"" target doesn't really do a thing for me. ""Min"" on the vitamins and fibre etc is useful though. It would be great if Vitamin D is added to the tracker."
"The new features that require 2FA and new, extended, permissions are outrageous and there is not way to opt out. I am not interested in giving you my phone number, nor the permissions to manage my calls to support this ""together"" feature that I am not interested in to begin with. What am I supposed to do now with my Samsung accessories? Carry a Samsung Watch *and* a fit bit because you got greedy in collecting personal, unnecessary data? For shame!"
"Requiring phone permission to even open the app, when that permission is for a feature I don't use or want at all anyway, is a non-starter. At least let me use the rest of the features that have no need for that."
"I just downloaded this app, and it says access is denied because of unauthorized changes made to my phone. What? I have not done anything crazy to my phone. The only option it gives me is to call Samsung and I am not going to call anyone. There should be a way to email or something. I used to have this app on this phone, so I don't know what the deal is. Very frustrating and will be uninstalling the app since it will not let me use it."
In relation to swimming it would be helpful if you could set your own pool length. We have much smaller pools in Ireland. My local gym has just a 17m pool so the info recorded is effectively useless. I dont know if the calories burned are in relation to my heart rate etc or if they are based on supposed distance travelled. It reads 25 yard lengths as the shortest possible option.
"After update, I observed you people have removed the ""weight management"" tracker. Now I can not see the data that I entered for few months. That seems pathetic. You removed it without prior notice. That's hurting all my efforts and even attachment with this app. You must take the users feed back before bringing any change."
"If I could give zero stars I would. I downloaded this app. Now WHY do I have to give a health app, PERMISSION to make PHONE CALLS !!!???? Theres No provision to skip entering your phone number,so ""Uninstall""..oh wait..you CANT,you can only disable it! Thanks Samsungüëç Then you replied ""that its only used as a unique identifier and not used for actual phone calls"".Yet right on the app it says ""Samsung uses your phone number to help friends find you and invite you to challenges""..."
"I've been using this app for years, but after the latest Android update , my app stopped working correctly, I ended up uninstalling then reinstalling the app , but when I did I lost all data from now back to December 5th. So disappointed."
"After downloading Samsung data so I can get heart rate and stress level, I found out I have to have a watch or a band in order to use it. I loved this app on my old phone, but hate this app on my new phone. I need to find another app like my old one where I used the camera and not a band or watch."
I loved this app- used it multiple times every day. Helped me lose 25lbs! Then you removed the 'weight management' part of it. Now it is completely useless. Guess I will be finding a new app. Very disappointing.
"the app has no easy way to create a report but there are complicated work arounds, this is a big miss. Otherwise the app can be very useful to someone who needs to track certain health values."
It is fun to use. A good way to keep track of my health too. I use the black samsung galaxy fit. I participate in competitions. It is fun to use like I said and it helps me stay on progress. I like it that I am more conscious of my water intake and breathing and my sleep.
"Does not sync properly for the past two weeks. Please, fix the bug!! And also I had to reinstall the app and previous info just disappeared. Very disappointed üò•"
"What's the point in having an app that you can't sign into? üò° I had this app on my phone but the maps stopped working so I looked on the blogs about what I could do and was advised to uninstall and reinstall the app and now no matter what I try I can't get signed back into it, really not happy."
"Trying to download personal data gives ""You have signed in to this account incorrectly"" error, but I don't sync my data into cloud... Plus, it worked a month ago."
"Great App for checking your steps, health status and much more. I enjoy reading and sharing info on the community page. also Participating in monthly challenges encourages me to progress better each month Update. 25/05/2020 Thankyou again Samsung Health, fir the great App. Made so many new friends around the world over last few months during Lockdown. Great amazing pictures posted from everyone around the world. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE CAN YOU DO SOMETHING ABOUT THE CONSTANT SPAMS SPOLIING TE MOOD"
"I would give a better review but it's always having issues where it doesn't record my steps and I have to delete the cache or force stop the app to try and get it to work, and I shouldn't be having these issues, especially not a few times a week."
"Great app I really like it, but I would like to be able to see my total distances and steps etc under weekly views. At the moment I can see weekly daily averages not the combined totals."
I would like to see an option to manually input the different in house workout routines and track the daily progress and results. There are only options to input other non in house work out routines.
"Absolutely useless now. Cant measure heart rate, stress and other things. It used to help my anxiety when i could keep track but now its not worth downloading. And NO i cant phone you. I have emailed you a few times but you dont want to know because you dont answer them. I see lots of people arn,t happy with this app any more. Notice they told me to ring them last month before i wrote this post!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"As many ppl r complaining, 2 way step is not working and I am not able to use it. Also, need phone and camera access for a health app? Should I move to google or native android based phone? How can such a big company just decides to mess up an app which was part of the reason to use Samsung. Also, did you guys did not test the latest update at all? First step and it is stuck, can't pass thru it. Should fire the QA team for even passing the test"
"This is a great app the only thing I think could be added is customized workouts. Most times if in doing a leg work out I have to do lunges, mountain climber, squats all are separated. They should just be one leg or floor workout."
Super glitchy. You can't edit your sleep record. It doesn't let you manually edit after you accept it. Sometimes i accidenly accept when it thinks I was asleep but I can't modify it afterwards. This needs to be fixed.
Overall a good app but why is there no cardiogram available for Galaxy 5 watch?
"Great app but overshadowed by the ham-fisted, un-removable Samsung advertising banner that is force fed to us at every turn. Makes me want to go buy an iPhone, it is so enraging. We PAID hundreds maybe over a thousand dollars for this phone, the least you can do is make a native Health app advertisement free. Seriously, fix this and its 4 or 5 stars."
Great tracking for steps and sleep. Tracking water is limited to only selecting 8oz at a time. I have a 20oz cup and bottles are 16.9 oz the app does not add up correctly and does not give a customizable option
"Sorry absolutely disappointing apprently now saying something to do with Knox security bla bla bla also mu phone is not rooted as a full factory reset was done. Why should I make a phone call to you Samsung..when this problem has occured with other users...why cant you people jus fix the error by sending out a new patch or instructions via email. Wasnt anything I did, there was a security update and that triggered the problem."
"I use it as part of my keeping fit regime. Happy with the functionality, exercise programs & motivational functionality. The best feature for me at the moment is he monthly 200k step counter / competition."
"Sometimes at daytime I notice from my phone's notification bar that my microphone is in use (S20 FE). Turns out Samsung Health is using my microphone time to time, not even at night when the phone is charging and trying to record snoring."
Thank you for the great app .. I'm updating my review cause the app is great now and the previous problem had solved
have enjoyed it til recently. Now it doesnot count all of my steps at work. When i am outside it seems to work better. This has only been happening in the last week. I am on my feet at work and walk around a lot. Usually my steps are around 6000 but recently it around 3000. Suggestions for how to fix this would be useful.
"Can't log in! So I decided to be more active at home and treated myself to a gearfit2. Great sorted, looks lovely. I'm installing all the apps I need for my Huawei, go to log into SHealth and NOPE! I am just met with a constant spinning green and blue wheel of death. Less than impressed!! Please sort this out!!"
"Am giving this app a three star because I used to like it, but since the new update it barely tracks my steps, I easily get about 10-15k steps a day, this thing now says I have 2000 or after a very long day, it says I have 4000+ steps, this is not motivational, and sometimes in my notification, it would say I have reach my goal of 10k but when I click, it would be 3k or 4k steps recorded, something is wrong. fix it"
Very convenient and useful. Would love to have more food options from other parts of the world (living in the very East). Adding more workouts in the favs would be an advantage
"There is no reasonable explanation that could justify the need of a health app to require to access to my own contacts. Furthermore, I tried to send the two step code several times but I have not receive ane code. Such a shame that the app is basically useless now after the recent update."
"one of the worst ""sync"" I have ever seen in any app, I use Samsung Galaxy Note8 phone and Gear S smartwatch.... it NEVER syncs the steps or data from the smartwatch on its own, always I have to manually do that...."
Love the app overall but it's a pity that the weekly summaries are no longer working properly! It's a great feature when it works but unfortunately it's very inconsistent in creating weekly logs
"For some reason I cannot access this app. Read the recent reviews and found it's not me it's your app. Therefore, I've uninstalled it as never experienced a problem with it before. I cannot even get past the verification process now. Not impressed!!!!!"
"This app used to be great, but so many features that I enjoyed are now gone. And now the app wants access to manage phone calls/contacts?? I don't think so. And please don't respond to my review claiming that the permissions are to ""ensure optimal performance and user experience"" - what a joke."
"Old one was great, this one a is awful. Why in the world make things worse? ... and on top, even more ads! Reply from Samsung: do this do that. But has nothing to do with settings, just load the old version in this store. That one is much better!"
Yea I'm pissed once again it's not doing want its purpose is which is to track steps I've done everything besides call because I don't make phone calls. last post: I'm annoyed with the fact it doesn't always count steps which is the main reason i have this app. went from being a good 5 stars to a 3 down to a 2.
"Used to work great but since update it shows burned calories way too high. It says I burn about 30,000 calories a day and that's not even remotely true. Please fix this. Using in conjunction with Galaxy watch."
"Horrible! Haven't been able to even go into the app. It keeps saying ""Access Denied"" for the passed 2 weeks. I have uninstalled and then installed but nothing. It's annoying"
"The step countet does not work correctly. I have anothet tracker which says i have run10k but this app only gives me 3k. Such a disappointment. You also need to frequently hold your gadget with this tracker to be able to increment steps. This does not show real time tracking as it updates every like 5 min and after running 5 min you will only see about 60 steps increment in steps. Really, how does this tracker works?"
Got a new OS update the other day and the heart/O2 sensor still nonfunctional. I guess Samsung has decided to drop this feature as it's not showing on future phones either. So I guess the next phone will NOT be a Samsung. I said NONfunctional! FYI nonfunctional means NOT resolved!
Still wondering when we will get full watch functionality like blood pressure in US been a couple years now broken promises.
"I cannot run the prog. On my new samsung note 9 it keeps saying unauthorized changes were made to your phone, I tried restarting phone ,I remove the app. And reinstall put nothing work please help cause this is a very important app. For me"
I'm not able to use it. I'm not able to move to next page after update to Samsung health privacy notice. It keeps on loading. I have Uninstalled it and install it again twice but every time I open it and clicks on continue it keeps on loading. What should I have to do now? Should I just Uninstalled it again and never download it or you are gonna tell me how to fix it?
"Dont use it...too much battery drain. Can't uninstall! If I disable it on my Gear s3, it restarts. I turned notifications off and that helped with battery. Note 9 allowed me to not install the app. I disabled it and it's still using battery! It restarts itself."
I LOVED and regularly used this app until the new update. It takes more steps to do things that were easy and intuitive before and is less visually appealing. I'm in the market for a new tracker now.
Latest update removed weight management and caffeine intake which were a significant factor in keeping this app. Hopefully your people will reinstate these as soon as possible. Most of the peripheral information is of no interest to me. I'll be looking for another app if the above can't be fixed!
The best fitness tracking app! Love the charts and suggestions and all those insights. Very rich user experience. Love it since I'm able to get all the information from my Galaxy watch.
Having a wide number of issues with this will not sync to my watch steps are getting wiped clear read different than what's on my watch not continuously monitoring my heart rate will not show sleep data the data is on my watch when I look at my watch but I go to sync in the app and it tells me it may take a while
Really like the workout section. But the sleep stories are not very soothing. The female voice is very high pitched and fast. Could not relax at all.
"I bought a new active 2 watch and now the app tells me I don't have service try again, then it tells me over and over that my session has expired and I have to sign in, but tells me I have to reset my password again, I am beyond frustrated and really could unplug at this point, you spend all this money and the app drains your battery telling you that you have to resign in every 2 mins, when you go to resign in it tells you your password doesn't work, I have had this app since 2018 now I just want it fixed or deleted!"
"Why would you kill the nutrients weekly view!?!?!?!? This is literally the reason why I use this app. BRING IT BACK! Edit: Fixed it... Installed the previous version from an alt play store. It's sad that you guys just go with your gut and don't listen to the community. Edit: Downloaded the latest update just to see, and now they're forcing you to give your phone number to ""secure your account""... Bullcrap, that's just harvesting ur data, now they know EVERYTHING about you, Inside and outside."
"Update: Has Samsung simply abandoned this app? First they took away the weight management feature. Now the weekly updates are gone. Features disappear but nothing new is added. Why use it? WHY DID YOU ELIMINATE THE WEIGHT MANAGEMENT FEATURE?! That's literally why I started to use the app. Yes I can more or less backsolve my daily calorie budget from other features in the app but, for crying out loud, why do software developers constantly remove features from perfectly good apps?"
I love this app have helped me an alot of ways. Only thing I don't like is that the women health part of the app was working correctly and was amazing up until last month. Now the women health part of app is not working correctly which is very irritating because it's given incorrect information
"I used to really love this app, the pace setter and run training options were great. With the pace setter removed and the positive reinforcement gone the app has lost a huge portion of its useless."
Step count is inaccurate. Only counts about half of my steps. Does not count the stairs. Would be nice to be able to add manual entries also. Does not record stress level or heart rate as it did on my previous Samsung device.
Not very accurate and before you could access your steps without creating an account. Now all of a sudden they need all to your personal information just to count your steps. No thanks. Edit: Not talking about the permissions ... You might want to reread what I wrote.
"DEMANDS phone call & other access for a fitness app. They then say its for some new feature that no one (myself included) is interested in. Just grabs your contacts & adds them to your in-app friends list without checking with you (so say people who actually gave permission to access calls) be it friend, family, colleague, employer, ex, mortal enemy, anyone is free game. And watch Samsung will eventually reply with one of two generic replies that you can read 100x below in other review replies."
"I love this app, keeps great track of your health goal progress, works amazingly seamless with the Galaxy Watch Series 4. Love the step counting keeps me accountable for making sure I get my steps in and try to beat my previous numbers everyday sometimes more successful than others but always hit my 6000 steps count. I love this app, now if Adidas can get this to integrate with their run app....Samsung please help Adidas integrate this and the Samsung Galaxy Watch Series 4. Thank you in advance."
Edit: the response I got ignored the fact that I can no longer log in. I reported the bug and steps to reproduce with no response. Original: Why does this app need access to my phone? Doesn't make sense. I can't even get into the app anymore -- said my time expired and now I can't log in. The app is unusable.
"cannot use this app anymore. keep getting ""cannot use this app on rooted phone"" error. finally had to uninstall as the error kept popping up continuously. looks like a lot of users have this issue. hoping Samsung is paying attention."
"I don't feel giving access permission for making phone calls and to my contacts is justified. The features you say you are upgrading and providing, no one wanted in the first place... it is now just becoming bloatware."
"After the latest update, step counters on some watchfaces for my Galaxy Watch 4 now produce a black screen when tapped. This is super frustrating and I've heard from other uses in the Samsung forum that it affects other parts of Samsung Health on the Watches as well. Can this please be fixed asap so I can have full use of my self-created watch faces again?"
"The user interface, the notifications, everything is good about the app. One suggestion would be to include Indian foods and their nutritional info in weight management. A lot of Indian foods are missing. 4 stars only because of this, else it would be 5."
"App runs in background and every 5 min, overlay is dispay saying samsung health app is keep crashing , send feedback. When it happened my phone get froze until i tap on close button. It is getting really annoying."
Multiple times has recorded a short workout as 100000 calories...which is impossible. I called the only number available for customer support and it just said their office was closed and hung up on me. NO OPTION TO LEAVE A VOICEMAIL.
Hate the last update.. The step count is buggy and lags a lot. Auto step count detectection takes a lot of time and often times stops for no obvious reason. Update. Issues Have been solved.
Really liked this app too keep a track of my walking but your last update? No I'm not giving you permission to make or receive calls. Why do you need that? You have access to everything else on my phone which is a stretch. Time to uninstall like i have every other app that has asked.
"App required user phone number to work. Deaf person here, I stopped using the app. Edit: I received a response from Samsung. There's no need to use contact and phone number to provide me with an optimal experience as I had enjoyed the app even with occasional update on user agreement. Not going to endorse your products any further."
05 Oct 20 Samsung health captured the steps walked for the day. On 06 Oct 20 when checking the total for the previous day (05 Oct 20) it read 'No recorded step data'. Why? It had been recording the steps for years? Reply received 'clear cache'; thank you so much. Missing data was restored the next 24 hour period.
"Real shame I'm having to give this 1 star as I used to love this app but hopefully it will make the developers listen, everything worked so well in one app why did you get rid of the weight loss tracking with no warning either on your latest update!! I was following a target and now its gone! I got a galaxy wear fit to use with this app and now its basically useless, if the weight tracking is not fixed I will have to move over to fitbit and buy their wearables which is a shame üò™"
I love this app but in the last week it has gone crazy tracking my walks. A 4.5 walk records 11.5 miles and the walk tracking map is bizarre mapping. What do I do to correct the problem? Could the latest update be the culprit?
"I used to love this app, but the recent updates have made it completely inaccessible on my phone. It will not complete the two-step verification, just stays on the same screen over and over."
"The stress meter on the watch still sucks. Was better on my previous phone. I was looking at the fitness programs, and it seams that you only cater to skinny people, and prominently women with under 5% DMI. How about some programs for men that have a 40 BMI and just needs help moving in the right direction with someone like them"
The app is broken. It records the workout but the moment I stop the workout it goes into a loading loop. It synchs redicilous results to other apps. I did a 2 hour workout and o Strava it showed as 15889 hours.
This APP is great but it is getting to me because I have diabetic. I bought watch S4 to go hand in hand with my pho e that I count on this app to see how many steps I do daily. It is not helping me when I did everything to get it sync but it does not seem to work. Please fix this. Thnx
Doesn't work at all. It was a fight with the app just to make an account and log in. Now it doesn't track anything at all unless I constantly reopen the app or keep it running in the background. DELETED.
"I was really loving this app until the Weight Management section was removed when I just updated it. Very disappointed, it was the main feature of this app. Now it's just like all the other calorie and step counter apps. Please bring it back!"
The time is not accurate its a bit fast
"Hi there, i use this app regularly but now it doesn't fully pick up my walking trips. It says I've only walked a marginal distance when in fact the distance is a half a mile. The map for my route only displays the area around my home."
ETA - dropped my stars as access to my contact list is now mandatory to access global health challenges üò° *ETA Why does SH need permission to manage and make phone calls??? I don't see any reason for a health app to have this access. What a bummer - all my health data stored and I can't access it üò† Good to track workouts and steps. Developer should include foods with calorie breakdown as right now it's to difficult to track food.
"Used this app a couple of years and at first it was great. Every update since has seen one issue or the other. I just uninstalled it because of the 2 step verification, which I believe is totally unnecessary."
I don't like how this app requires access to all your contacts.
Horrible since the update. I can't even use the app anymore it keeps saying Samsung health can't be open on rooted device. I googled it and even download a app to see if my phone is rooted and it's not. I don't know what that even means.
"Download the app on my new phone and while running on my usual 5km trail (as per the records of this same app on my previous phone) , the app recorded 6.65Km.... This throws away all the stats and performance measurement defeating the basic purpose of this app. Disappointed!"
**EDIT** I called the number and Tenille answered and was able to walk me through the steps. I can now say this is 5 star for me. Thanks Tenille for helping out and thank you Samsung Health for assisting me into a healthier life! I love the app but have to switch devices when I mow my lawn because there's no way to stop the step count. The app thinks I am walking and throws all my step and calories burned way out of whack. I would give a 5 star if there was a way to turn off the steps.
"Great app keeps me trying to do more exercises ,love the Oxy sensor. Sleep üí§ sensor from watch to phone .keeps me trying to get higher step goals just Great app to help us to strive for better health is it perfect no just Great keep up the great job for all the 1 ,2 ,3 people try to find a better app at this price, free don't be a lint picker be thankful for a great free app Thank you Samsung"
"Are you kidding me? Just finishing a run and was forced to upgrade this app. There was no pausing or stopping allowed, just update and no prior warning of the pending update before my run. You call this a smart app?!? What BS. I will find another app for recording my runs! Shame on you Samsung!"
"This app is requesting many unrelated permissions. To run this app you have to allow permission for phone book, microphone, camara etc. I am confusing that how my phone book help to improve my health. I put a same review previously and It has been deleted automatically. Don't use, this app. Your privacy is in endanger. Edit after Reply: Please explain me how my phone book help to optimize experince? Additionally I have already install app but I cannot run without giving permission."
"Its Very Awesome App... It Has Greatly Helped Me Keep Track of My Fitness.. . BUT I would like to suggest that in the "" Discover"" part, you might want to include the balanced diet section and help us choose the right nutrition for the day and stay healthy."
"This new Samsung health update is terrible. Has dumbed down a lot of the features, removed the ability to see the weekly/monthly trends of certain parameters like weight and HR. Why were these features removed??? Looking at your HR or weight in isolation on a single day is practically useless for tracking health, reviewing the trend and change over weeks/months is what's useful. Really can't understand why this feature was removed."
"Absolutely loved this until the recent update removing weight management, I dont see the point of removing it as its useless without it, ive seen so many reviews complaining of removing weight management, wake up Samsung health, for the sake of removing this you are losing all your customers, I just don't understand, we don't want 'im sorry contact our team', no! if you want peoples custome, you need to sort it! look for something else because this is useless and can become dangerous to health!"
"Frustrated - definitely overly complicated with the permissions, and the dumb 2-step verification. Didn't even get the use the app - it kept making me repeat the 2-step verification. Not worth the trouble!"
"If you're changing the widget style at least add it as a setting.. The new green bar with half rounded edges that was forced upon us with the update looks like a glitched texture, just awful looking."
It's super frustrating that this is one of the Samsung apps with obtrusive ads in them that you cannot turn off or remove. I don't need to see an ad for Samsung ear buds or the newest Samsung phone in my fitness app.
Do not like this version of this app the old version was much better this one does not let you measure your blood pressure anymore and stress levels and it does not let you enter your BMI or body fat properly or height and it should let you put the weight in stones and kg It says stress levels can be monitored and measured with watches and bands but it also should be able monitor and measure by the phone app because some people don't have have the watches or bands
"Used to love the app until they decided I needed an account for the device I already paid for, don't want an account? Well sorry. Don't waste your time get any other device, at this time there are better options with the functionality this one decided wasn't necessary. Save your bucks, save your time, and save yourself a bad time."
How could you get rid of the weight management option? I was sick and unhealthy and this app helped me to regain my health 2 years ago. I was so happy with it that I actually wrote a manual that explained how and why it worked because I knew some parts were confusing to many people. Now I don't know what to do because there is nothing else that works quite the way it did. I would be happy to pay a premium fee to have it back. Until then I can only give 2 stars.
Yesterday I updated my Samsung mobile which i am always hesitant to do. After update completed The Samsung Health app wouldn't save anything I entered nor track my steps etc. Today I uninstalled the app & reinstalled it & now requires a password... Still won't let me in ...more than frustrating & I have therefore lost the trends & info saved. I liked the app & found it easy to use. What can I do to fix this please?
"Hello Team, i have noticed if we are doing cycling if we stop for a while it only goes to paused state but never stops completely until finish is selected. This should stop after sometime if we do not remember to manually stop it after some time . Kindly advise and fix this."
"App is great for tracking exercise, however the weekly summary has stopped updating. Thank you for fixing the weekly update!!! Scratch that! The weekly summary is not working again!!!!"
"I have asthma and copd would use the blood oxygen sensor to keep track for myself and my Dr when my breathing was getting bad . Very unhappy the only do it in a app in your watch now Not everyone can afford a new watch every time u Change things I have the Samsung 21 ultra and would think it would have it ,nope why do we pay as much as we do only tofind out we need to buy more it's just wrong!"
"Even though it is set to auto detect workouts, it only tracks half of my movement (half the distance , time etc). Defeats the whole purpose of setting goals."
the most part I enjoy the app that's what I don't like is the autoloading of menus as far as the food consumption for calories because sometimes you don't get a chance to run that I should put what I eat in there and then it shows I'm over which I just choose to ignore
Could you please offer color for your widget that shows the daily steps? After the update the widget is now a glaring white (it was green). I keep it on my home page for easy viewing but it's now so visually distracting (I'm epileptic and the brightness is a problem for me) that (sadly) I will need to remove it.
Great app for an all-in-one health tracker. it would be better if I could track my sleep when I'm awake for an hour or so and my sleep is intermittent-- this app only lets you set one start and end sleep progress.
I used this app for years and was happy. You just ruined a perfectly good app. Want access to my contacts and phone calls no thank you. I do not need two step authentication. You could've made all this new stuff optional if you were sincere. I am not using your app anymore. I just downloaded a new app in its place. Goodbye You still did not answer about the two step authentication. That could've been optional. I am so disgusted with this change and decided my next phone will not be a Samsung.
"The app now does not count my steps or active time. It seems after 10k steps, the app counts just 6k... I did all the actions described by supprot team, pause/resume pedometer, clear app cache, stop start the app, but after some time the steps are again not counted as expected. Please review with your dev team and fix the issue."
This app was fabulous until the recent update when the weight management section was deleted. It is a great way to lose weight and keep you motivated. Please add this section back to the app immediately. Don't understand why this section would be removed instead of others.
Targets were changed with the update and I can't change them back for historical data making all the charts wrong. The active min tracking is rolled into a summary chart making this clumsy to track.
"Used to love this app...all the good features gone and now nothing on it works no/step/weight management/foods...just editing to reply to Samsung's response... Why would I report through the app following my final comment here - ""I contacted Samsung for help re step count and they sent generic info that I had already done and asked for error codes that aren't there, gone back 3 times, it's like talking to robots!"" Seems another robot responded!!"
"Love this app, but... why is there no pause on the pedometer. PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, add this feature so you can easily pause step counting while driving!! Adding pause would make this a 5 star app, just saying."
"Didn't count steps and kms right out of the box on my Galaxy phone (cmon Samsung!). Had to fiddle with the app a few times until I gave up. Had to reset often to get it to function, wondering if it's even accurate. Suggestion of activity tracker accessories are discontinued items so why link to it?"
The latest update seems to have broke the connectivity with the partner apps.. Please fix it! I've had to rollback to an older version and lost all my data in the process. :(
Annoying. Until I've changed my phone everything was perfect but now it doesn't work properly. I've just came back from an hour long walk with my dog and it shows that I've do 43 steps. I walk with my dog 3-4 hours a day but I never done more little bit over 2000 steps.
I used to love the app until the newest update wanted permission to access my contacts to send and receive calls and messages. No way there is absolutely NO reason for them to need my contacts. I deleted the app.
I just uninstalled this app due to the requested permissions. What is the full reason these permissions are required? Every review gets the same standard answer that tells us nothing. There's no reason that a health app needs access to my phone calls. I don't know what other requests there were because I wouldn't allow that one. Bye bye Samsung Health...
"I was very happy with app (5+ years) until required to allow permission to manage phone and contacts . . . which I find too invasive and unnecessary. Please make those permissions optional, otherwise I won't be using app any longer."
"Bring back the weight management tab please. I used that aspect of the app the most, where I could see the calories in and calories out in one screen."
"I see I'm not alone, used the app for basic physical activity tracking. Now the invasive required access to all of your data, calls etc etc is really a no no. No app need access to any of it to operate."
Why when I change my phone is all my step data lost? I've done everything on data transfer yet all my previous data is gone! In the years I've had this app I've walked 1000's of miles and would like to have kept the info. Is this my fault or a fault in the design if the app? I'd like to know if I can reinstall the data.
This was a great app for tracking health info but all of a sudden today it stopped working. It is not syncing with my watch or have any of my history. Hope this can be fixed soon.
"I like that it counts steps and keeps track of times when I am active, where it needs to improve is when I am sitting, the app counts that as sleeping, which I am not doing, maybe have app ask if relaxing, reading, watching tv or recuperating from exercising"
"Another app sucked into the Samsung data collection vortex. Why does a fitness app require 2FA???? After our $3500 Samsung TV turned on in menu ads a year after we bought it I thought I better check the health app before I bought a Samsung watch. Luckily I did, and I've gone with another product. After this phone dies I will not be buying another Samsung. At least with Google you get benefit from handing over your information. Nothing can justify why this app needs phone permission and 2FA."
"Literally unuseable without a samsung account after the latest update. I don't have a samsung account, I don't want a samsung account, and I shouldn't need a samsung account to access my own data from my own device on my own phone, and that is literally all I would use it for. Nobody wants a zillion accounts lying around just so a company can feel special."
Downloaded Samsung Health when I purchased Watch Active2 10/4/20 hoping to get the much long awaited ECG and Blood Pressure Monitoring functions. Only to find out that these functions will Not work on a non Samsung Android phone. I will wait 30 more days for a software update that will load these two features on my Android phone before I return the Watch Active2 for a refund. Very disappointed so far!! Hopefully resolved soon or class action suit should follow.
"I use this app all time to track my steps, workouts, heart rate, pretty much everything. I do wish I could set different targets for protien, carbs, and fats in the food section."
"As I can see, you have a lot of critical opinions after the last update. I'm totally dissapointed as well. You deleted some nice features like pace steps counting in steps counter. I would like to have it back. Maybe next time it could be useful for you to hire some customer experience designer to include the customers in the designing new update process, to avoid destroing a well working app? I don't need your number, thanks, just please bring back my ""pace steps"" counting."
"Please enable the GPS for other workouts such as canoeing or kayaking. Also please renenable the ability to edit workouts in the phone, used to be able to do this and now can't. I end up having to use my Garmin watch for these workouts as the GPS is not enabled."
Overall an excellent app for you health track but I found out that there is no option for measuring SpO2 or stress measurement to measure oxygen saturation. This option was previously available but has been removed now. Could you please tell us if there is any other new feature or way to measure that?
This app is a perfect all-in-one package. It tracks your steps very accurately. It helps to manage your weight very well. It keeps track of every calorie you burn throughout the day. It is really helpful. Good job Samsung!
"I used this app frequently. The new update requiring excessive permission is a deal breaker. I uninstalled the app and wont return unless they fix the permission overreach ASAP.. This sucks cause now my active2 watch will no longer function in the manner I wanted when I bought it. Like others, for me it is time to find a new non- samsung solution. And, your canned response to all the people complaining about the same permission overreach is insulting!"
I have loved this app since I got the galaxy watch. The new update so far looks good but I hate that I can no longer delete naps in the sleep section. I quite often have it register that I've had a nap when I'm actually reading or playing a game on pc or tablet. Please bring this feature back. Thank you
"the latest update makes it hard to count every movement I do.. before the update my run for 5 minutes will at leat give me not less than 1000 steps. but now my 30 minutes wil just give me 500 steps.. what the?!!???.. it eats up my time.. I can do this with at least 2 hours of combined walking and exercising on and off.. but now? 4hours? continuos??? still not able to reach 12500.. WORST APP EVER.. I just don't have a choice at the moment, but when I do, will never be back to this app"
"You can add a vitamin but their database doesn't have any of the nutritional information. A lot of the information for foods is wrong or serving sizes don't match. This app is good for tracking sleep, exercise, and giving a broad APPROXIMATION of macros at best."
I have been using the app for about 3 months. Since the last update it has not been calculating all my steps. My fitbit says 608 steps Samsung will say 58 steps. Im very disappointing at the app cause i really depended on it. I just uninstalled the app.
"One of the best apps UNTIL the update. You do not need the permission to make calls and its hogwash to make a better experience and nothing else. It is ways to access phone ID than that. Unistalling, already replaced with another app."
the activity tracker is horribly inconsistent. I went for a 6 mile walk today and it only registered 4.5 miles. it makes getting accurate burned calories very difficult. I do this walk daily and it consists of about 13000 steps but the tracker only tracked 10k this time.
Deleted app after last update because this app does not need access to make calls or change calls. Grow a brain Samsung. Also thinking about throwing away my S9 Plus and buying two tin cans and a string. At least the cans won't want access to everything in my life. Tech companies better change their ways.
Its food tracking option is really bad since the community can't add anything. The stress tracking option refuses to work even when I have a tracker. This app has so much potential though.
"What is the point of this app when it cannot even read the inbuilt sensor of the S9+. everytime I use it, it continually asks me to place my finger on sensor correctly my finger covers the whole sensor, yet it thinks I'm not touching it. Rubbish!!!!"
"I don't understand why the Samsung Health app needs access to make calls or my contacts and camera to operate. I want the choice to use only the features I want. This is not an answer to my question. Why is access needed to make calls, contacts and camera, specifically!"
"When you remove the need to access my phones personal info, I will be able to continue enjoying my Fit2. I was using it to track my irregular sleeping habits so I could get on top of it. I may lose Samsung altogether now. Really bad business move based on the feedback here."
"The stability of the app leaves a lot to be desired. Logging into your samsung account locks the app, so I guess just sign in as a guest or buy a new smartwatch. Not worth the time."
"Great app to manage workouts and activities. Just one thing, if they could give us option select the parameters to hear from Audio options, it's too long now"
Error 0x2A#0 cannot open the app any more. Forcing to stop and clearing cache does not solve the issue. BTW. Why I cannot install it on Samsung tablet? My galaxy watch has limited functionality because I don't have Samsung smartphone-it's a shame! But why I can't even use the Samsung tab to unlock it?
happy with the application untill 2 weeks ago however I have not been able to update the samsung health application it still ask me to update. Whenever I try to update it does download and says cannot install the update. I have tried rebooting it multiple times however it has jot been of any help. Like many others I have also seemed help however no one has rectified the error or responding to my post. I would have rated the app 4 but due to this poor response and no resolution I am rating it a 2
"Got a brand new Samsung phone. App worked fine for the first five minutes. I then got an error message saying the app wont work on a ""rooted"" phone?! I have uninstalled and redownload it several times and always get the same error message."
the calories under weight management section is totally wrong. in one day there are more than 13555 calories burned due to light activity. samsung dev please take a look at this issue. it started happening after i updated the app and galaxy watch active to latest. i should stay in the original version instead of the so called bug fixed latest version.
"Use to love this app until the latest update. Hard to use now, took away a lot of cool features, now almost every night it gets me sleep schedule wrong and doesn't tell me about my sleep. Now this is just a glorified pedometer. Wish they had not made the changes they did."
"This had a bicycle fitness app included before which I use daily. You were able to track your journey and route, how many kilometers you have done and how long you've been riding. It has all disappeared now. I am not happy about this. Please give information how to get this app back. Thanks."
"I'm afraid the developers don't get it. I've been using SHealth for many years as the connector to my Gear S3 watch. The update several months ago was nice with the new graph chart page for each workout. But then the Terms changed, and now I need an acount, 2 factor auth, and a list of permissions that I wouldn't even give my own mother. I just want to monitor my steps and run cadence before I ship to Air Force boot camp. I don't want to track logs, see others, or find friends. You're now Apple"
"I like the gamification but do not understand what the xp's and levels are for and why. It would also be great to be able to challenge others w/ iwatch. Having exercises and music in this app would help, w/ gamification."
Meh. It's an easy way to track steps. Not great for tracking sleep; options way too limiting. Should be a sticker like on those old weight and fortune machines: FOR AMUSEMENT PURPOSES ONLY üòÖ
"Dire, last update but one made battery usage much worse, most recent update means it now kills the battery in less than a day. When charge has gone to 40 percent, and this one app has used 55 percent that is pretty awful. They keep doing this, releasing battery killing updates and then having to correct it. Some kind of testing prior to release might be a nice idea. Have disabled it, will see if they can get the next update right, if not will uninstall."
Pretty disappointed that the new update took away the calorie management widget. The Samsung health app assisted me in losing over 100lbs. I absolutely loved it. Hopefully they'll bring it back and soon!!
"This app requires permissions to my location, contacts, and profile information to function?! No, it simply does not, but because the stupid devs designed it to force the users' consent to all of that, and because I refuse to do so for any app, I have never once been able to use it. So incredibly stupid."
Until recently hadn't used this app (or even a samsung device) since 2015 when I had a galaxy s6. Hated that phone but samsung health is a great app. Other people with pixels seem to have problems logging in but I haven't come across it. So much better than google fit.
"The app can be super if Samsung health resolves these 2 issues urgently. 1. The Samsung Health App does not show Indian foods in the list of intake, Samsung should some how incorporate this as most of the users belong to Asian community, or it should give us an option to change the food database/ download it from somewhere. Manually adding items is time consuming and inaccurate. 2. Excercise List: Limited to a very few excercises, if you say Samsung is a health and fitness app it should incorporate all the gym excercises (eg. Inverted rows, Machine pec fly...etc etc) or at least give an option to add these. Currently there is no option to add/ download these excercises. Request an acknowledgement on the above requests."
Love it. Just think they should have more apps for the galaxy watch 5
"After this update there is no way to check the average blood pressure for the week, month or year. You could see how your progress was over time but now it is on a line chart. Not good if you want yo say what you average was last month to your doctor!"
I really want to love this app but it does not give you the option to scan barcodes and the food database is not big at all like myfitness pal. If there was a scan option and bigger food selection I would absolutely prefer this app over MFP.
"I used to love this app. However, the updates took away the features people actually use. It used to track calories and activity together, now there is no way to. With the amount of feedback about this specific issue, you'd think developers round get the hint."
"One thing I would change on this is how the days are broken up. I work overnights and would love to set up a 12 hour window of steps and calories burnt up, instead of it just being a 24 hour day. Kind of hard to adjust and see what I do during my shift instead of an over all window."
"This last update screwed up the app. First the body composition metrics page wouldn't work then started auto closing the app. Consulted members services and was passed around from watch group to app group to be told i would have to create a new complaint contacting the other group and now nothing on the app will work. Tried clearing cache, uninstalling/ reinstalling. I'm frustrated üò†"
"I've used Samsung health for many years now and have become comfortable and reliant upon it. It would be super helpful if yall could add a ""Note"" section on more things. Such as Sleep and workout."
"This app is great, I enjoy tracking my steps each day etc. For a week or so now my app won't allow me to open it and closes as soon as the title screen comes up. I'm sure it will be fixed in the next update though :)"
"Since the update, the app no longer shows my heart rate on my galaxy watch when I use the Running workout setting. It only shows distance. Also the Kayaking workout only works on my phone, not my galaxy watch at all."
"I like it, have it connected to my watch and it helps me keep my self on track with my goals. You have a big range of workouts on there, but I would love it if you could add Crossfit, it's way easier to just click on ""crossfit"" and than add in comments what I was doing in the exercise. Today I use ""other workouts"" because I really font know what else to do when I have a mixed workout."
This is a great app! It is a big help when it comes to keeping me mindful of what I'm eating and when I need to exercise. My only problem is that the food list doesn't have the kind of milk I drink so my calories are always a little off. Is there a way too add food that isnt in the database I am missing?
Good App but limited access to non Samsung data input.
"Repeat crashing is now fixed. Regular meal data was deleted after prev update. No longer records active minutes and related cals etc, though it is aware of exercise. Bit of a joke app tbh. Ceased using it as it's not adequate - others are better."
"The program works great for me, however, it would be nice to have a pace target setting as I am a runner and would like to be able to work on setting up a target pace, with the appropriate voice assist. Thank you."
So here is the issues with this app. 1. Taking the SPo2 off. the stress test is NEVER right. I can have an elevated heart rate but that's not high stress. I despise ads at the bottom especially when they are about adult sensitive subjects. I have kids and if I lay my phone down I don't want them asking what a bisexual girlfriend is or what does multiple orgasm mean. I know in Korea where Samsung is may not care but I would prefer my child not read about this stuff in a health app!
"I have used several other fitness apps and this one has far fewer foods saved, no place to add recipes for nutritional values, the workout programs glitch often and the calories burn do not match what my eliptical says so one is not correct. I expected more from Samsung"
"Just found every day if we did not walk, it reduces 1000 steps. It happened to my wife also. She walked 7500 steps, the next day it came down 5500. I don't know. I may check another two days. I also doubt that some mayusing this app. Is it really from Samsung? Highly reputed company hold Very worst app. :("
App was very good and helpful in my experience trying to get into better habits. Since the latest phone or app. update I can no longer open app as it says my phone is rooted. I hope they can fix this and I can up my rating.
After the recent updates useful information like active steps is removed. Also I found bugs such as wrong calculations of sleep. Samsung should use the previous UI which was user friendly with accurate data getting recorded.
"Like others I am very skeptical of why samsung wants to have access to my contacts, phone calls and photos. It has nothing to do with my health. And its NOT good to give out my contacts PII. So I have deleted this app from my phone. I will not recommend this app to anyone."
It was a great app. Unfortunately they removed the weight management feature which I used on a daily basis and was the most valuable for me. I hope they bring the function back so I can use the app again.
"Keeps an accurate track of the distance and update you in your progress, very good app. Even at the lost of internet, it still tracks your progress to the end."
"I would have given you 5 stars... but as with all apps that provide update, functionality seems to always fall by the wayside; i.e. loss of ecg feature; searched food does not appear in ""favorite"" list unless ""starred""."
"Was great. Just tried to update. Refused to finish, kept crashing. Had to uninstall and reinstall. Lost all my progress for today. Was a higher rating before buggy updates. Edit: back to normal."
I just bought the galaxy watch 4 and the sleep tracking is trash. The main reason I use a smart watch is sleep tracking and this one thinks I am awake for 2 hours during the night every time I wake up to use the restroom. This needs to be fixed.
I can't sync account across devices. I logged into health on my new phone with my email and none of my history shows up. Update: Seems to be fixed. Wish it synced with Google Fit as well.
It's too much that I can't sign into my account due to having another phone number. Then says I have too many attempts two step verification try again in a few hrs. It makes me want to get rid of the whole app ugh 45 mins trying to get this worked out.. ridiculous
"Doesn't work on A70 after latest June update. If problem solved, I'll adjust my rating but pretty annoyed an update on Samsung phone cause Samsung app to stop working Jan 1,2021 edit: Still latest update doesn't work... 'the service is temporarily unavailable. Try again later (0x0700010)' But trying again later does nothing. It's great to buy a $250-$300 watch only to not be able to use for what it's intended"
I have to literally delete the app and re-install it for it to sync with my watch. Pretty useless really. This needs sorting out and quickly as it used to be fine.
"Update: Samsung has updated the app again and yet didn't remove the steps sticky notification in the notification bar. Samsung: don't reply me with automatic reply and ask me to call you, what do u will tell me in the call just remove this sticky notification for god sake. Since the last update every body arguing about the sticky steps count notification that can't be swiped away, now I had to stop the steps notification at all to get rid of that annoying notification ."
The UI is very easy to understand for a person like my dad. The ads are non-intrusive blended so perfectly at the top that it doesn't stick out and bother anyone much...And dark mode is dope !
"I'm enjoying this app this go around. I tried it a few years ago and it was poor at best, so I uninstalled it. To make it even better, I'd love if the Exercises included Yardwork, Grasscutting, activities like that that are HUGE calorie burners."
"Hitherto good experience, no reasons for dissatisfaction Lately steps in Galaxy watch not synicing perfectly with app For instance 12000 + steps yesterday being recirded as 1200+ or about 1000 steps now being shown as 150. Tried un and reinstalling both app & watch. Steps counted preferred selected as all steps"
"I have always used Samsung health, and have been very happy with it. I got the watch 4 a week ago and it does not have the option to measure my blood oxygen on the watch, even if I set it to measure during sleep. The past 2 days it's not even measuring my sleep. Really disappointed."
"I've had my s8 for 4 years and never needed to give this app access to make and manage phone calls. Why now? I'm seeing the responses to other similar reviews state something about optimal experiences, which is false. It would actually be optimal for the user to not have this permission asked for."
I've had this app for a long time. Recently with the update it became invasive and asked for my phone number. Why do you need to see my calls and contact list . Stick to counting calories and steps . Uninstalling !
"Seriously Samsung??? What is wrong with you? With every update you ruin something great! Why remove the continuous heart rate graphic, no sleep edit, only delete, also women's health can be more accurate, my scale can't be used with your app anymore, and why Watch4 still doesn't have auto detect cycling??? Upgrading from Active2 to Watch 4 feels more like downgrade. Very disappointed. Feels like the company is loosing connection with their customers by not listening what we love and use,shame!"
"Active calories dissappear! In the Samsung health app it shows my recorded workout and says 500 calories burned but at some point during the day it dissappears from the ""Active calories"" even tho it still shows in workouts. Started happening about a week ago. Every day! Please fix (Galaxy watch 4)"
The application is very inaccurate. Doesn't sync properly. I was working out and it showed i was sleeping. Come on update these things. Samsung seriously needs a new team to overhaul their software. Just a bunch of lazy people woking i guess.
I don't know what happened but all of sudden I can't even open the app. It keeps telling me I don't have access. I loved this app. I've even tried uninstalling and reinstalling several times to fix it and it still won't work. Very disappointed.
whatever fixes you did it now isn't tracking my steps correctly. I walked a mile just now and it recorded o only 1080 steps for my whole day. I know it's wrong because I also park farther out at work so I get steps. please fix the updates or something. I've always liked the app and used to work great.
"How tf are you going to update and suddenly require a two step verification and permission to access my phone when for years it was never needed. Used it since 2015 and now its deleted ‚úå Edit: it seems like samsung is just answering people with ""we aren't using your info so its okay for you to give permission for your phone"" but wont answer why suddenly our step or water intake is such sensitive info that it needs two step verification."
"Recent revised app calls for more permissions. Sweet feature like brisk walk just 5 min ago, we used to get a separate notifications. Now we get in time wise graph. But it ain't helpful. Can we roll back the update to previous version?"
The only thing that annoys me is that I can't turn off the step counter. I'm in a wheelchair and I've never taken a step a single day of my life so you can imagine my surprise when I took 11 steps yesterday morning. I was up to 306/5000 by the end of the day. A personal best! Please change this setting. The joke got old by the end of the day and it irritated me that I couldn't turn it off. Otherwise an excellent app for health management (a major part of my daily routine).
This app used to be helpful for tracking pulse and O2 saturation. Now it is totally useless. Basically you are required to take your vitals by some other means and then MANUALLY enter them in. This app has become little more than a notepad.
This app would be so much better if it gave me a lifetime total number of steps I've taken. I know other apps do it and I know it keeps a record I just wish it would some of them up for me. Other than that I have no real complaints. It keeps track of my steps and sinks with my Gear and that's all I really need it to do.
Very good and organise but have a issue and need an option 1.Drain lots of battery need to optimise. 2.If there is an option to download just 1or 2 meditation music to play offline because not eveytime we have internet. Overall really good app.
"I hate the new layout. Weight manager is gone. The food management section won't detail the carbs, proteins and fats you've had during the whole day, now you have to go to each meal individually. They grouped all the snacks together which doesn't make any sense. You guys really messed up with this last update."
Love how I can track my steps and exercise. This app has really helped me with my weight loss journey. Thanks soo much! I recommend you try it if your looking to get fit and track it all! It also will track ur food calories caffeine and water intake your bp and heart rate and such things it's amazing... so check it out.
"No longer functional. The sleep tracking with my Galaxy watch Active 2 no longer works accurately. And we never did get the promised BP monitoring. You require more invasive permissions, but provide service that is unstable and malfunctioning. I'm the last hold-out in my family not using iPhone..."
"App recently stopped working after a year. Won't open, Also needs ability to change HR goals Last updated 1/23/22 now won't get past ""updates to processing health data"" screen. Clearing the cache doesn't help"
"Just uninstalled it. Used to be an awesome app, now it invades our privacy. I do not recommend anyone to use this not even have installed as it gathers more information that it required. I don't need for anyone to know about my runs, I should have a choice as to what features I would like, you should not dictate to as to what you need access to."
"The app does not have as good of a food list as fitbit and neither my Samsung phone or galaxy watch will count flights of stairs. I've had the the galaxy 7, 9, and now 10. None of them have worked."
"Why has the Gear S3 been removed from the step data source? Normally the S3 has been the most reliable source as the using the phone as source picks up everything as steps. Rode 42km on my bike this morning and picked up 22,000 steps. I usually have it set for S3 source and gain a couple of hundred steps (getting a cappucino) on a ride. edit - I do not intend to make an international phone call - you have enough info to reinstate Galaxy watch as a source."
I like it for the most part but it keeps erasing my blood glucose levels. I enter them a few times a day and it tracks for a few days and shows me the trend and then erases all of them.
"What's the point of having his app if it wont sync to the watch to record data? Having to manually enter every.single.thing. Watch and app are ""connected"". But does not sync gathered data."
"Helpful keeping track of sleep, exercise and eating habits. Difficult to be totally accurate but very good in giving a general sense of your habits in these areas."
"App now requires access to phone and contacts to function. Also 2 step verification. Will no longer use. In response to support, this is unacceptable. If you say you won't do anything with my contact data, then why is it required for the app to function? Unacceptable."
Clean app with a friendly UI.. would be good to have batter data widget customizability so that it's easy to break down some views of the data. And some improvements on data download features
"After a recent update I'm September 2021, samsung health and healthy 365 cannot 'talk' again. This is another frustrating episode. Now samsung health require the installation of another app to manage all health information which disallow healthy 365 to connect....."
I've been trying to setup the app for God knows how long every time it comes with an error ( unauthorized changes were made to your phone contact customer service ) I reported the issue sent emails and nth was done. I had it working on another phone absolutely fine idk what's wrong now
"The step count is not being read properly. I joined an event where you need to have 100 000 steps in 1 month so I aim to have 3333 steps a day but this app is making it hard for me to reach 3333 because it counts far less than the amount of steps I have taken. Edit: Thanks, it is now working properly"
"Somehow your pedometer is not working well enough on my Huawei. Don't allow refresh on the pedometer which is kind of useless. When I chose the app, the pedometer doesn't pick up my walk. What's the point of having it when it can't track at all? I'm forced to use your app. >.<"
"I've used this app now for a little over a month . Some of the calarie counting is off. But if your trying to keep track of your macros, it's a start. Not everything is listed. This should be used to learn how to be consistantly. I have lost weight and it works for me."
"this app seems to miss long stretches of walking, in last 3 days it seems to have missed approximately 4000 steps. i am not able to use roaming data bit this shoukd not be a factor in its ability to count steps. i have uninstalled and reinstalled the app to see if the steps would be count but unfortunately it took all my steps off for tiday so have uninstalled and wont bother with this rubbish again"
"Just why??? Why try to fix what isn't broken!? This latest update is HORRIBLE! I was using and loving this app daily, even lost 7lbs, but tool that I was utilizing has been removed! The weight management tool is essential and its absence is detrimental. BRING BACK THE CALORIE TRACKING SYSTEM! üò°"
Doesn't work well with Mi Smartscale. Unbelievably the app is registering 10X the total weight shown on the digital scale. (Update 14Jan2021 - I give 5 stars on resolving the weight reading issue with new software update. Bravo Samsung üëè)
"App looks great but some things are ridiculus. There is footbal as an excercise but it doesn't let you track distance. In general, indoor distances are poorly tracked."
get way to track walking and simple things. only problem is the connection to galaxy watch which tends to do it's own thing and unconnected to app. otherwise easy to use and good motivation to do more.
I recently upgraded my Samsung galaxy to S21 and tried to install this app as on my last mobile it worked really well. However I cannot install the app as it refuses to recognise my account. I will look for an alternative... I have received an email from the Samsung App telling me to reboot and try Samsung Health app again which I did but it has still failed to let me sign in. It doesn't even recognise my number which I have had for a number of years. I will now look for an alternative app.
Where should I begin? I use every feature religiously and love them all. My only suggestion would be to enhance the sleep info and maybe offer the option of body temperature reading. That's IF our watches contain that capability/sensor required.
Hi Developer.. The sync from watch doesn't happen automatically. I have to do it manually and there is no guarantee that it will that time either. Please fix issues or if I need to do something on my end let me know.
"The app is like a decoration on my phone. Everything I used to like about the app is gone. The most frustrating is, I can't get an update of my steps when I go for a run. Why call it an upgrade when you actually downgraded? Pls Fix it"
"Wow Samsung you really managed to f up this app the old format was just fine . The new one is garbage can't measure my hear rate , will be removing immediately . Update managed to get it working , the light from the s20+ was burning my finger as I was measuring my hear rate . Nice touch"
"the new update has completely ruined this app. It now says I'm asleep when I'm reading and i am no longer able to delete just one sleep cycle, I have to delete it for the whole day. I don't understand why you would fix something that didn't need fixes. It's now a useless terrible app."
"I cant open the app since the latest update, despite numerous reinstalls and anything else I can think of, everytime I open the app it crashes out. No other way I can seem to use my Active 2 watch now which I only bought a few months ago. Is there any way to restore to previous version?"
It was easily a 5-star health tracking app until they decided to remove the 'weight maintenance' feature on the Aug/05 update. This feature allowed you to monitor and hit your weight goals easily after inputting your daily consumption and activity. Why they removed the best feature of the app is beyond me!
I reset my phone because it was having issues. My phone did not have this already installed. No biggie. It will not let me download the app just sits on the verify for 45 minutes now. I have the samsung note 9
"The app is very simple to use and shows relevant daily activity info, steps, heart rate and sleep hours. The 'Together' challenges make it very interesting and motivates. Great fitness and well-being app!"
This no longer tracks your exact routes! It only shows a straight line from beginning to end of your walk/run!! What happened to change that? It used to show exact routes.
Not counting all of my steps I've been walking for 4 hours and it only counted 75
"I used to love this app but New update needs permissions and Samsung Healths response is exactly the same for every query regarding this. With everyone complaining, how about you simply remove the phone and contacts permissions, Evan if you say it isnt being used for other information or shared. Definitely shows you dont read these messages and you just simply replied with the same message you gave everyone else.. delete"
"I can't track my heart rate during exercise, having just discovered they removed this feature with thier latest update. The feature was there when I first tried out my watch/phone and then it disappeared. Sorry to have wasted my money...."
"Update...Why the big change!? I had all my own fave workout icons on the front 'page' of the app... Lost now! I have to perform extra wk to get to the exercise. It's an unnecessary, I believe. Whats the cost to get that back in this app? (Please read the entire review a d its update) Update 18 Mar 21 It's a good app. üëç"
I enjoy using this app. I compare steps to two other devices and it proves to be comparatively. I really enjoy the discover features as well. I track my calorie intake by entering food and I'm slowly seeing the pounds come off. My doctor says she's proud of me as am I.
"This app is great, however, it fails to count steps on my huawei device (most huawei models according to google), when the app is closed, but when the app is open, it counts fine. PLEASE fix this. This is a major issue and its a critical user function since this is the preferred app for health insurance etc. Just PLEASE fix this."
"It is the best app for losing weight ,it helps you track your every day different sports. And it is suitable for making diets. It reminds you to drink water daily. This app is the best app in the world. There is many things to like this app. I recommend for everyone to use this app. üòÑüòÜüòâbut it was better before the updateüòîüòìbut it still greatüòô"
"Why can't I enter steps in manually? I've been using this app for quite awhile and love the features, however, my watch no longer syncs with this app. I'd like to continue using it, as I have many step challenges with my family. Please make an option to manually enter steps."
"7 years ago I luckily had a holiday in Hong Kong. I was feeling hungry so popped into a restaurant and was handed a menu by the kindly gentleman. Unfortunately for me, the menu was solely in Cantonese and so I had no idea what to order. That menu was 100 times less confusing than this app."
Why in the world does the app not work without an account like back in the days?? It's literally the best fitness app out there and that makes it unusable now. I don't understand why counting my steps and measuring my pulse has an account and internet access as a REQUIREMENT. Making it optional is great for people who wanna store their data on Samsungs Servers but making it mandatory is the worst downgrade possible. Goodbye
"The decision for Samsung Health not to sync steps from other apps is baffling. I bought Health sync for life and now it's pretty much useless to me. I chose a Samsung phone, and I chose Samsung app for my health app, and now I feel cheated. Not cool. I love Samsung Health and I generally love samsung gsms but it is getting hard to enjoy it with so many exclusives. I'm getting tired of this."
"Good until it required me to give the app permission to use all my files, access to my contacts and make phone calls. Is this a Korean spy agency? My suggestion, delete the app. ""No information is used ..."" so why does this app need my contacts, or to make calls? Please explain that part. Also would the makers of this app allow likewise to another app maker? As of now, this app has been deleted already."
"I upgraded my phone to the Samsung galaxy s20 and now the app won't let me take any measurements.. After speaking with a Samsung Rep, It isn't working because there isn't a heart rate sensor on the Galaxy S20... That is Sad.... Wish they hadn't done away with it. Gentleman I spoke with was very kind and helpful."
This program was a 4 star until they removed the Weight Management function. There is absolutely no reason to have removed something that worked off data input into the system already. Now the app is a glorified step counter with a poor food tracking database.
"Version 6 is, in my opinion, a step backwards because the big tiles waste a lot of space. As a result, I have scroll more to find stuff."
I also deleted this app off my phone when it asked for unnecessary permissions. I don't need an app especially this one to access my phone or contacts. This should be optional and not forced upon you in order to use the app. The use of my phone or contacts is not needed.
"I WAS enjoying using the app right up to the point of needing to update privacy that informed me app needed access to contacts and phone calls. I have since removed this app. I respect the privacy of friends and families info they trust me with. I am not going to ask them all to be able to use their info for an app. I see absolutely no need for this to tell me how far I walked, biked or horse backed etc. Maybe not going to share intentionally but hacking happens. Then there's HIPPA."
"A disappointing experience. Just ordered the S20 and galaxy 2 watch, I will say I am not happy with my purchase. The BP does not work, and the SPO2 is not working even with continuous stress measurement. Its very disappointing, if Amazon can sell a $20 dollar watch that has all this features, a billion dollars company like Samsung should be able to do better. 7 days left for a full refund, I am 70% leaning towards a refund. Samsung, you should be ashamed, Apple here i come. smh"
"After upgrading, unable to link/connect to the apps which I've been using for rewards. üòï Tried reinstalling Samsung Health but still does not link/connect with other apps. All my records in Samsung Health are gone for nothing. üò°"
"I like using this application but lately it won't count the steps that i take correctly even though i was walking the whole day, i thought i must be a fault in my Fitbit fine but even my exercise that i try to keep track are not being registered correctly. It will suddenly stop working mid work out and i will only notice once i finished my workout that nothing was registered. Please see if we can work this out"
This app just keeps getting worse I used to enjoy it so much
"A week ago, I could see how many steps I had as I was walking with my phone, but then after an update, I couldn't see how many steps I've done. It just shows me 'Samsung Health Steps: 0' although I know that I had atleast 1 step with my phone, but it doesn't record any of the steps I've taken. Back then when it did, I was quite happy, but as for now, I don't think this is a recommended app for you to use. It doesn't track your steps, not like it did a while ago."
"step double because (watch+phone) please fix this, app need to count from phone if i'm not wearing watch if wearing watch phone step must be turn off. Add Feature- Facebook Friends finder. Interface need improvement. circle like interface for all activities."
"I am pleased in so many ways with this app. I battle constant aches/ pains, and this platform meets the needs of my ever changing workout routine. I've highly recommended this app use to family, friends, and some safe strangers ;) A huge plus to my already positive SG9 experience."
Seems like I'm not the only one that HATES the new update requiring permissions for things that this app DOESN'T need!! And the generic response to everybody that feels the same way is comical!! Way to screw up a decent app Samsung!! Wasn't the Note 7 debacle enough for us loyal customers!! Don't bother responding with the Bullüí© generic response!! It makes it weird for all of us who take the time to let you know that you screwed up and should go back to how it used to be!! Another Samsung FAIL!
"Used to be good. As of last week, it's asking you to synch with some app called Health Platform in order to connect to other apps. It used to synch with MyFitnessPal on it's own. Now I have to use another app to synch."
Nice app for keeping track of everything. I deducted a star since in all the events you allow cheaters to participate and I saw no measures taken in order to correct this. I appreciate the reply but some people got more then 1000 steps per hour 24 out of 24 dosen't raise a problem? Is it that hard to make a check ( if more then 1500 steps in a hour remove from challenge ) and see if it is physically possible to do so many steps?
I begin exercising every summer. I know the route that I took. I wallked at an easy pace. It is maybe 2 and a 1/2 miles. The app claimed I had gone 3.75 miles and had a top speed of 8 miles per hour. I never so much as jogged.
"The 02 2021 update is TERRIBLE!!! It forces you to create an account and sign in, and the layout is not nearly as easy to read as before. This used to be a handy tool, now not so much. I should have just left it alone and not done the update. ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
"I've had a lot of issues in the last week of using the app. Previously I've had no problems, now it doesn't record any sleep or my steps and won't sync to my Samsung watch 3. üòí"
Love everything about the app except logging food. The database is way out of date and I spend all my time making custom food profiles for what I need to log. Serving sizes are also inaccurate for most of the food options in database.
"Absolute garbage now. How is it that this app no longer even performs the basics if you are a gear s3 user? Taking away the ability to add steps only from the watch? It is the most basic of functions. How can a watch be so good but the app be so terrible? Seriously, what is going on?"
"Latest update deleted ""healthy steps"" count. Why? Also, what pace do you have to maintain to count as running? Average 5mph and still being counted as walking. Doesn't always count step accurately while running. Ran 2 miles. Only recorded 1 mile with the step counter. Need a way to manually record steps."
"I LOVED this app until I upgraded to the Note 20 Ultra. Now I am not able to check my heart rate or blood oxygen levels on my phone, which is a big deal for me.... I have asthma and diabetes and it really helped monitor how well I was breathing. TOTALLY DISAPPOINTED, Samsung... your new, high(er) tech and insanely expensive phones don't monitor these important things anymore. VERY DISAPPOINTED."
"I love this app!!! Fantastic! It supports me to walk more, to do more excersice and improve my results! Thanks to others participants with who I've done a challenge finally I've got achive the January month challenge! Highly recommend!!!"
"This used to be a great app. I can no longer get it to track different activities... Very disappointed. Maybe I just need better instructions. Where do I find that? I got a reply with some suggestions, but a friend showed me how to set things up to get the info I wanted to show. Maybe having better instructions on how to use the app would help others? Thank you..."
It will be great if you enable tracking steps only via weaeable device option. Since most of the time mobile count steps inaccurately. Understand that pause option is also available as well.
"Been using this app for a couple of years and to be honest was fantastic (5 stars) but after last up date on Friday it stopped working , tried uninstalling and installing again worked for a day then stopped , have now changed to different pedometer app (pacer) and this app works brilliantly with Samsung A6 2017 / 18."
"Used to be good but since latest update the info isn't as easy to see, and the app preset too many details, turn it back to the old version, if not I'll be looking for an alternative app."
I use to love Samsung health till I got the new Samsung Galaxy s10+ when I go out to do my daily steps which I do every day the phone is not recording correct at all. it recorded only half of the steps. what a disappointment. I will stop use it and dry to find something else. that is more accurate then Samsung health
"Im a samsung user since the beggining of samsung: i have found a sensibility bug on galaxy s10+ oxymeter, they should fix it by software. On galaxy s8 doing the same the results are the same, but, if in galaxy s10+ i press harder, my spo2 decreases to 70 and even 80, fix it."
Not giving permission to access and make phone calls. Y'all might want to change that. The other 100 + health apps available don't ask for such permissions. I've used Samsung phones for years. But after this I can promise my next device will not be a Samsung.
Oximeter sensor reading was moved within the app buried now in the stress portion. I'm raising my rating up to mid way as I am not sure it is always associated with stress as heart rate would be.. It was great whe re it was.
I like the old version more because it was showing my macros for the day. I like the new design a bit but the previous version was better. If it aint broken dont fix it... Anyways now I have to choose another calorie tracking app...
"Not bad. But this app works better on the Samsung watch in my opinion. The option and the statistics should show from the watch the the Samsung phone. Overall, this app has been helping me with my journey."
"I like the app but doesn't sync to Google fit. Will this be integrated? Update: when I ask about integrating, I mean without downloading another to transfer the information from one to the other. The ""middle man app"" also cost money so I just deleterious it after the trial period expired"
"Last Update is unusable! Thanks for nothing! I mostly use the watch and app for supervising my sleep. Well, that doesn't work anymore! It won't update the times from my watch and since that stupid update it doesn't show me the info on my watch either! IF I get it, by any chances, to update, it miraculously can show me the info on both devices. But WHY do I need to get the info on my phone to read it on my watch? It's wasting my time!"
"On my previous phone/earlier version of app there was no login requirement: I do NOT desire to have my personal data stored anywhere not in my control and therefore SHALL NOT use this app. Delete this requirement and I may review again!!! Love how their email address is an out-only one: ""noreply.sec..."", makes you wonder..."
"Updated Jan. 18, 2021 The latest update has me frustrated, as well. I used trends/averages to keep up with month to month and year to year changes in various categories. I don't need another social media app. I need a health app."
"Love to use this app. It really helps me to manage my daily routines. Monthly challenges are really awesome. It also helps me to manage my sleep cycles , daily calorie intake and burn out, water intake, caffeine intake and weight management. Steps counter is the most useful feature of this app. Highly recommend this app for all Samsung users. Really awesome and indeed impressive.. thanks a lot Developers for building an amazing app. ‚ù§‚ù§üòçüí¢üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüëç"
Does register step while driving. Today I noticed it was counting steps while driving to work so needless to said can't relay on it. After following Samsung instructions on how to fix my issue is working great again. Thank you for your help.
"Uninstalled this app now that it forces you to share access to phone calls and contacts. The standard line from Samsung you see tagged on to the complaints is that it's important for implementing app features, well it hasn't been for many years and why force it now? I'm not particularly interested in the company's official excuse and I, like many others, am not granting this permission and I'm out unless the next update does away with this privacy intrusion. Very disappointing."
I don't like the new food or weight update. The previous version was perfect with 6 meals and I liked the list of weights you could view. I may get used to this one but the previous version seems better
I like the app I think its good but not happy about the change in sleep tracking. I found it useful to see how much deep sleep and REM sleep I got but now it just says motionless...what does that even mean? Not happy about it and really disappointed. I used the sleep tracking so much üò¢
The app is showing incorrect number of steps. The Fit2 band shows 7637 steps and after several times sync the health app shows 7062 steps. Reinstalled galaxy wearable. Nothing changed. Will return.
"The app works really well, only complaint is the tracking for the events. I'm not really sure how aome of these participants are reaching OVER A MILLION steps within the first week?? So it really takes out the fun of participating in the monthly events, i use it mainly to track my own personal goals instead."
"Tracks everything you want to an OK standard. To improve you really did to display info / trends better. Biggest improvement would be barcode scanning for food, everyone else is doing it but Samsung"
"App has been draining my phone battery excessively of late. Anything less than 40% when going to bed, and phone is dead by morning. Terrible. Not sure what's changed. Uninstalling for now."
After working excellent for the past 3 years after the most recent update it does not work anymore. Does not connect to GPS. There was no need to change it as it worked perfectly.
The food journal is good. It has a lot of common things from both grocery stores and restaurants. You can add anything you can't find. I wish I could do the same for a workout- add my own exercise and reps
Filled with ads. Literally the top 1/3 of the screen is one big rotating ad for the phone and watch that I already own Edit to developers response... This app 100% contains obtrusive ads. People are outraged about Samsung's built in app ads that are only being applied to certain regions
"Samsung needs to play nice on the Android ecosphere. This is the second time in 2019 where the health app can't sync with HealthSync or Virgin Pulse. Ridiculous! For those of us who use Gear watches and Samsung phones this is absurd! Figure it out! You know you broke it on 8/30, so fix it!"
It was perfect until they took away weight management option it sucks so much Basically pointless to even have the app now. I lost so many pounds using it to count and share my progress.
"I've used this preinstalled app for 3 years on two different mobiles, the recent updates cause it to work intermittently, it won't synchronise either. I've uninstalled and using a different app."
"App has been working on and off for months. Keeps saying it's ""updating"" then doesn't count any of my steps. Doesn't sync with my Samsung watch properly either."
"The Tracker has been updated, as of today 1/14/2020, to correctly reflect calcium intake. So, I have updated my August 2019 two-star rating to a four-star. (Prior August 2019 rating: Tracker is incorrectly recording calcium intake in mg instead of percent, ie, 40 mg instead of 40 %. Only recently happen with the last update. Otherwise I would have given it a 4 star rating.)"
Was good to start with have only been using it a week when it said i walked 233 steps and i went from one end of the town to the other and back plus walking dogs phone was on me the whole time. If you dont keep it with you in your pocket obviously it wont realise your walking. I have had to uninstall it and reinstall it again hopefully it works properly this time
"It's a good app, but it is missing something. Maybe a drink reminder, some advice on food, notifications reminder, tips etc all would make it more fun and complete."
"The app is OK, but it seems to have lost the daily calorie burn info, which is fairly significant given the whole reason for the wrist based HRM is to give users this type of data. Samsung, can you please correct this, because it's annoying and pretty much renders the HRM useless except for specific activity."
"Samsung becomes Apple! App, OK-ish, but... I am Android fan because of it's open eco-system. But with Samsung now you can't import steps anymore, only their own devices seem to work. Samsung becomes too Apple-ish for my liking probably time to switch ... There is also a bug when getting food in from MyFitnesPal which has a barcode reader to scan your food. Whilst it gets calories OK recalculating to portion size, it does not do it for the Macros. I find myself using Samsung H less abd less."
I love this app!!! The challenges motivate me to walk more and watch my caloric intake. As for the APP itself...never had an issue! Always works great and I am very pleased with the ease of use.
"Add the ""Health Sync"" App to your verified roster... Now that you no longer support Health Sync, why do I need your app? It doesn't track workouts with names, weights and reps, like Google Fit, so why force it on to my device? Using Health Sync allows me to sync my Google Fit Data being that you won't allow it to directly. ü§¶üèø‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Why so closed minded on an open-source platform? ü§∑üèø‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Please change this or let me delete Samsung Health altogether."
"Awesome! Later edit: Since the last update, the oxygen saturation measurement function was removed and this is a bummer, because using the stress measurement isn't an option since it takes a long time. Why did you remove this function? At least give us an explanation."
Update: App works great the 2 step verification process is questionable. My carrier blocks some of their text messages and no option to receive another way. If you finally get to the app you will be pleased.
"The app is fine but they now force you to give permission access to make and receive calls, and it's unclear that participating in the Together challenges may or may not now require you to share your contacts. If this is the kind of junk they're going to start requiring, I'm out."
I don't mind the app overall but think the food tracking can be more robust. I use MyFitnessPal for food tracking. The main reason for the low rating is I hate that Samsung removed the SpO2 tracker! Please bring it back!
"I do like the app, as I walk my dog it actually says it paused the workout if I'm standing still to long waiting for my dog to do his thing and then it starts it's self back up again as I start walking again. It might be a little off by steps...maybe, but its cool."
"step tracker is garbage. I drive a lot and it reads each bump as a step. So I have 1k steps by the time I get to work. I'm no app coder writer but I'm pretty sure the gps could be used to sense that I'm not walking 70mph to eliminate those ""steps"""
"They removed the most valuable and important features of the app, so the $700 worth of Active watches my husband and I just bought are totally useless. Really disappointed. I feel like I got taken by a bait and switch."
"Where did the things like the oxygen sensor etc go. My friend has same version as mine & our interface doesn't look the same. I'm on an S10 Note +, nothing for h/r, 02, or stress shows up in managing items"
Used to record step count and heart rate nicely which was all I wanted. Said it can do heart rate through stress/pulse oximetry but that does not appear as an option. Seems the new improved phone is anything but.....
"The app hasn't been tracking my steps properly. It said I didn't walk at all, and I have been moving non-stop all day. I checked to make sure it wasn't paused because that is how it's acting. This same issue has been happening to other people I know who use this app. Please fix this issue in the app."
"It's a great free preinstalled app that monitors my athletic activity which came in handy just recently, but I feel like I need more details as to what I'm improving. All I know is how much fat, calorie, and etc. intake I'm getting, my activity a day, and how much I weigh thus far yet nothing about muscle mass. I wish in future updates it can come with a way for it to estimate and maybe provide an estimated 3-D image as to how my body is looking both in and out fat wise and muscle wise."
"Great Tool! I use this daily to track my macros, calories, weight, and exercise. My only complaint is it doesn't keep track of sugar intake. I would find that helpful."
The last update made things worst. The sleep tracker no longer works properly for deep sleep. No update in the list of compatible devices for weight measurement (xiomi scales not yet detected).
Loved this app. Now I can't access it without granting it access to most of my phone. Not interested thank you! Luckily there are lots of other apps available that do exactly what this one did...would totally call...if only I lived in the same country as that phone number ü§î.
"Garbage now! Used this app for years and loved it, up until this last update. Whoever thought this was a good idea should be fired! I will not submit to these permissions. But I will stop using this app immediately. Totally disappointed. I intend to seek another health app. Maybe even another brand phone and watch (Apple here I come). Again, TOTALLY outraged at this decision and I hope enough other users feel the same way. USER EXPERIENCE my a#$! Not having much of an experience now!"
"Poor app data visualization, graphics and details compared to other compatriots like Huawei...This is a shortcome that should be dealt with. -------- Hi Samsung, I can't call your international phone number and if you really want to get in touch with me then, let me know to share with you my contact details."
"Please add reminder, especially for water. Edited: Far away in terms of features compared to Apple health app. Try to improve and add features like medication and other imp sections. Besides releasing fixes try to add features."
Got my Samsung active 2. Was excited to use this app for my fitness tracking. But the app doesn't work well as expected. Initially issues were with syncing... No weekly summaries. No use of buying a Samsung watch 2 when no suitable app is available
"Wont let me use the app unless you have permission to call people in my address book, and use their numbers to gain more downloads. I have reported this. Responding: the update literally says it will have permission to make phone calls from my phone, spin it any way you want- I think its very unprofessional, and extremely entitled."
Reasonable but would be better if it was more like the fitbit app and has the ability to be the single source for customisation of my watch as well as the space to see and record fitness and health data
"Samsung had a policy update and now I cant use my app. I dont understand why a health app that I use to track my walks, needs access to my phone to make calls. So I did not allow that option and now the app refuses to work which is a bummer because the kids like to see how far they have walked when we all go together....."
"This app is great. The only thing I wish they add is wherein you can issue a challenge to more than 1 person at a time at a time. Suchas, I would like to create a personal group challenge."
The best all in one health app I have used but please sort out swimming so that it can record lengths less than 20m and integration with Withthings Health (required for good weight monitoring as they display weight better and have there own scales).
"I called the number provided and they won't help me because I'm Canadian. I submitted help claims on the website and the service is so unhelpful, they are just copy and pasting instructions from a manual for me to download a dump log on my samsung phone and it's written for app developers to understand. I need to speak to a live person to help me, this is ridiculous. I was told there are no live people to talk to for anyone living in Canada!! My watch and app are both useless, can I get help?"
"Used to be a great app until the weight management section was removed on the last update. Why? It appeared to be a major part of the health app and helped me personally lose over 10kgs. Seems like a terrible decision by Samsung, many other users also appear to be upset by this judging by a quick Google search."
"Completely disagree about new privacy policy! Some health app has nothing to do with making calls and accessing contacts,but to counting distance and calories and stuff like that!I'm very disappointed i left Apple after 12 years for Samsung...and..this..is like a serious intrusion in my privacy,i can't accept this, too much!"
"Find it highly suspicious that it needs permission to monitor your calls. In response to the reply that gets sent to everyone I think its highly scandalous that you think it necessary to acquire phone calls for a ""health app"" when it has nothing to do with your health what so ever your just trying to spy on everyone using the apps you create, I haven't give you permission to monitor my calls and it won't allow me to use the app so for tht reason alone raises eyebrows and questions I reckon"
"I have been using App but it only show Weekly Averages based based on days of working out and Never the Totals. May this app be updated to show weekly, monthly, yearly totals or workouts and not just averages. I do not want to use the Huawei Health App on my Samsung. Please may you have totals."
"Worked for years now will not. The stress wont work, nor will the oxygen or heart rate. It will freeze, force close. Stopped around march 11th. The pedometer works, the heartbeat icon by itself works. I have oxygen issues, and stress, so I used the stress, oxygen, heart combo daily. Fix this please and I will change rating."
"I have been a loyal samsung device fan for 13 years... but this terrible terrible, and from what I can see, pointless update to Samsung Health has made me look at a different supplier for my next phone. This is a real own goal for samsung and sadly reflects a disconnect between samsung and their customers... don't download it...."
"Works fairly well, but on occasion stops counting steps and is a pain resetting. Wouldn't use it if it wasn't free. Has dropped steps partway through the day too."
Its not as sensitive as before when counting steps and does not record my running sessions as healthy pace. This problem started since your latest update a few days ago. So frustrating. I might reconsider buying samsung smart watch.
I love the app and use it daily. Not sure why but my step history for last three days is gone from trends. I still see daily activity trends for my active minutes but nothing for steps. It is obviously impacting my weekly and monthly averages as well. Not sure how to fix. Thanks.
"The app broke down suddenly after patch or update asking me for 2 step authorisation. Multiply errors occur, no ID, no Internet, wrong password. Though all my details are correct and I have internet. Uninstalled, found a new app."
"Now, Samsung Health needs access to my call history and to make calls. Why. This is supposed to be a fitness app. Why do you need access to my call history. I'm done with this. If you can clearly explain why you need access to this information for any other reason than profiling for advertisement, I would agree, but it makes absolutely no sense. Enough is enough. Edit : you still didn't answer why the app needs this access."
Absolutely loved this app until the update. I have a heart condition so being able to check my pulse and O2 regularly was nice. Now I can't even get access to the app without giving permission for a feature that I won't even use. Please change this.
The stress tracker stopped working. It accurately measures pulse and pulse ox but the stress level is always low. Even when I'm put jogging it says low. I know it's not right
"Had my samsung active watch a yr now and never had any problems, now it's not syncing. It attempts to sync steps but not doing it now. I've updated it twice still nothing. It's the whole reason I purchased the watch"
I've been using Samsung health for a while now on my phone. Recently it has not been tracking my steps correctly. I am not sure how to correct this. It seems to have happened after the last update. Any suggestions? I would like to continue using Samsung Health but if it is not going to work properly I will use LG Health instead.
"It's not letting me sign in, when trying to sync my account it comes back with processing failed. Therefore all the app does is count my steps. It doesn't let me add my friends or compete with others. please help me :("
"Not happy with ur past and recent changes.....like the HR measure feature, there was a Body Oxygen measurement feature....why was this removed?? Is especially valuable now during the Covid to monitor this essential body fn.......also took away the healthy pace accumulator recently.....it accumulated all totals for every 10+ minute walks and/or continuous movements.....not make sense to remove these features as valuable messurements in daily monitor of activity....."
"It seems once I created a personal food item, there's no way to go back to edit or delete it. Which is unfortunate, sometimes I would want to come back to my personal item to edit it, when I obtain more information about it. Please add this feature to this app"
"Why is heart rate and stress monitor removed from the S20 series? Is this another lame attempt to buy the wearables :( Payed so much money especially coming from the S10 series. Didn't really have to ""upgrade"" my phone but did it anyway as I am tech geek but man this is really annoying. Not the way to treat your customers. For me this feels like a cheapshot."
"Yeah, it's really unfortunate, this app used to work well, but now the GPS tracking is completely useless, when GPS tracking in another fitness app works on the same device, so I know it's definitely software and not Hardware."
I have to edit this.. It absolutely does not count steps if your phone is in your pocket.... But! It does work if you swing your arms while dancing lol. Thus is with my s6 plus I'm using a Huawei so may affect app but it misses most of my steps and is pointless. Gotta be something better out there?
"PLEASE READ! Used to love this app, especially as a Samsung Active 2 Watch user. I switched from the Garmin app to Samsung Health because of the watch. But now I find myself wanting to change to a Huawei watch AND phone just because Samsung Health is so difficult to use. I CANNOT CONNECT Samsung Health to Myfitnesspal, NOR Mapmyfitness, NOR Google Fit. As a Samsung user since S4, I honestly hope to stick with Samsung phones and watches, but linking Health with other apps is so difficult."
"The Health Together Challenges are plagued by cheaters which ruins competition and takes away fun factor. First day of new challenges and leaders have a constant step count of 3 steps per second and 200km per day. Not sure why Samsung won't detect and filter this out of competitions. The app doesn't even allow us to report cheaters, only fake profile pictures."
they removed oxygen saturation to be combined with stress measurement however i have tried on my s10 and s7 to test my oxygen saturation level each time i click stress the app freezes after i place fingertip and crashes on both phones. normally i would be alright with this but with this COVID-19 scare it would put me at peace of mind to see my levels on my phone. and not have to go about in the most illogical and round about way possible to do so. (i know if i feel sick to contact my doctor)
I enjoy using this app to monitor my health stats. They should have options to create workout routines. Including features like Jefit or Strong app into the Samsung health would be great. Also logging food using barcode would be great. This would truly make Samsung health stand out. Basically i don't want to use MyFitnessPal or another app to talk to Samsung health.
Don't know what's happened with this app. We have two samsung s9+ which updated last week. Now we only get our steps counted each day but not saved... We can't see yesterday data but both of us can see days prior to 4th October.. please fix this
"Overall the app is good. But in my sister's motorola mobile, she downloaded the app and working great. But in my samsung mobile, where the apl was installed by default, i was unable to add Indian food items. Even after un install and reinstall, the problem persist."
"No information available if you do not give it phone permission ~""to connect u with others"". Just want to know how far I walked, they don't need to use phone to do that. Going back to pedometer and writing down. This is my phone, not theirs to just collect data on me."
"It's not tracking my steps accurately. I did 10 km today, it says I did about 1. I can't add calories per 100 grams but only per serving. Very unintuitive app, I am shocked that this is a Samsung app and it's so poor."
I've been using this app with my galaxy watch for 6 months happily. But today it tells me it is not connected to any accessory and will no longer find it. The watch is connecting to my phone without issue but this app is not. Not happy!
I use this app every day to track my steps so I know how much exercise I've done. Since the last update it's stopped keeping record of my steps for the last few days. It only shows me how many steps I done for today and the next day the record of the past few days since the update is gone. It's such a shame because I loved knowing how I'm doing every week. Please can you fix it?
Loved this app before. Since the last update it does not work at all for me. I cannot open the app because every time I do it closes it straight away. Disappointed as I was considering upgrading to the galaxy watch active and will not be now due to app not working.
"New version is terrible. Doesn't record steps or time properly anymore. Also, tiny font. V hard to read. Used to love large numbers to see my time walked at a glance. Please fix!"
"I downloaded this app to accompany my Galaxy Active 2 watch. I literally cannot log in to even do anything. I enter my credentials and it just spins. I've tried every ""work around"" I can find, but I still can't get in."
"tcalorie tracker part of the app doesn't have full nutritional information on the products and just has the simple fat, protein and carbs. i spend too much time just to find the product that will have all the information such as vitamins and potassium etc. for example I would search Brazil nuts and there would be a variety but only one of them will have the complete info"
"After one ui 5, sleep tracking is not working properly. It almost didn't any sleep"
"This app assumes old phone will be functional and therefore will not be available if using new phone, can't phone premium numbers either. Purportedly burn 47 cals for 90 minutes I don't get that I walk 6000 steps a day. I haven't gained the predicted half a pound a week. To be fair its closer to 2000 steps a day. I assume I do other things talking/fidgeting. May demotivate people from exercise. I'm moderately hypothyroid and no weight issues so probably a bit off."
"2 months since update and treadmill app still not working properly! The treadmill doesn't work. Said 19 calories burned for 41 minutes when I typically burn 400 an hour. I literally count calories with food intake and what I burn in a day, but haven't been able to now in over a month. NEW UPDATE DID NOT FIX THE PROBLEM WITH THE TREADMILL APP!! I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHAT I'M BURNING USING THE TREADMILL. WTH! ..How long until you fix the treadmill app? It worked perfectly until the last update."
"App unusable now as it requests to use the phone which is in no way something that should be required. Even if you force 2fa there are other means to do so without a health app having access to the phone. Update: You can ""provide an optimal experience"" by not requiring unnecessary permissions that prevent the app from working. Health apps do not need phone access - 2FA or no 2FA."
"I used to love this app but since the upgrade I can't sync with my Discovery Health app. I have delinked both, relinked and checked that permissions are all on but it still isn't working. Help!"
App is terrible. Consumes battery like crazy. Seriously? For one gear fit 2 pro device three or four apps are required. Else this will not work. Is Samsung still in 90's app development? Can't you integrate in one single app? Developers are not smart enough to do that or is Samsung not willing to invest in that direction? I don't understand.
"It's a great app and it's user experience is sleek and smooth, I also appreciate the auto sleep tracker ,however like fitbit I want a messaging system within samsung health app so I can share things with my friends even if I'm not with them because of covid"
"Used to use app regularly, now latest update first forces you to grant phone permissions (you can't proceed unless you allow so basically no choice at all) then forces set up of 2 step identification. That gets stuck in a loop sending me a code, I then hit verify and it says it has to set up 2 step identification and sends me a code, when I hit verify it says I have to set up 2 step ID and sends me a code.. Useless app now!"
"I use this app everyday. It is a great app. Please add spinning or indoor cycling as an option for exercise. The cycling option and electric bike option is not the same as indoor cycling/spinning. I also wish I could take my blood pressure with the current watch I own, a Samsung Galaxy Watch (21BE) Model SM-R815U."
It is a good app. The food tracker is a little bit off. The stats for the food items I eat regularly don't quite match up to the labels.
"Really great app and very intuitive. It's fluid and easy to use. I like it even more than google fit, but please add a dark mode to it. I'm on android 10 and it hurts to see that this app does not support that feature"
Nice App not as involved as a Strava or myFitnessPal but fun and easy to use especially if you want to join in the step count global competition I have a galaxy watch and phone and the watch does work really well with the app. Still use Strava for running and cycling.
the app does not register my workouts . then there is no way to manually update my workouts. I do a lot of circuit training there is no setting for that. I use my gear s2 and it doesn't track automatically.
***********fix the auto Swim tracking option in the app. The app itself drains all the power from my watch in one day. The automatic swim starts ends and restarts all day every day. FIX IT!!!! I have contacted Samsung directly. Nice people. THE APP SUCKS!!!
"Easy to use, good information regarding exercise, cals used, heart rate with information on calorie burn rate I.e. aerobic ect. Good for keeping daily record of calories eaten but do miss the information if you have taken too many calories or are under. Enjoy taken part in the monthly challenge."
I liked this app but the food tracking was terrible because it has limited selection and no barcode scanner so I used to track my calories from my fitness pal and it would sync to my Samsung health but now it no longer syncs with My Fitness Pal thus my calories are not showing up.
"They blocked my access because I refused to give them permission to access my contacts, phone, location, photos, camera etc. I have uninstalled it. I think the end of Samsung has began with this attitude. Should know the power of the customer."
"Heart rate monitor on my S10 doesn't work since the latest Android update, making this app mostly useless. I will absolutely *not* be buying a wearable device from Samsung if this was done intentionally or doesn't get fixed."
"I wish they had more challenges for family and friends. That way it's a more enjoyable and competitive way to workout with others. That is my only suggestion, other than that the app is great!"
Earlier it was working great but after the update it is not syncing properl with my galaxy watch. It says syncing may take some time.. And after that it's says cannot sync... My morning work out get update by afternoon...
"Not working. Unable to sign in. Asking to setup two factor, but won't allow to verify text code unable to skip process without it coming up with an error. Time to start looking for a new watch."
"Guys this app is giving me headaches. My workout data is not pulling through from Strava. Ive contacted strava because i thought it was their app thats the problem, but it seems to be the samsung health app. I see all my workouts pulling through from strava to virgin active app, but its not appearing on my samsung health app. My medical aid is supposed to collect data from my samsung health app from which i get rewarded my points and benefits. Guys this is not the first time im complaining."
"I have enjoyed this app for many months but following the last update my Watch3 does not sync heart rate, spO2, ECG, steps. In fact nothing syncs. Re-installed the app several times. Restarted my phone and Watch3 many times. Disappointed."
"Auto workouts at intermittent. When my favorite activity is skiing or snowboarding and I am at a ski resort during winter I would expect you to know what I am doing and not count uphill chairlift rides as exercise, and stop when I start driving away from the resort at a high rate of speed when I forget to stop the workout. Similarly with biking/ mountain biking as I never reach 50 mph unless I am driving in a car. There is no way that I see to edit the incorrect tracking when I forget too..."
"I have done as you've asked but it still doesn't work. I use Samsung galaxy s8, now almost all sensors don't work (gyroscope, heart rate sensor, and it's not just me, a lot 9f people with s8 and note 8 have been complaining too about all these problems. Please Samsung send an update to take care of this."
"I use to use this app all the time until a few months ago it just stopped working. My phone is only a few months old so this shouldn't happen. I tried updating, I've looked in settings if there is a data error. Not happy at all."
This app used to work much better but the creators decided to screw it up. Now it totally sucks
"The App is excellent for tracking individual results and allowing you to compete with others, including family and friends in health ""Challenges"". The App allows for dual sync between steps completed with your phone and Samsung Gear S3."
consolidated app for health data. no longer plays well with others. dont know if this is Samsung's choice or other bluetooth devices. this is one of four apps instead of a single go to source.
"After a fewonths, the voice guide goes silent... there's a bug in the app. Kindly assist. Otherwise, very happy with the app. Is there a way to adjust the stride length?"
"I can't believe they took away the ability to track your weight by month -- that's the only feature I used. Not only is it gone, but so is all my historical data. A big blow to my health management."
"Why did you take away the heart rate and stress monitors?!?! Upgrades shouldn't include noticeable downgrades. Still, it's a nice enough app. Maybe I'll look into the workouts and sleep / meditation features..."
App is very good In my Note 3 only feature missing is ambient temperature and measuring humidity which was there in earlier version its suddenly got disappear after updating the app I request to add it back for compactible handsets in upcoming update only after that I can rate 5 stars.
This app is great but it doesnt always let me log my runs on the treadmill. I go to emter the data and it does not save. Very frustrating. And I do not believe it tracks my steps accurately.
It stopped showing my sleep schedule. I no longer have the REM and other sleeping charts. Cannot find a way to re-install those charts. It only provides me with how long I slept and if I snore.
"Samsung software updates should be called, Removal of Features and Convenience and Accuracy. Also known as ""downdates"". I'll be sure to email you at noreply.sec@..... No Reply ! Apple looking better and better. At the very least, different Android hardware, because Samsung listens to nobody. I do not want a smartwatch. I was happy to get rid of watches when I started with so-called smartphones. You guys are not going to force me to buy one. Long time customer, fading away from you............"
I am so done with this app! I was on my glider (cross country type machine) for 32 minutes this morning. This app recorded only 6 minutes. Never had a problem until the last update. Please fix it!
"I love this app, it actually at one point inspired me to eat more often and track what I'm consuming, super easy to use, addicting, and useful for tracking physical activity and fixing a sleep schedule."
Very very useful for city people
"Pointless now it doesn't do your blood and oxygen - they were a lifesaver during Covid, now I don't even use it."
"Squeaky progress voice, please change"
"Please let you restart a workout if you ""finish"" it."
Said there was an update on terms...now I can't get on the appü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
"I only used it for steps, wanted to remove that from my alerts. Clicked and saw this update?? Wants ability to make and manage calls n contacts?? After reading most recent reviews I agree and I am now removing. Your generic automated responses are also laughable. I love my Samsung phone, but not the intrusions. BTW the Refrigerators you make SUCK n you screwed so many out of $1000's by not recalling them or fixing during the warranty period."
"Weak tracker I can't believe how basic informing the app is with tracking my activity. Hey Samsung, open your wallet and invest some money into this app"
I've lost all my data from all my exercises when getting a new phone .....:/
Just we need experts to supported in Europe PLEASE because it's so important to have it! Thanks
"You ask to much of us, who cares about the social aspect of this app.. Can we just simply get healthy without giving up privacy ?"
"Removed SP02 sensor in Canada on year old device, stress tracker is not available in canada but the sensor was disabled regardless. I would give this 0/5 stars if possible. I currently hold onto an outdated apk of this app to use my spo2 sensor because the stress tracker is again, still disabled in Canada. It's awful these days that you can just have hardware on your phone remotely disabled by devs arbitrarily deciding end users don't own their device. Samsung doesn't own this device. I do."
"My app suddenly does not open any more! After Continue in the information message with ""Privacy Notice has been updated"" It says ""Samsung account session expired. Sign in to Samsung account again"" . My Samsung account is active on my phone so where to sign in again? Can be because the reason I did not acccept access to Phone calls regarding the Privacy changes?!"
"My steps are counting when I am travelling on bike, bus Fix the bugs"
Helped and keep helping me with my diabetic control.
"it seems that there is a bug in app or problem. in my samsung galaxy sport watch it was showing i burnt 1855 kcl and was showing 3546 steps. but, when i connect it to my app it was 25580 kcl and was showing 4247 steps. this all happened within 10 minutes. which makes the app useless even if we have smart watch."
it's database doesn't include a lot of the foods from Aldi and Save a Lot. It would be helpful if it could read bar codes. As well as communicate with other fitness apps.
Pulse and 02 features are gone
After update my sleep is no longer tracked. Which was the main reason i used it
"Everytime they update this app they take away the parts I actually use. Bring back active time, bring back calories burnt. Daily activity is overcomplicated and doesn't display anywhere as easily to read."
Not working Server error occurs
Not working properly from last 2days
Unable to get on new phone
"Absolutely! Originally, avoided... thought this is one of those re-installed, bloatware apps. Ended up loving the app so much downloaded it on other non-samsung phones. ie Google and LG... and dont worry it has gps to log your runs, walk, trail biking even your kick ass tennis match! HR, resp, stress detuning, food reality check-in's, you got it!!! Pkease take the time to learn about this app; believe tou me iit is 10 apps in one!"
Not happy with the phone has to be enabled update. Wish I had read these comments before updating. Now can't access anything without agreeing and definitely will not. Should be able to deny phone calls and still see your data. Very disappointed.
Why did you get rid of the wings for your level???? Please bring them back!!!
I compare to my smart watch always samsung health 600 to 800 steps more showes
Last update is too bad I want to watch my steps in the notifications
"I love the app however I find it doesn't calculate food's energy in kj, it only provides the option for kcal measurement"
"It's nice,but it doesn't show the ECG!"
Snoring detection stopped working with S23 Ultra and Watch5
This started as a great app for recording health statistics. This apple has been polished to death and become useless. I have a Samsung watch which restricts what I can enter manually from more reliable tools. I'll be looking for a new app.
This app used to be my favourite but with every new update it gets worse. Now it doesn't even seem to track excercise properly the auto walking tracking feature has not been working properly.
New redesign is very bad. Not user friendly. For example to enter my excersise data i require many clicks and still its very hard to find where to click. I will not use this app till i get a better update
Can't get maps of exercise on this üò´
"I've used this app foreeeever! It's always been on point and reliable until recently. It's not tracking my running activity, it's counting as walking. When you're running at 4.4 to 4.7 with a heart rate of 160 to 166 BP, clearly something is awry. Big whomp!"
Inaccurate since I updated. Sensitive to movement of my phone when measuring distance. Speed measuring varies dramatically when speed is consistent. Great app before this recent update.
2 days ago step counter stopped working no idea why i haven't changed anything
Error may 0x2700001 Trouble shooting failed
"Good but has a lot of confusing information. For example if I go out for a jog it'll have 2 calorie counts, and 2 distance counts - both are not even close to each other. Done an early morning jog before and said calories 1200 calories burned 200 which one is it? I haven't burned 1200 calories from getting out of bed and putting clothes on. Think it needs a bit of work in that sense. Otherwise pretty decent"
"Great, honestly the only thing I would ask to be added would be temperature tracking. U now have glucose, blood pressure and menstrual. Only other important one in temperature. I realise updating apps isn't super easy but please consider this feature"
something wrong after update. how come less than 250 calories burned after 6600 steps by a 107 kg person in 71 minutes distance covered over 4.8 kms
"ZERO STARS! I deleted this garbage app after having it for a long time due to Samdumb kept removing features. Plus the ads...ridiculous. After deleting this app, I get constant notifications to reinstall S Health. HELL NO! Matter of fact as soon as I pay this Samdumb phone off I am officially divorcing myself from anything Samdumb. Today I'm replacing my Samdumb Galaxy watch for a Garmin. And the watch is going in a drawer or the trash. Divorce proceedings are beginning today."
For some reason it wont open on my s23 ultra....
"it no longer tracks heart rate, blood oxygen, or stress levels. Decontented version doesn't track these key data points. This app is no longer useful."
"I use to really love this app .could keep track of heart rate ,stress and O2 levels üëå..but since last update can't use any of the features except sleep üò¥ ..Really hope Samsung adds these great features back soon .was my favorite part of galaxy S10"
I am not sure why this app doesn't have women's health tracker anymore.
I love this app i love the features and everything
Overall works well. Not 5 stars because I just cant find a way to get all my exact heart rate reading. It's easy to export hourly min/max/average but not the raw measurements visible in the continuous graph.
"Since I have been using the app, it tracks the wrong direction"
"like it. very easy to track everything you do, plus workouts. good to keap motivated. only thing that would make it better is bar code scanning to add foods eaten."
App keeps instant crashing and as a result I could not sync data from my Galaxy Watch at all
"I really liked the app itself. The layout is great, and I like how it pairs with my Samsung watch. I really wish they would do something about the people who are clearly cheating on the group challenges."
What happened???? It used to work. Now it doesn't even count my steps. Actually useless now.
"Just bought a $260 Samsung watch and want to be able to use the basic sleep/health software that's pre-installed on the watch. Turns out, to do that I have to install this same software on my phone...ok, still fairly normal. But to use the software, they require a Samsung account made with information using my date of birth and address?!?! All I want to do is use the watch that I've already paid for! Sadly, I'll probably do it because there is no other option... But there should be."
"Today I walked continuously for 55 mins but steps calculated were in 3 different cycles. Since there was no break during the walk, it should show single walk of 55 mins instead of 3 records. This scenario has been noticed multiple times."
"I used to love this app. The step counter worked in the background all the time and the exercise part monitored my movement accurately. Now, nothing works. I have a Xiaomi, and before that Huawei Nexus, but I always used Samsung Health. Not anymore. It's useless."
"Agree with Joel Diester. With the recent update, need all sort of permission just to open the app. Why do they need access to my contacts data and phone? They going to call all my friends/clients to tell them how good is my health??? I see no relevance why they need my contact data. The app developer answer to Joel's comment is a joke. In light of all data privacy issues this is the dumbest move by Samsung."
It's not counting all of my steps anymore. When I'm on the elliptical it doesn't count my steps. It used to. Please fix! Actually it's my Galaxy watch 4 that's not counting my steps. I'm wearing my watch while doing the elliptical workout but my phone is sitting on a table nearby. Can you help me with this?
I keep getting an error when trying to open the app. I have used this for years and now with recent updates it doesn't work. I used this many times working with horses and walking at work. Please fix!!
"Samsung has made many bad decisions to add asvertisements, force uninstallable bloatware, or collect data with their other apps. I can only assume there is something anti-customer being done in all their apps now."
It is an ok app. It is just rather disappointing that I can't add exercises to the app. The exercises listed barely are a representation of the many exercises available.
"Hi, can not find anywhere information about my daily steps count from one or two days earlier, I can see weekly summary and I found daily summary, but it shows only how many kilometres in total I had walked in that day, but no steps count. Is it my problem that I can't find it or there isn't any way to see daily summary and past days history, please fix it or make the information more easy to find and in one logical place, thank you!"
"It works well, but with a previous update, major changes were made. I miss being able to see my weight change over weeks and months instead of just days. I'd really love it if that was added again. Thanks!"
"I never thought something as helpful as this would even be real! Because of this app, I became mindful of my health, especially this quarantine season. It surprisingly has many features and are all useful. This app inspires me to be healthier. Thank you for this!"
"Love the app and all it's tracking abilities (food, water, steps and workouts). Disappointed that calorie/target weight goal feature has recently been removed."
I no longer own galaxy watch n it still shows up n i am trying to get my fitbit versa2 to show up on list so that i know it's synchronizing but it won't show nor count the versa2 steps in d equation so my Samsung health app is no longer accurate. I never cared for iphones but now i am thinking about returning the most expensive Samsung galaxy phone i own (since i was only given 60 days to return it if i am not happy with it) n getting an iPhone instead because i love my fitbits
"Stop displaying ads at the top!!!! I bought everything you make, so why preach to the choir. I'm furious I see big banner ads every time I track or look at my stats. Km about to leave Samsung for this reason alone. Also needs reports of yearly and monthly data. Luke swimming aggregates etc. It only shows single swims vs monthly and yearly data."
"Won't load up, keeps telling me to verify my number as it may be logged in to another device which is odd as I've had the same phone for 4 yrs.. just keep getting the little blue loading circle that never loads the page at all so I can't do anything at all with it."
this app is usually amazing. But I guess it updated recently and since it updated it says it can't connect to a rooted phone the first security purposes. I don't even know what a rooted phone is. please fix this!
Lost the o2 sensor ability plus when I'm wearing my Google fit it'll just randomly start me on a bike ride while driving. Another app that don't realize more is less when it comes to compact and useful apps.
Unlike my old s7 I can't measure with my finger on the sensor my heartbeat and stress levels which was very important to me as was the blood oxygen saturation this new update is completely useless to me . Completely dissatisfied. Can I download an older version. ?
The sleep function is the most important to me and since the last update I hardly ever get any data. If I have to get up with my baby during the night I can't access any data prior to that. Very disappointing.
"Used to be the best health app. But latest update has rendered it ABSOLUTELY USELESS, by removing core functionality for weight management and calorie tracking. Like, why remove such important features like those, that most people will use? Makes no sense."
Your ability to manage this app is bordering on surveillance. To many permissions for an app that is for heath stuff. I'm Uninstalling and never using again. After asking for phone calls and contacts was the final straw.
I've been using this app for almost three years and one of the futures I used the most was the weight management when I updated to this version I found out it wasn't there. So please bring that future back cause it was really helpful and important to me. Once you guys bring it back I'll give you 5 stars again.
I had been able to see my step count on my home screen for years. Now all I see is your logo that tells me to reinstall. The app still works otherwise and I don't want to lose my stored data.
"Everything is amazing, but I want to have more statistic about water intake! For example time, how many glasses I drunk yesterday and so on... And also I want to add my own data about how many calories I burnt... It is really hard sometimes to add my own workout info, thank you a lot!"
"this app is brilliant. measurements are accurate and there are loads of features. I use it every time I'm out in the mountains! I thought the O2 saturation had disappeared, but I was quickly informed by the creators that it's still there as part of another measurement! so it's 5* from me."
It is impossible to log in into the app. It gets stuck by the step with the verification code. Also i receive the code from diffrent suspicios numbers.. Also i can not update my Samsung watch. Is there a bug in the latest version? Are the Samsung apps not supported anymore on huawei devices?
I enjoy using this app it has made me become more active by keeping track of my steps and monitoring my general health. I've been a Samsung Health user since the S5 back then it would not keep your steps accurately and it used up your battery life very quickly. The new app with all of its improvements just keep getting better and better
"Everytime I try to use Health Connect, it gives me an error I can't fix."
"I'm very thankful for this app. As a person with congenital disabilities it gives me something to challenge myself, while still listening to my body and its signals. Thank you and I truly look forward to any/all motivations and on-going support."
"43kg down this year using S health with my fitness pal to track nutrition + activity. A few gripes would be, the need to use MFP to make tracking calories workable. Challenges are too easy + only count steps not cycling or other. I have the galaxy active watch but also a formal Wear os watch which i must use a 3rd party app to sync activity as no s health app on Wear os now samsung is stopping 3rd party app syncing steps making the wear os watch useless for health tracking üò¢ thanks Samsung!"
I can't understand why my data from my old phone didn't transfer. Not only that now that I'm trying to open this app it won't allow me access. It keeps telling me to go to settings I go through settings come back and it just keeps going in circles. Why does it have to be so difficult
App is not syncing with Strava! It doesn't pull the data across to strava which is very frustrating. It use to take a few hours but now it isn't working at all!
"Why is Samsung removing features? It had a good Oxygen Saturation measurement before and it was removed in the last versions. It is a good thing to have in these Covid times so I can't understand why it was removed. Edit: I'm in Canada, so the given solution to use the Stress tracker doesn't work for me."
It's a core part of my Samsung usage. It could improve on the way data is collected particularly in data stored in wearables that are only downloaded after the deadline of a time sensitive challenges.
"I bought the note 20 ultra and alot of the things on Samsung health no longer work. Can't Track heart beat , stress or blood oxygen levels anymore. They are still listed on the app but they don't function. I loved the app on my old note phone Please bring back those functions"
"It was a great app until it updated and now wants to manage and make my phone calls. Seems shady I can't use it anymore without giving it permission to do so. I will delete app and no longer buy samsung smart watches. Next new phone will not be a Samsung. I am so glad I backed information up to Lifesum app, a better app now because of the update. Who ever thought this was a good idea should be fired, the internet is full of angry people. Samsung you suck!"
"Used to love this app. Now it just keeps closing. Not tracking biking or walking. Can't track heart rate, weight, nothing. As soon as I open it, it shuts down after 2 secs or so. Can't use it at all."
I have installed this app in my vivo phone and it's keep closing after few mins and stopped to count the steps. If this app is only works in Samsung phone then mention that clearly it won't work in other mobile models. I have tried all settings in app and phone but no use
"Doesn't have longer term weight graph anymore. Samsung, bring it back! Also only automatically picks up about half my long walks. Doesn't integrate with my Beurer Bluetooth scale."
"I use this app in both my samsung phone and my galaxy watch 3. I really like it and use it daily, but I would just appreciate if you could add more difficult fitness programs for advanced runners, harder than the run 10k. Thanks for your efforts."
I loved it until today when i added 20 minutes of exercise i did with my daughter and it didnt count towards exercise. Missing 20 minutes because i had to add data manual....really sad as im trying to hit my workout goal every day and will be 20 minutes behind. Makes me sad....especially since this app has already helped me loss weight
"after - more than 7.3 million power walk steps - regularly using the app for couple of years, i can recommend this to everyone but; after my phone was stolen i did get a better one (exchanged phone number too ..)and here trouble begins -I'm not being able to use none of my samsung related accounts .at all .because I have a new phone number...sadly samsung refuses me for access to my accounts(samsung can't change phone number; they don't even know how ?!?!! yes ,I've met people from the company‚ìÇÔ∏è"
"it is a very good app and use it a lot to track all my fitness. the only shame is that the activity level doesn't reflect on steps, I go for a big cycle but doesn't account for anything on steps."
"It seems I'm not the only one here that is refusing to give up my phone book details and ect. It's absolutely disgusting and infuriating that we can not use samsung devices to theyr full extent because of samsungs disgusting racketeering for personal information. If you don't intend to use any of my phone book and such information, then you don't need it. I promise you, that I will never buy any of the samsung product ever again."
Why do I need a mobile network data plan to use this? It WILL NOT EVEN START on a wifi connection. Allow logging food for the next day. I have a different set of times for what I count for each day and I need to be able to log things for breakfast at night.
Used to be great but now I have to sign in and allow unrelated permissions for it to run. I see so many people complaining about the same issues. Samsung - just remove these permission requirements instead of telling us they will not be used. Nobody believes you!
Since the new up-date all it does is give me a daily steps figure. I can't do anything else or even see my average daily steps. I'll have to uninstall I'd this is not sorted. Despite your response I still cannot do anything with the App apart from view my daily steps. I have lost all my history of steps.
worked great for me until after the latest update. now i am constantly getting error messages saying my phone is rooted and Samsung health will not open. have had tech support try to resolve this issue with no avail. their advice was to to a FDR and i weighed the options of doing the FDR and with having to go through and redo all my family link for my kids and me i can live without this app
"No pulse oximeter. I read a response from Samsung rep, in reply to another reviewer with the same problem, that the pulse ox is under the stress measurement, but like her, I do not see a stress measurement anywhere. I did click ""Manage items"" to add more measurements, but it's not there. Uninstalling it now."
"Lads, the weight management feature was a crucial part to the app. For anyone in serious training etc....it was vital to aid any sort of training and then puff! Its gone!!! BRING IT BACK PLEASE!!!"
"The update to no longer allow being able to sync to 3rd parties, such as fitbit, has caused me to no longer use this app. I will never use again until able to use with fitbit."
The step counter has stopped working. In the past I ha e used it daily to get a semi accurate idea of my steps. Since mid November it has worked very randomly.. very disappointing!
Was using this to track steps for a while but can't anymore because samsung changed the app to overstep it's boundries on privacy. The app worked fine before without requiring the permissions to make and manage phone calls. Gross choice of actions by samsung.
"I find this app very helpful with tracking my sleep and steps. I do wish that it would total the weekly steps instead of just daily. So in the drop down, it gave you the ability to see your daily, weekly, and overall monthly steps."
"I hiked for a whole 10km the other day and the app apparently only recorded 1.54km. About 2 weeks ago, I hiked for 9.5km and it only recorded 3.4km. I use the app for my medical aid as well so that means I can't show how much I really work out and that means I'm losing out on a lot of points."
"Lacks ability to edit exercises captured by wearables. For instance, unable to add distance to rowing sessions. Good at biometrics, but not useful for measuring endurance and fitness progress"
What happened to oxygen saturation? It disappeared in the latest update. Removing it was really dumb. The stress measurement takes too long and is really useless. I guess I'll find another app to use.
"Samsung keeps playing with clients. We pay almost 1K euros for a phone with all sensors just to have heart rate and stress. t There are better apps o for that. Replying to Samsung, Oximeter and Blood pressure >> measuring << are gone. Recording is what to gave in replace, which is not much of use. Please stop laying to people and say that you will reply, and you're sorry for that issue. in 4 years nothing has changed. Not even your text ""we're sorry"" ""we'll tell our development team"" etc"
I had a request for the Samsung health app. I was wondering if it would be possible for you to add a widget for adding food that you're eating? You have one for the step counter but I think it'd be great to be able to have a calorie counter/calorie burned widget and a widget for adding food? Thanks!
Please stop changing the app I have been using it for years. When i stop for a quick second while working out the lady comes on with a ATTITUDE saying work out paused. Could we change her voice it wasnt like this a few weeks ago.
Ran more than 2000km... since deliberately starting to use. Don't need to do mental calculations. Did 4 million steps since having the phone. Succeeded to use to track from 0km to running full plus marathon distances. Magic.
"The latest update and accepting the new T&Cs on my S9+ no longer allows me to run the app. It says for security reasons the app can't run on a rooted phone, but I've not tried anything as such since I got it. Please fix!"
Can't manually enter blood O2 or pulse. I used to enter them manually after a Dr appt and at a note. I want that info in there so I can ensure my watch is correct. Please put manual entry back on everything. Used to be amazing now it's heavily relying on your watch. I don't wear my watch 24/7. I use a finger pulse ox and want to record. Ugh please bring the old version back
"I was told by someone that the reason why heart rate and others don't work anymore in the Samsung Health App, is because Samsung doesn't put an infrared sensor anymore in the camera unit on the backside of their phones. Why does Samsung not say that if that is the case / reason so I don't have to keep on trying with every update."
i just want to access the spo2 sensor. why should that need an account or adversising agreement? The response to feedback is effectively 'it is like that because that is how it is'. Legitimately a reason to not buy another Samsung phone if I'm risking paying for features that will have restrictions imposed in the future.
"I have been using this app for years. I am so disappointed that in its last update, i couldn't track my weight in different periods (weekly, monthly, ...). It is available only on daily base. I wonder why should this change be made ....."
The challenges are pretty basic when you move from fitbit. You can't invite multiple friends to the challenges. Adding friends is not possible unless you have their IDs.
"Samsung health requires your phone number!!! Unacceptable. To sell my data,where's my cut! I'll just use 3rd party app,that cares about my privacy!"
"This is an ok app but I would give it 5 stars if it could be synced directly with Noom since I have the Galaxy watch. But unfortunately it has to be synced with Google Fit since that is what Noom syncs with. But even then, I have to use a third party app to sync S Health to Google Fit. After all that, I find out that only the steps transfer to Google Fit from my Galaxy watch but not to Noom due to the way SH and GF save the data! Fix this glitch by syncing SH directly to Noom please!"
Because of the update I am unable to even log on to the ap. It keeps forcing me to step up 2 step verification. But won't send the sms. Then when I try to skip it it crashes. What is going on?!? And please don't tell me to call your US office because I am in the UAE
"This app is not allowing the connected apps to sync, discovery, my fitness pal, etc. None of the apps are syncing anymore. I have delinked and tried to link again and it's not working."
"Hi This application used to work relatively accurately, but it has been very error-prone for some time. The route that the return distance was previously announced with the same app about ten kilometers, now announces to me four kilometers or less."
Not as good as fitbit. That let's you record different activity if you weren't wearing the watch or carrying the phone. It also doesn't track periods etc. Samsung watch doesn't have a long battery life
"Yhis app requires you to aggree to share and store personal information including name, email, postcode, gps location, all data on your health including heart rate, blood pressure, weight, glucose levels, everything. Sorry, that is way too much to ask in my opinion. As a user I'd like to have some privacy and not submot all personal data to some company..."
"This app was very good, you could measure heart beat, spo2 and other things. Now it is totally impossible to do something in it. The truth is that it is a disaster.You killed this app with all the updates and removing the good things. Maybe you have to shut it off completely."
"This app seems really cool, however, it doesnt work on my phone. I cant even open it and I spent so much time contacting you guys and trying to fix it and yet still it doesnt work. It's frustrating dang."
"Was doing great as an app until i hiked a mountain. No data was collected, which was disappointing/discouraging for my progress and made me want to not use the app anymore and find a competitor."
"Had an issue with logging into the app, support are useless, but the issue was after sign in the loading screen comes up indefinitely, the fix was start as guest, then login then it works fine, app overall is alright."
"Excellent health tracker that I mostly use for steps, recording hikes, bike rides and tracking sleep and heart rates. Other benefits include together, which allows you to challange friends and take part in global challanges. I also used the meditate app Mind, which I access through this app and got 6 months for free. It works seemlessly with my galaxy fit2. This is a good already fitness app."
"I've been completely locked out for months. It won't sync with my Galaxy 3 watch anymore, most of the screens just have loading dots and never loads. Useless."
"There's a bug where when you go to log in with multifactor authentication the ""send code"" button is greyed out. Because of this I didn't know I had to press the button to get the code and assumed that Samsun wasn't sending the code. I lost access to my Samsung account for months because of this glitch. I only figured out today that I had to push the greyed-out button when I decided to try logging into Health and accidentally pushed the greyed-out button, which caused the code to be sent instantly..."
"Loving the app so far and hoping to get an active watch soon to help with tracking my fitness. My only request would to be given the ability to customize how many meals I have per day, as my diet requires me to have small main meals and more than one snack time."
"As a person who has had open heart surgery I was using this app to track my activity, heart rate and O2 to report to my doctor. Since the update the app fails to even stay open more than a few seconds and then crashes. It was nice while it lasted...now a brick app."
"[Update 9/27/2018] Updated to 5 stars. I was able to tweak my notifications. Thank you Samsung Developers, this app is great. [Original post] Good app, but *too many* notifications. I don't need alerts every hour or two about my progresss."
"I like the app. Some suggestions: - Add a note section or another item for listing all the medications you are currently taking. An addition of you can add categories within the note list (e.g. Meds for diabetes, etc) - Add custom exercises which can be considered as active activities (e.g. Cleaning, gardening, etc.)"
"I've been on and off using Samsung Health, just like how I've been on and off about optimizing my health. However, I've been consistently walking since the 27rh of November and have been using Samsung Health to track my steps, duration and speed every day. So far so good. It's now December 22 and I've accomplished over 200000 steps and I'm 10lbs lighter. Yay me"
PLEASE ADD MAP TRACKING FOR GROUP RUNNING. Otherwise a wonderful app. It allows me to record my runs and track them. There are also many wonderful exercising programs that I am now exploring. Thank you Samsung ElectronicsüôÇ
"Perfect app for keeping me healthy by tracking the steps walking every day, tracking my sleep pattern, letting me know average steps walks monthly, weekly. Most important feature is joining global challenge knowing how others are doing :) Only problem so far I see after Pie update, this app is not tracking steps accurately. Hope team brings an update very soon."
"I never write reviews on anything but I felt the need, as the most recent update (8/5) basically removed the only reasons why I use this app. If I cant track basic features like caffeine intake or weight management, then this really isn't a health app anymore...its more of a standard step counter."
"Eveything is good and very scientific based on WHO suggestions. One thing that samsung can add is that allow users to enter their BMR manually as well. Because all gyms have BMR machines and provide more accurate reading and once samsung app is able to use this reading then the entire data becomes more accurate. For eg, my current bmr is 1350 (i am diabetic) but the samsung app has taken my default bmr as 1550. If we dont enter then let it take automatically."
"I used to like this app, but the last update is a show stopper. I will not allow this app to make phone Calls on my money and there is no reason an able programmer would need this far a App like this. An this stupid excuse they give ""user experience"". First You could ask whenever you want to access the privilege, but disabling the app as a whole?"
"Missing functionality: I purchased Watch 4 to measure stress/oxygen level/blood pressure. None of these functions appear to be available. I can manually record data, but to *measure* button appears."
Latest update doesn't let the user to customize tile to be smaller like previous UI. Too bulky horizontally and takes longer to access exercises from home page. Thumbs down on September update.
"So, what is the point of this app? I'm a new user and this app seems to be useless. The Sleep feature doesn't do anything. I left Fitbit, hoping this would be better. Unfortunately, this seems to be a step back. Why do I need 3 apps and grant so many permissions just to track my fitness? I don't."
"Can't open app, cleared cache I get the same, clear data restart, go thru all setup still nothing"
Used to like this for counting my steps but the calories burnt is always super inaccurate and now it's affecting my calorie count on my fitness pal and it's super annoying :( wish there was a way to disconnect that part of the app!
Works very well with my Fitbit Charge. Easy to use and vital to my weight loss. Needs better ability to figure out when sleep ends. Usually 3 hours wrong. Keeps track of other interesting info.
Samsung Health WANTS to Control my phone... LOL... N O T! *Then why request such permissions? The ONLY permission required is When Activated & Location.. these two features All users to Control & Monitor their own progress!.. Just tried to reinstall... it states Access optional. Not required to Use app. Not True.
"I love the app! I find challenges, exercises, articles and all for free. And also is connected to my Samsung watch, so it's easy keep tracking my progress from both."
"Great fitness app, the statistics and biometrics it provides to users motivate people to stay healthy. It's very useful in my opinion! But can you add support for the new Blood pressure sensor in the Note 9 and S9??"
"Pretty good overall. Update on 2/19/21 caused sleep tracker to stop working. It ""couldn't get sleep records from my phone."" I haven't changed any settings. I hope they fix this."
"Accidentally hit back while registering my account. Now every time that I open the app it immediately crashes saying it was unable to setup the app. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app, but no fix."
"Ever since the last update, my walking or running workouts keep auto pausing. It's extremely frustrating because I don't always notice right away and then most of my workout wasn't logged."
Cant even log in to use my new watch. It's been a month now. Tried all the fixes mentioned and nothing works. Might as well roll the update back if it makes the program unusable.
Nice app but seems like since this last update I'm having problems synching with MyFitnessPal. It no longer wants to upload my recorded exercises in this app over to the MyFitnessPal app. (UPDATE AS OF 3/01 - Seems to be working now.)
Can't use another app while workout is active or what? Is skateboarding/longboarding not enough of an exercise to even consider it as an option. I board almost 2 hours a day and it doesn't get tracked.No option for it in the settings...
Cannot manually enter bpm. My phone does not have a the red light scanner and a dont want a fitness tracker. This is such a simple thing. What the hell? So stupid. Everything else works fine.
"Not user-friendly. When asking to sign the accept the agreements and terms, can't find that at least the check mark box anyhow that lets you actually complete the setup process. Very frustrating"
Just got a Gear s3 classic I don't find this app very informative with the watch. Its very mediocre. Would like to see more of a customisation for watch users. Would be good to see the info on the watch go directly to the app. Such as excersizes done.
"This app is very handy, I love using it I have used it for over a year now. My main issue and i think i spoke poorly on my last review. Is that it they dont update food. Like it doesnt have mangosteen or Milo ceral or salmon onigri etc which is a major inconvenience when trying to use the app and track calories. Because the only way to track the food they dont list is to add them as custom foods and manually inter the food nutritional information."
"Been tracking my steps with this app for about 3 years now. I really like it. I manage 10,000 steps a day about 80% of the time. I'm a 51 yo female. Took time to work up to that distance. Please Samsung Health send me a summary of how many steps and miles I walked this year!!!!"
"(EDIT: Did you... Did you just ruined the app?! latest version seems like it's infected with malware! Ads in step count screen! Seriously? I already have ads in Samsung Max... it's so annoying to see ads in stock apps! Seems like Samsung is going Xiaomi way. And I'm going Nokia way on my next purchase.) then stock health app of Xiaomi, Huwai, Apple and Google. Some better alternatives are available on store but all of them are subscription based. THIS ONE IS TOTALLY FREE! THANKS SAMSUNG!"
Terrible! The hr tracking data is the worst. Yes it's nice to see a min and max but what about the AVERAGE!!???!!! That is more important! If you are at 120 90% of the time and 60 10% of the time then you won't know you are about to stroke out! Please fix this!
You can increase the level of achievements. So it's more interesting when there are more levels to achieve. On s20 does not work stair steps. Most floors are disactive
"It is a good apps before update, but after updated to the latest version, it cant record any activities.. When i was trying to sign in, the page all turn to other language that i cant understand, nowhere to change the language either, can someone please fix it?"
"Although present on Samsung phones and running in background, you can not see app content unless you sign up for a Samsung acct. I didn't even want to sign up w google but, like billions of other android phone users, was forced to sign up otherwise I could not use the phone; so don't want to have another data mining co. access my info"
"Bring back third party integration - still running version 5.17 where you can send data to Runkeeper for example and not just Strava Samsung consistently tries to get people inside their ecosystem, which is a shame. The S Health is one of the best, but this pursuit gets Samsung nowhere."
"Update 08/07/20: was 5 star but recent update makes it 1 star as they removed the most useful item - the calore target widget that showed where you were tracking based on your goals. Samsung, this makes this nothing more than a journal and not something that can help people reach goals. Please add this back."
"The exercise 'running' option has a bug. When checking the running splits for the minutes per mile, it shows 'Distance km' when it should be 'Distance miles', as the times are correct for miles, not km."
"Prior version picked up my sleep data from Fitbit, but that ceased with this update. If this version retains that functionality, I've yet to find the setting to reenable it."
Just got a smart watch...can't even install this app in my phone it is way too large and takes up too much space. It says it is going to take 30 minutes to install into my brand new phone!!! I HAVE A BRAND NEW GALAXY Z FLIP WITH PLENTY OF STORAGE ON IT. THAT IS NOT THE ISSUE.
Experience could be better by adding a bar code scanner when logging food/calorie intake. It would make the app more user friendly rather than having to search for food or have it as a favourite
"Samsung Health... it's not necessary to screw up a good thing! Seriously... like many of the others, quit messing with your app! It was so much better at counting walking steps or running distance and keeping total steps separate! Smh..."
"Update 8/07/20: I dropped the rating from 5 to 1 because one of the most useful features, Weight Management, was gotten rid of in the recent update. *Original review: A wonderful app that's been helping me get my health back on track."
Great App.! The app coupled with galaxy wearable has played an indespensible role in my fitness journey. Full credits to the developers for the features / options and seamless integration. Thanks!
used to be good but then it suddenly stopped letting me use it saying my phone is rooted. I don't even know what that means and the only fix i can find for it is downloading other things on my phone. which I'm not comfortable with because i don't want to risk a virus. so the app is just useless to me now. I'll be looking for a new health app.
I have been trying to log in to my account since two days and its kept loading and not opening. I have tried with different WiFi. Clear data and cache. Still this error persists. What's wrong happened?
This has LESS sleep features than my 5 y.o. Fitbit. Edit only allows you to DELETE the ENTIRE record. Fitbit allows you to change start and end times. Where is this improved sleep that you marketed? Temp sensor does nothing and watch 5 is no better than watch 4. Plus auto start of workouts STILL NOT WORKING. Step counter completely off -zero. Who puts pedometer under privacy?! I've uninstalled and reinstalled 50 times in the last month to get the phone to connect. Yes cleared cache. Galaxy 20FE
"Not happy with the Aug 5 update. You now require a phone number to join your step challenge? Why?? I'm not passing out my number so I can get more robo calls! And as others have mentioned, the weight management feature is gone! This app is becoming obsolete. Too bad for Samsung..."
"Opened app for the 1st times since it updated. Now MUST have permission to access nearby devices and my phone? No thanks! Samsung continues to be the most data hungry pilfered of personal data I have ever come across. I paid a hell of a lot for this phone and all these basics should come with my personal privacy ensured! Any permissions I give should be my choice not SS's, I will not support SS in future! Deleted all their apps!"
"this app made my gear s watch useless! I Can't use this app because it doesn't login to my Samsung account with ""processing failed"" error. I called the Samsung support team but there wasn't any working workround for my xiaomi phone and as I searched the problem I found out that a lot of people have the same problem!"
It's great. It has free workouts. Keeps track of my vitals. It's available in dark mode. It has a run/walk pacer. It has everything I need in a fitness app. And it's free!!
"I'm not happy with the update, it doesn't track my steps correctly & won't sync with my smartwatch. My phone tells me I've done 7000+ steps today my watch is telling me I've done over double that!!! PLEASE FIX IT!!!!"
"Can you bring back the feature when clicked on ""Together"" that compared your activity level to other Samsung users/ Samsung users your age? And then it would say you're at 61% or top 41% or top 30% etc? It was motivating me to be more active to get to 20% / 30%, but now it's not there anymore after the update. When I click on together now, it's quite empty."
"Tired of the period tracker messing up. If I accidently put in the wrong entry, I can't fix it or remove. Or if I don't click which days my period starts, and i can't go back to fix the day. I have to delete all my date and start over. Yawl need to fix this. Why do I wanna use an app that if I make one mistake, I have to delete all my data and start over. Fix it. I shouldn't have to delete my data. I should be able to add period or delete period. Same with sex. I should be able to edit. Thanks."
"I can't measure stress anymore. It was a great part of the app and the reason I would use it. Now it doesn't measure heat rate from phone, just from the watch."
"I can't even get in to the app, it keeps telling me to set up Two Step Verification which I already have done. Why in the hell would anybody need a two step verification for a fitness app? I swear everytime they update this app it just gets worse. Can't wait till the Iphone 13 comes out this year tired of the bs with your phones"
It is using 100% of my battery and killing my fully charged phone while it is in my pocket in a matter of hours. It wont allow me to uninstall it and it seems to re-enable itself after I have disabled it.
"Was a good app untill they decided to remove key features such as the weight management along with others. I can't call this a health app anymore. Its more like a logbook now, you can log food, steps, sleep and current weight."
"Love Samsung and the app, just wish I could get Samsung Health to connect to Rally. It will not allow me to ""allow permission"" so I have to manually enter things. I have connected through Strava but doesn't catch everything and is frustrating."
My profile and years of tracking history are completely gone with the latest app update. It won't even recognize my email address so I can reset my password. Might as well get another app if I'm going to start from zero
"Re: Samsung What measures have been taken? The top 10 have impossible numbers. Like the 200,000 steps/mo challenges. 3 stars due to impossible step count of leaders. Over 3 million steps per month is not possible. Developers, please filter them out. I like new design on...Just getting use to the change."
"The new permissions are a total turn-off. I have not accepted them so the app is ultimately useless. I too, am not following the explanation for the need. At this point, this app is just taking up space. The update dropped my rating from five to one."
"It doesn't count accurately, missed steps all day long, i do not recommend it."
"I love this app. At the very least it make you conscious about your diet, how much water you drink etc. It also gives you a huge reality check how many calories you put in your body. It also allows you to watch and manage the amount of positive and negative vitamin levels you put in your body. Has helped me change my diet for the better."
"Stopped tracking sleep with my watch. Not sure why it quit doing that, I haven't changed the settings. It was great until now."
"Latest update pretty much ruined whatever was still good about this app. Especially now that it requires you to have a Samsung account to login to simply use the app. Will be deleting. And no, I'm not going to call the 800 number, that is just useless cookie-cutter feedback you're giving to users that are unhappy with the changes."
"The worse program I've ever seen. I tried to open but it wants to open a Samsung Account. I opened an account but also it wants my phone number for send a code. I wrote my phone number true but it can't send an code to my phone number and it locked to send code and I can't open program now. Are you can't installed, don't install anytime!"
"The app is fine but it should be more lively and motivational ! I have a gear sport and the app in the watch needs drastic improvement.It should present stats graphically and should be colourful,not black and white.It should be like Huawei and Asus which have an incredible watch fitness inbuilt app!"
"This is a global pandemic. I downloaded the old app and turned off auto update, it worked for one day. Do the world a favor, turn on the pulse ox. Now. I mean right now. Be a responsible company. Worry about your update later, turn the pulse ox on. Revert to the old app right now. S8 pulse ox not working on stress, not good during covid 19 emergency, fix it now"
"Its a great app for fitness and health. I uninstalled it because I needed some space on my Redmi phone. I wanted to install again, on the same phone after getting the SAMSUNG watch 4 but seems like this app is no longer supported on my mobile device. Is anything changed?"
"This is my primary fitness tracker and i use it in sync with my Galaxy phone and Galaxy active 2. I am office based and i prefer standing at least half of my work day .It does not have a way to detect if i have been sitting or standing and will make a major impact on fitness tracking as its surely different standing 4 hours and sitting 4 hours in an office compared to sitting the whole day, that is 8 hours. Any thoughts?"
This app was perfect as a way of helping me visualize the effects of the food I eat. Now with the weight management tool removed this is just annoying to use. I'm colorblind and every metric is the same damn color i cant tell what the hell anything is anymore.
Tracking is terrible especially sleep. I have the newest watch And the tracking stinks cannot determine start and stop times especially if you begin before and end after midnight.
UPDATED AFTER DEVELOPER RESPONSE: THE RESPONSE IS A NON RESPONSE. I DON'T WANT OR NEED TO GIVE ACCESS TO MY CONTACTS TO ANYONE- REGARDLESS OF HOW THEY PROMISE THEY WON'T USE IT BADLY. I have periodically used the app. i dont want to give it access to my contacts. there is no information i want to share with any of my contacts. there is no contact information i want to share with Samsung. the app no longer works because of my desire for privacy. i wouid erase it but i am not allowed to.
"No notification sounds like if one of my friend sends me a challenge I couldn't know without opening the application,previously it was very good,notification always comes up but not now‚òπplease fix it."
"I had this app on my Samsung s10+ and I used it to track my exercise, food, weight and heart rate. On my s20 fe it doesn't have a heart rate tracker and the weight tracker doesn't automatically show your loss or gain since your last recorded weight."
honestly this app gave me a motivation boost it gave me an activity to do with the day instead of sitting down or just push away my fitness activity. Oh yeah is it okay if you guys make more like accurate foods and drinks from different places because it doesn't give me the one I need. if not then that's okay.
The heart rate monitor is gone along with other features that I used to enjoy. In fact there's nothing useful in this app anymore. The app is now uninstalled.
"Uninstall immediately, you have to give phoje permission, you cannot skip it even if u confirmed to deny, then you have to setup 2FA, you cant skip this literally the worst application i tried to use, huawei is way better"
This app worked perfectly fine and I updated it this morning and now it wants me to log into a Samsung account that I don't have. Why can't it just work without it?
Crashes all the time. Uninstall and reinstall still crashes. Wish there was another app to use for Samsung exercise tracker
I like the app & don't have too many issues but I'm a shift worker so sometimes the app tries to record my sleep & it's wrong & I don't seem to be able to show that I slept during the day.... Can this be changed or added? There are a lot of shift workers in the world.
"Reasonably happy. The step count & distance covered is confusing. I measured a specific distance (6km) on the road, using my car's odometer, but when walking the app shows consistently less distance covered, out by approximately 750 meters.. any reason why?"
This must be the most frustrating app to use on a non Samsung phone. Just got a new Moto phone and it does log me in... The app just keeps spinning. Reset password. Didn't work.deleted and create a new account still didn't work. If I didn't have a Samsung watch I would just give up on this...not worth the hassle... Get a google wear watch instead and save yourself some headaches!!!! What a joke... Now Samsung needs to access our phone!?!
"I LOVE SAMSUNG HEALTH!!!! I've been using Samsung Health for years now and I absolutely love it. I've been using this app on every single Samsung device I've owned and have never ever had any problems or issues with it. Since I've been using it so long when I finally got out from a Samsung Device and went to a 1+7T Pro 5G ""Mclaren Edition"". I had to have this app again, it works flawlessly with the 1+7T Pro, as well as all the Samsung Devices I have (watch, earbuds, etc.)"
"Used to be a very good all-around app. By removing the weight management option it becomes as ""one of the bunch"". Totally disappointing move by Samsung. Please bring back the weight management."
Very bad update including the last 2 versions with 2FA. Never worked with my both numbers one Tunisia and second one KSA. Even trying to skip it application won't work. I was obliged to download an old apk and disable this update.
Used to visit the app daily and found it helped motivate me as with a quick glance you could see all your move and step goals. Since the update it's less user friendly and now just stick to my Polar app as it has everything on one page much like this used to.
"What's the point, this app needs fixing big time, it won't even sync my steps over, I have done over 25,000 steps and syncs zero but has done all my active minutes, this app is the worst fitness app I have used, edit it has started to work I just need to leave it running in the background witch I am fine with"
"As per the developer instructions, I paused the step, forced stop the app and restarted the phone. This helped to resolve the issue at that movement. But next day while travelling in vehicle, I observe the same problem."
Love it! I didnt even know I had the community part to this app. I like the monthly challenges. Also its not ment for you to find love. I have the galaxy watch as well so I like that everything is connected and keeping track of steps and calories burned.
"Decent app, but since last update, it runs continuously in the background killing my battery life. I've done force stops and set it to not run in the background when closed, but this morning I haven't used my phone and in 2 hours it's down to 85% battery due to Samsung Health."
"What possible reason could you have for getting rid of ""weight management"" on a health application????? Updates are supposed to make an application better. Every time I update samsung health, something is omitted in the new version. Whoever is in charge of Samsung health app. has a sick sense of humor. I am gonna try another app."
"I have updated the app and now i can open it, it shows a message ""Access Denied - unauthorized changes were made to your phone. Contact Customer Service for more information."" What's the problem?? Obs: I have never rooted my phone."
Its overall an excellent app with great response from the team and quick and easy solutions. It also helps provide a large number of different and effective workout programs
Frustrating it's frustrating that I can't sync this app with other apps. I want to be able to share my data with other apps. Not very useful if your doing challenges!
"Generally been very satisfied. Have used for just over 1 year now. Within the last month occasionally and seemingly randomly, my 6km of daily walking isn't recorded. Happens aproximately 1 day per week. Very frustrating üòï"
"What's happened? My watch isn't syncing with my steps when phone is remote, even afterwards when it should. It's also not recording my sleep pattern now..not quite so bothered about this,but syncing is a real problem.."
"the app is stuck in the log screen, im not from usa and this is not a Samsung device, its just loading and after half an hour of waiting i gave up, i have samsung watch active and want to store my workout data, is there any other app that can help me, edit: i did all of that and still doesn't work, i cannot dial that number because im not from USA, can i send them mail or something else"
"Can't sign in. I'm just stuck on loading screen after hitting sign in. All other Samsung apps work at signing in but this one. Cleared cache and storage, uninstalled, restarted, etc. Still won't sign in. Currently on Pixel 3a. Latest update is broken."
"cannot override apps sleep record even when you hit RECORD MAUALLY button, fix for better rating, I slept 8hrs it recorded only 3.5. someone suggested this app as an excellent app for its overall tracking for weight loss, Sleep Apnea sleep record and so forth, so far proving very underwhelming."
"They removed the weight management widget, removing the one remaining useful part of the app. Use something else. They seem to randomly remove features. Unreliable app."
"It was a decent app until I bought a new Samsung watch. It hasn't become totally useless but it won't communicate with the Samsung watch to update, defeating the purpose of tracking things to integrate them. Very disappointed in Samsung."
"Just did my 5 km run and hated the new updated version. My run was off, did not do .5 intervals a d my time was not the usual 28 mins. Wasted space The old screen was perfect. Pls revert it back or give us the option"
I love this app. been using it for 2 years or more. but recently it did an update and now I cant even access it. it says my phone is rooted so for my security the app cannot he opened. my phone is NOT rooted. 2 years ++ of running longs gone. pretty disappointed.
"Yeah, I agree with comments regarding Samsung access to friends contacts etc. There is really no need for it, despite your reassurance. Remove this feature, or I will remove the app and find some other fitness app to use."
"Won't open/work on brand new pixel 6 pro! Trying to switch my galaxy watch3 from my pixel 5 to 6.. watch migrated and restored but Samsung health will not. U installed reinstalled a dozen times.. BROKEN, please fix I use this all the time.. I get error notice everytime.. notice is Samsung account session expired (0x2B#128) happens everytime I try to log in..."
"Why does a health app require my phonecall access and two point verification? After and update, it stopped working completely, than i uninstalled and reinstalled it, and now it wants my call data and phone number, for an app i use to track my weight in the morning, locally, on my phone. Pooking for alternatives now."
"S2 classic battery drain. This app is wrecking my watch battery life. I used to get a few days in power saving mode. I am lucky if I get 5 hours now, since this damn app is always running and, their is no way to uninstall it or disable it on my watch."
"Good application but unfortunately it doesn't work for my samsung 5 watch presumably because it doesn't work in my current location (Bahrain), so I couldn't make use of ECG or BP measurements. However, it's been working nicely for other family members and friends."
"I like most features of the app, how easy everything is to track and for those who menstrate there is a tracker built in. The one thing I don't like about the app is how hard it is to compare calories in to calories out everyday. I can just see calories burned though activity not the estimated burned though BMR as well"
"I have ""phone"" permission (access) enabled, but I DO NOT want you to have access to my CONTACTS. I NEVER had to grant CONTACT access to use ""together"" for WORLD Challenges. I DO NOT care about where my contacts are on the leader board. I DO NOT want to challenge them either. Please DO NOT tell me Samsung need access to my CONTACTS because for years you did not and I could participate in the WORLD challenges with no issues!!!"
"Worked great until Privacy notice. Now I hit accept and it keeps telling must be accepted in settings. Been thru settings multiple times, NO WHERE DOES IT SAY ACCEPT PRIVACY TERMS. Very frustrating. App worked great, now pretty worthless."
Not happy with latest update. Used to let me use app without creating a specific Samsung account. Now can't access my health data without creating one. I shouldn't have to. Hoping next update will fix this issue? UPDATE: Newest update still hasn't fixed this issue
"I used to use this app daily on my s6. Now I upgraded to an s10 and the app says it can't take readings anymore and that i have to take O2, pulse and stress readings elsewhere and only log them into this app?!? What is going on? Please fix! Every other app I've tried is stupid and burns my finger with the camera flash bulb to attempt a reading. Would've been 5 stars if it still worked!!!"
"Yes! You do what i want, thank you. I give ypu 5 star! (Before) Please open access to rooted device. What if people buy a secondhand device that previously rooted. Its not our fault for the rooted device, we need this feature (health). Do something real, not just getting us to contact a samsung customer service. Thank you"
Almost perfect! So complete and configurable. Miss macro targeting (not just the default percentage) and recipes (not food) creation; then you have the best fitness track app!
"Had to uninstall this. It fights for priority of the NFC scanner when trying to use NFC labels or hardware like LibreLink for diabetics like myself. No way to just turn off the NFC part of this app, or set a default for NFC use (thanks Samsung) so I have to get rid of this and find a new health monitor."
Worked perfectly up until the last update now my watch doesn't record exercise when selected from the watch. Fed up with companies that keep screwing my hardware with software uodates!!!!!!! So I have to ring the US to sort a problem you created. How about a refund and compensation for making my hardware not fir for purpose!
"it has some mistakes. For instance, this app doesn't manage to measure stress specific. Heart rate is not sufficient reason to measure stress levels. Maybe someone was exercised. However, that is the best app for health. I suggest this app."
"The app ok given the restrictions of phone screen sizes, but when will Samsung Health be upgraded with a web interface so that we can see all our data on a decent size screen? That would make really useful rather than just a gimmick."
"Has been a good app. But in their latest ver inst. 7/30, the home screen widget only comes in a 1x5 size... And the data only occupies about half that space. Somebody wasn't thinking."
"I use to love this app. But now for whatever's reason it just stopped working right. For the last 3 weeks or so the steps on my watch are not crossing over to this app. I've reset, deleted and re download. Everything. I went from 6000-1100 Steps a day to like 1000-3000. So annoyed"
"Really Really Rubbish. Doesn't count steps. Doesn't register auto exercises when I'm walking. Doesn't show heart rate or VO2 max, doesn't even show sweat loss, how much more snuggly does someone have to wear this watch 4. I work out a lot and this watch isn't worth the massive amount of money I paid for it."
Very helpful app and keeps you motivated. I would like to see an option to increase the number of inviduals in the Friends leaderboard chart. Currently it displays five max.
Why does a fitness tracker insist that it manages calls? Stop demanding permissions that have nothing to do with the point of the app. Previous versions did not refuse to run without the unnecessary permissions. Documentation stated that it is optional to boot. Booo!
"The app told me I was walking 3 miles & I was so happy. I thought that was long for me & I decided to check the accuracy by walking my local park. One trip around the park was 1 mile! I started the app & began to walk to see if the mileage was correct! I used the same distance I was using,(3 miles) but it told me I completed one mile & I was only ¬æ of a mile completed! I was really walking about 2.25 miles!!! I thought it would be more accurate using GPS! I can see steps being off but not GPS!ü§î"
"A very fun way to motivate you to add just those few extra steps every day. Achievable goals along the way, and a pace setter that is realistic make it fun."
Downloaded this on my Huawei mate 20 Pro as I got the Active2 watch. Haven't been able to open the app since I downloaded. Contacted customer services via the email from the app store to be told contact through app. Good one Samsung I can't access the app. Waste of money buying the watch I am from the UK and not able to call this number provided. When will there be an update
This app this such a disappointment since the update. I used it to monitor my stress levels and my oxygen levels. They took it away. It was what indicated that my daughter was having breathing issues when she couldn't explain it to us.
same problem with can't open app on rooted phone yet my phone isn't rooted. only way to solve it from reopening over and over was to uninstall the app. id like to reinstall and use it but it seems with a lengthy amount of time they've yet to fix it.... very annoying
"S10. Heart rate sensor no longer works? I've only heard the worst about reinstalling. I need to use the app to help get a general grasp on my heart activity as I am a fall risk. I know it isn't a medical replacement, but it at least let me know when I needed medical attention"
The pace tracker on audio support is completely wrong. At the end I can read the reports is showing correct. While running it says over 6.0 after I can read the average pace of less than 5.3...
The last update has ruined the sleep tracking graphs. It is just wavy lines now instead of the stacks that were easy to read. Very disappointed. This is the reason I usually refuse updates. Why do you take away what is working and replace with something so useless.
"As soon as I updated my Android phone to Oreo (8) the app no longer connects with MyFitness Pal or pull any data. I've already restarted both apps and my phone, nothing works!!! Fix this!!! Update: still not working on the Samsung S20 FE smh"
"With the recent update, my Samsung Health will not sync my steps with myfitnesspal. I've Uninstalled and reinstalled both apps to no avail. According to blogs, it's been an arising issue since August 2019 with no fix from Samsung Health and myfitnesspal. My galaxy watch is basically useless."
I like the app it works perfect for me but whenever I swotch from Maximum power saving mode to again normal mode the app don't show correct distance and speed like of I ran for 3km it will only 1.74km so every time i need uninstall and install it back to fix it.
"Auto detect workouts doesn't map routes, just gives a general blue circle. Have to select an activity to have the route mapped. Very inconvenient to stop and select activity."
App challenges are basic. 2 months in a row that the challenge is 200k steps. Activity heart goals per day should not include a workout each day but rather an activity minutes per day. This helps build a healthy mental state with exercise. If people think they need to exercise for half an hour plus each day they'll soon come to resent exercise due to exhaustion.
"I love using this app.. Its very to track our workout.. Am using this app since 2 years and it serving good with latest updates.. One thing i want to suggest please add cycling data recorder as well.. Like it has walking detection alerts, similar to that app should have cycling detection feature or atleast cycling data record feature.. Please take it as a serious advice because tons of people who ise this app might have been doing cycling on a daily basis for health and fitness so please add this feature to it so that app gets completed, no one has to download another app for cycling record.. Just my 2 cent.."
"It was really good until the latest update, because now the features caffeine and weight management are gone. Weight management was the app's best tool and now I don't see a reason to use the app. Bring it back Samsung!"
"New update won't let me open the app without allowing phone call permissions, which are not actually a required permission as per product details. The only way to contact the developer is through the app, which I can't do because it won't open until I allow the permissions which are not required."
It is okay but it says it links to underarmer myfitpal but food isn't transfering and exercise only if I save it. I don't want to have to log food twice and the logging food is much better in myfitpal. Tried but customer service is horrible and don't get a helpful answer. Also today information on auto log was wrong and even thought it logged I walked over 8000 steps says none where health . System sure has issues
I deleted the app after enjoying this for a couple of years. The new privacy agreement is extremely invasive. Why does a step tracker need to have access for phone calls? Why do I need to college a 2 step security verification to see if I win a stupid badge each month? Y'all are up to something shady. I'll keep my privacy thank you.
Weight management was removed!!! Useless Now!!! Loved the app but now Samsung removed the weight management and was the only thing good about their watch combo. I've been loyal to Samsung but honestly this is pushing me to iPhone in future. Don't waste your time downloading and just get a paid app.
I like that it will automatically monitor walking without having to start the exercise mode. Seems to be a bit buggy monitoring sleep. Like the community challenges and tracking.
Doesn't keep accurate step count - either shows less or none. Example: yesterday I had over 5000 and it showed less; today it shows none. This is a recurring issue and I'm sick & tired of it doing this. I WILL NOT BE USING THIS APP ANYMORE!!!
"with the new update, it requires me to give certain permissions. App deleted. I dont want to give u certain permissions, creepy app. Thank you for the explaination, yet I still believe you can do it without all these permissions. Maybe just learn to respect people's privacy, before everybody dig their apple or samsung phones."
"I hate this new update!!! What happens to the area that let me see if I was under, good, or over my calories? I relied on that to monitor my intake each day. Why have you taken so many good features away. We need to go back to the way everything was before this last update. I loved this app so much before this update."
"Announcement that Samsung Health is phasing out weight tracking, caffeine tracking and other features. WHY ARE YOU DESTROYING THIS APP? Samsung Health was a goto for all things health related, now you have decided to delete feature after feature. Many thanks for supporting your customer base.....not ...and it keeps getting worse. New devices do not have HR sensor making HR, O2 level and stress impossible to measure without BUYING ANOTHER DEVICE. Plus the food tracker search engine is now NOT searching the database after one picks the first food. All in all, a waste of space on my Note 10"
Need access to my camera and control over my phone??????? NO THANKS. Used this app for several years. I would rather use a excel spreadsheet. PRIVACY MATTERS !! If this is Samsung's approach to Privacy I may have to re-think MY CHOICE of mobile device in the future. UNISTALLED
"The app used to work perfectly but now I can't launch it even after updating it. I can't open it anymore. I thought it needs to be updated so I downloaded the update, yet, it didn't open. I downloaded the update again and still it didn't open. Help me solve this issue."
Don't understand why Samsung seems to continually remove more and more functionality from this app. Thousands of users complaining about the same issue- the removal of weight management/calorie tracking met with the same generic response. Will not be purchasing another smart watch through Samsung had removed all the features that made it unique.
I love how easy it it to use this app and how convenient everything is placed. I love how I can always go back and see all the progress that I've done. Overall this is a great app to use for anyone who wants to have a little bit of fun and keep all of it back up for motivation. You can join challenges for free to help you push yourself to be the best you! I highly recommend this app and already have had some friends and family to use it more. Keep up the good work Samsung Health team! üëè
"I love the Samsung health app! It's user friendly. It keeps track of everything that is important to me. It keeps track of steps, time, exercise and calories. I walk 5 miles a day so it's very convenient for me, I don't have to do anything! I would highly recommend the Samsung health app to anyone who is trying to stay healthy no matter what form of exercise you do!"
"Can't find the Stress Monitor. I just bought the new Galaxy Watch Active, and still doesn't show up neither in the phone nor the watch.  EDIT: I just found out that the Stress Monitor is not available in Canada, which is kind of silly."
"For the past 3 + months when I go to check some items it states No response from service try again later"" several updates later still not fixed, unistalled,, reinstalled, cleared cache, approved all permissions, you name it, not fixed, even called support, still not fixed, fix this and it'll be a 5 star review, because I enjoy what does work. Joh"
Great app for holding yourself accountable. Easy to set up challenges and participate in a worldwide challenge. I use it everyday! It's more motivational than a regular pedometer.
best app I've used and it came with my phone. love the syncing with watch and tracking of cycling stats. so motivating. bad weather days give me bedside options for workouts in the added programs section.
suddenly won't open as says my phone is rooted which it isn't. I don't even know how to root my phone. now all the data I put in to track my diet/weight loss and fitness progress is lost. thanks
"Still cannot be used without a samsung account, like before version 6.15, I don't have any problem using the app without transfer and backup data, even I prefer it that way, and you removed the choice leaving app useless. Edit: Since the force sign in policy I downgrade the app to 6.12 to use it without a samsung account, sorry but that ""sign up or deny"" policy make me realize that I don't wanna purchase another samsung wear ever"
"Got a new phone and went to install it again, trying to set up the two factor authentication and I can't get past the verify code part. I get the code I enter the code but it won't allow me to verify. I've tried dozens of times. Deff not happy with this anymore."
"By mistake I unistalled the app and now I am trying to sign in to my account its only showing loading but not completing. *Edit-Even tried creating another acount even though all my stats would be gone. The same, only loading. And I am sure that is not a problem of my device. *Edit-Happening since many days."
used to be really easy to use and could track and record everything. Now I can't change my weight goals as even turning off weight management doesn't work.
"My husband just purchased a Samsung Galaxy Active watch. He wasn't able to pair it with his tablet, so he paired with my old LG V20 phone. This phone has no Sim card. When the app was opened, it said he needed a sim card to use it. No other app downloaded to this phone ever required a sim card. Why does this app need a sim card?"
The only thing I don't use this app for is tracking food. There's no barcode scanner and recipes are impossible to build and track properly. If this was fixed it would be the only health app I use. Until then I'll be using loseit.
Unable to edit or delete items added (make sure you don't make a mistake!!!) And nowhere to type in values. If a pre written portion is 85g and you need to add 200g you have to continually swipe increasing the risk of RSI and flaring up of RSI if you already have it. Also would like the option to plan meals ahead.
"It gives me daily targets that I am now able to achieve and even surpass. It is interactive, and I enjoy the owl messages. The only disadvantage is when I do not have internet connectivity I am not motivated to session, because it feels like wasted when my work out cannot be recorded."
"Every time a new 'version or update is made, the step counter doesnt count all steps, which is annoying, as you cannot edit them. Luckyly got no a Pedometer for accurate step count and this app for cal and weight control."
Well integrated into the Samsung ecosystem. Accurate GPS mapping when cycling. Auto detection of workouts is helpful as well. Nice to be able to measure pulse and record BP.
"There's something wrong with how the app calculates steps. Just a week ago I was almost at 100k steps for the month, now I'm back to 30k. It baffles me coz I'm automatically losing challenges I have with friends and I sure am losing excitement in how the app motivated my active lifestyle. üòî"
It is awfull now..after update it want permissions and if i give permission and try the verification it keeps saying invalide code even though i have been entering the right one. Even the ones it got itself from the text message it even keeps saying invalid to those. HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED
"Worst tracking app, I traveled in Bus for 4hrs of journey. I haven't stepped more then 100. But it's calculated around 5500 steps for 4hrs bus journey. When it's comes to watch while I'm riding bike it's always start bicycle ride. This issue I'm facing since galaxy watch released date to till now. Really I'm wondering why samung not fixed this issues??"
The reason I am giving a 1 star is I loved this app on my S8 but just purchased a new S20FE 5G and this app is useless. Why did you take off the heart rate and oxygen measure. I used them a couple times a day. I have very low heart rate and the old app left me know where my heart rate was and it was accurate. I checked it many times with my blood pressure machine. I hope you put these both back on this app.
"Since the update the food choices have disappeared so no longer searches for anything when typed in, now have to Google items first then add it to the ""my food"" section. That's a huge pain. Just installed it for my mum and hers is the same with nothing coming up on the food search. Loved the App before, it's just ok now"
"I was using an older version it was perfect, I just updated and now it is asking permission to manage my phone calls, seriously!!!!!! Samsung what the heck is this and on top of that it is asking to setup 2FA, I dont want so much of security and I dont want to handover my phone management to Samsung. I wish there is a way to downgrade to older version please help!!!"
"App updated and can no longer be used without granting permission to phone, contacts, microphone, and camera. That's sketchy. Update: Samsung's response fails to mention the class action lawsuit they're facing for data abuse, and the accusations of paying for fake reviews on their apps."
"Great app and easy to use. Only complaint from me is that I can't export swim lap data or edit glitches when my watch sends bogus lap info. Overall, though, I love it."
"worst health app amongst others like Apple or Xiaomi or u name it,and after repeated complaints,their soln""pls restart the app, pls click sync"" Doesn't sync,only shows the data of the time when u log in the app,like it didn't show any data of the past few days.tried uninstalling n reinstalling, reset etc.n anyway syncing of data with samsung health app takes long to update the data,.they should learn from Apple or even Xiaomi which did a brilliant job in health app..."
"Hi Samsung, Before your last update, i use your SHealth app to record my speed in my Philam Vitality app. After your last update, the Philam Vitality app does not record the speed from SHealth anymore. This is on Shealth because this happened in two of my Samsung cellphones. Can you assist me or can you get back to the old version where you generate speed data for other apps like Philam Vitality? Btw, i am not from US so if you can provide an email to contact that would be better. Thanks."
"App is amazing and really accurate.helps me in many ways an makes me walk more an strive harder when I see I'm closer to a goal.thank you Samsung for this app I've been using for several years.like the new updates too.i walked over 4500 miles with all 3 of my accounts though out the years.the only thing I didn't like was it made it super hard for to recover them accounts once I got another phone due to being lost,stolen,beyond repair,etc.happened twice already and this my 3rd account."
Samsung- please consider revisiting the calorie burned calculation system for the exercise modes. It is simply not good enough to have a set calorie rate based on the nominated activity disregarding the heart rate zones. It renders the samsung watches inaccurate and unfit for purpose. I've had mine for 2 weeks and I am already looking at swapping to a garmin. I was astonished to see how many negative comments there are regarding this- please consider your product users feedback. Thanks
absolutely hate the new update I have a lung condition and used the pulse oximeter on my phone religiously to track my oxygen levels over time. now is gone all my data is gone and the way it is taken now is useless for checking averages. I am highly disappointed in this update I hope you reconsider the change. this was the main reason I stayed with Samsung and did not change to the iPhone like everyone else at my company.
"Account? I've had this app for three years and its been easy to use for what I wanted it for. With the new update it asks me to sign into my Samsung account, which I've never had so now it just only shows me the steps I've taken. I can no longer use the bicycle or running part of the app."
Nowhere near as good as the Garmin health app. I cant believe that Samsung would do such a poor job of presenting the tracked health data. ECG has bee approves in Canada but it is still not available in the app or watch. I see that Samsung tells everyone to call Samsung suppprt. Why? I see a years worth of complaints and you have not solved any of them. So very disappointing.
Absolutely garbage app. I had it on my old phone and it worked fine with my Samsung Galaxy watch. Since I upgraded my phone it won't let me change Samsung accounts. I've spent an hour on the phone with their help department and have received no help. Don't buy Samsung
I had this on my phone for so long and just a few months ago I decided to explore this app and did not regret it it is so amazing.The one thing I would like to say and hope they add on is on exercise it does have jumping on a trampoline so that is the only thing I did not like but other than that definitely recommend.
I have no control over entering my own weight lifting stats and can't restart the timer if it pauses itself. I need more control over my data. This app is becoming useless.
Great app. One suggestion to make it better is to be able to modify the hours your day in the app starts. I work a rotating shift and my day starts at 12 noon and ends at 3 a.m. the next day. Not being able to modify the hours makes my meals scattered throughout both days
I wish there was an intermittent fasting countdown & tracker within the app. PLEASE add that. Bonus points if it helps estimate calories burned during fat buring times. I would pay for this feature!!!
"This app had a weight management feature. It also counted steps. Even with the new changes, removing these are a loss. Shame they don't survey users before they take things away."
"Please fix the new version of the app. It does not accept new sign ins via the Samsung Health app (the wear app signs in no problems). Like other people here it just spins, and clearing storage and cache and rebooting are not fixes, it is broken. 2 x very annoyed Samsung watch users in this house!"
Can't understand how can Samsung justify showing ads in the application required to fully utilise paid for hardware. I was on the market for a new watch and that was the final straw which pushed me away from having another Samsung Wearable. What's next? Ads on the watchface every few minutes? I'm out.
"Samsung weekly, monthly Average for blood pressure please. I have to go through the entire month going through each day just to come up with a weekly an monthly average. W and M needs to be an option. Having a calendar inside the blood pressure tab stating it's statistics would be helpful. Apple has it."
Only having the option of text for two factor authentication is terrible. I do not currently have cell service only internet therefore there is no way for me to access the application. Should have option for email or voice.
"Had to uninstall all updates after the latest one to get back to what it was before. It was a great app with elegant design. Why mess with it? Even the widget got ugly. I loved it being transparent. What is the saying? ""If it ain't broken, don't fix it"". And I dont appreciate being forced to create an account."
"Like the other comments below, I have used this app for quite a while now and really liked it, but was also disappointed to find out that if I wished to continue using it I would have to agree to a host of new permissions. For example, I cannot see how access to my camera will improve this app. Perhaps this could be explained? As things stand I will no longer be using this. Its a shame really."
"App does not work properly at all ,does not detect my steps please fix this issue !!"
"The app was the best until the last update 8/5. It took off ""weight management""n feature"" with your calories intake and burning to know if you were under, good or over your goal. I had lost 20 pounds please put it back!"
Sleep data is being recorded wrong and breaks data into 2 parts for the same night - before midnight and after. It is nonsense and seems Samsung was not able to fix it for several years!
Something has gone very wrong with this App as from a week ago. Go round in circles with Settings and Permissions. Tried uninstall and reinstall but makes no difference.
"Overall 4.5 stars, always room for improvement, as I've gotten my watch it has been been my best training and tracking buddy.üéâüòçLove the GPS recording with an 100% accuracy and the combination of fitness palüëåüèΩüëçüèΩ Also would be really cool in the step analysis if it's saying you're in the top 15, of all users, to add how many are there in total to be compared to? ü§î Couldn't find an updated number, except an entry on Google from 2017 üòâJust out of curiosity for my own sake. ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
"Wont let me open the app. It states my phone is rooted and it fails to start. My phone is stock and not rooted. update: called Samsung for help. the fix was temporary, back to saying my phone is rooted. I am going to hold off on buying a gear watch since I am having so much trouble with the app."
The auto Sleep records on new app are quite inaccurate compared to the order version.
"I love this app. My only issue is, when calculating my daily intake, the app automatically assumes I add salt to everything and it shows my sodium intake is crazy high. I cook with very little salt because there are dietary restrictions in my household. I would appreciate being able to record the sodium for each meal manually sans what is naturally in the food. (Eg. 70 mg sodium in one large egg but the app records cooked eggs at 171) With no salt added the cooked egg still only contains 70 mg."
"Sadly, this is definitely the most inaccurate digital pedometer I've found so far, so even though some of the other aspects are not bad, the app overall isn't good enough."
I stillcant get this app to link properly to Myfitness pal to track steps. Its really frusterating. Myfitness pal syncs into Samsung health no problem but not the other way around and I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling the both apps a couple times as well as scouring the interwebs to find a fix. Please FIX THIS
"Have used this for a few years now and liked it, but what happened to the heart rate and pulse ox measurements?? I used those A LOT. Are they not compatible with my device? I just upgraded to the Galaxy S21 basic model. Severely disappointed to lose those features."
"Could not remove icon at top of screen so it was installed. Looking for a better app. If i can't find one that works with my Samsung watch, maybe it's time to say goodbye to Samsung after all these years."
"I used to like this app a lot, but wasn't able to use it since the two step verification was introduced. A random phone number pops up and when I try to use a different/my number I get the code, enter it and nothing happens. Therefore, the app is useless to me."
"Update: we recently started using the Nike Running App instead. We are training for a marathon so it would help if we could challenge each other by how many miles we've run. Also he is 6""3 and I'm 5""3 so I naturally take more steps than he does so it implies I'm doing more even though he is outside running and I'm in the house walking around. Please please create a way to track/compete with miles AND SYNC WITH NIKE RUN APP on the Active Watch!"
"The Active 2 watch is great, battery sucks so bad! It always dies so fast. I am not impressed with the samsung health app, it looks so outdated. upgrade n change the format. Please check out Garmin app and make Samsung's better. Common guys!"
"Love the app, wish I could edit target for workouts so when i select with my watch it does the sets that i want. Doesn't always track awake, light, and deep sleep. Not sure why. Using app is improving my health, thanks samsung."
"Good in theory but fails to work correctly in synching. No data is collected so even after any activity nothing is recorded from 3rd party connections like Strava. after 10km run for example, app still shows no steps"
what 'improved' or 'optimized' experience are you providing by needing phone access? pretty sure its not something magical or even necessary so this feature should be OPTIONAL. it does NOT matter if you aren't storing any info. too many apps and services have data breaches and hacks and outright lie and try to trick their users. give your users ownership & power over the very expensive device they bought or lose customers.
Was great. What happened? Having similar problems as others. Can't agree to new privacy notice without giving access to just about everything on the phone; not happening. What gives? Not sure what this app does now since I can't open it. Any help appreciated.
Edit: are these issues being fixed or should I find a new app? Original review August 2020: The weight management feature is gone? This is very frustrating as I used this feature the most. Please bring it back!
really wish they could add a barcode scanner to where you add your food cause it's really hard to find some of the food like some of the calorie counter food apps have it then you just scan the barcode of what your eating then it gives all the nutritional facts and calories and the serving portion your sapouse to eat cause at the moment iam using this app to track fitness and another to track calorie intake
"I like it shows the amount of miles walked, steps and burned calories, but I haven't been able to see the route. Before the update I used to see it on my phone. It was like a little map."
"I have to continually turn off the daily news briefing and good sleeping tips on my Gear S3 Frontier..... when I turn them off, they should stay turned off until I turn them back on. Every few days, I am having to turn it off. I'm a night shift worker and this is getting very annoying"
"I like using this app to watch my activity level and step count and the challenges give me that extra push. It would be nice to add Resistance training and weight training (‚óèbarbell hip thrusts, dead lifts, kattlebell swings and squats etc‚óè) to the list of activities so I could add my training sessions. That's why it's 4 stars."
"I just tried to use the Samsung health and it says that the privacy notice has been updated but now it won't let me agree to it and it says that i need to allow it in setting but when I go to settings, it says that I already have it allowed. This sucks because I've used Samsung health for a long time"
Battery drain is insane. Also it's quite terrible at syncing details immediately. Sometimes needs the phone to be restarted for the results to show up.
I try to log in to the app and it starts spinning but never opens. After waiting I finally get a notification that I need to agree to the policies. I click and then spinning begins again.
"Long time user but very disappointed in the new update, I should not have to give permission for my phone data!!!! If this does not change I will uninstall it. Your answer is not good enough, If you don't use the information then why do you want it....? It worked fine before! I will be now deleting the app."
A very invasive app. Demands access to your contacts otherwise no access to the app. I will be deleting and looking for an app. I don't want your copy paste message saying call the number.
"Last Friday I was applauding you for fixing step length and distance calculation... I was WRONG!!! In reality, on Friday everything was correct: (Walk without GPS) I walked 7454 steps, 5.22 km, what is giving step length 69 cm (almost perfect... My steps length are 68 cm). Today I walked 6287 steps, 5.0 km whats yield steps length 79 cm. Do you know what its mean? You have to be almost 2 m tall to have steps this length (190 cm, 6'4'' for Americans) or have 'leg up to neck' (person high x 0.415 = steps length). I'm not bamboo and did not grow 30 cm over night!. How's come that there was no software update and this calculation changes so dramatically? How you did you do this? Are you pushing software changes without user knowledge? * Galaxy S9"
Would be fabulous if it had a bar scanner. Also find it fairly difficult to add options after you have entered initial data. I use My Fitness Pal and Samsung health... I now have a Samsung smart watch(beautiful) so am pairing them up.
"Why we can't change the distance after finishing the treadmill workout??? It's so simple! Not a difficult functional change!! The distance measured by active 2 is wrong!!! Please, insert the function to calibrate distance directly on watch after finish the treadmill workout! Like Garmin, Amazfit, Suunto, Polar etc etc"
"Switched to Garmin where cheating is taken seriously; too many people with over 2 million steps a month. The app itself is good, but allows for pointless cheating and inaccurate data. I can at least say that this app was a good start to my journey of fitness and health."
This app was great until you updated it. Why do developers do that all the time? You took a GREAT app and ruined it. The numbers are also WAY too small on the widget now. How can I go back to the good version? And please stop updating something that doesn't need fixed! I've been using this app since 2015 and now I hate it. I guess I'll have to buy a fitbit. At least I won't have to worry about bored developers ruining it.
"Doesn't sync sleep with Galaxy Active Watch2. On the watch is recorded, but not on Health app. Everything else works fine, steps, HR, etc. I've reset both watch and app, but no fix."
"Using this app on my gear S3 classic and Google Pixel 2XL with Android 10.0. So far so good. The only downside is Samsung needs to increase the hard drive space on their watches. 32GB space please on future watches. I'd hate to switch to the Garmin Fenix, bit I'm willing to give up the bells and whistles for a watch that handle hours in the water and with a tougher glass/bezel that won't crack or scratch easily."
"*** UPDATE 2 *** The app was updated today and seems to provide higher SpO2 readings now. Still leaving the 5th star off for the food log. *** UPDATE *** In response to the developers reply below, I cleared the cache and it does not appear to have any effect on the readings. **************** My pulse oximeter sensor is giving bad readings. Typically gives readings in low 90's when my doctor's sensor gives 98+. Also disappointed in the cumbersome and incomplete food log database it ties to."
It was great till the last update when they removed the weight management. Without this feature it is useless. Hope they return it again as soon as possible.
"There's no reason I should be forced to set a phone pin of password to use this app. I'm a single father with a 4 year old. If something happens to me she needs to use my phone. Not going to complicate things for her with a stupid password on my phone just so I can use this app. Remove that useless feature please or at least allow people to not use that feature. What is the point anyway? Oh no, I lost my phone now some random person is going to know my super important ekg readings."
I really enjoy using this app. I'm not sure how accurate the step counter is but I enjoy competing with my mom and my brother every month to see who reaches out to sea. My mom usually had us and this is the 1st month I've reached out. Easy to use and reminds me to keep active. Been using this for quite a few years
So I used to love this HR tracker and stress levels etc. I could tell that it was pretty accurate according to how I was feeling that time. Now after the update my HR at any time shows me v low and stress levels also show v low all the time. And when I check the same HR on my fitbit it shows higher than Samsung's. I'm assuming there is a problem with your new tracker .. anybody else face this problem?
The latest update requires too many permissions including access to phone calls. I can't see why this is necessary. I have used the app happily until now. If you don't approve additional access in settings the app can't be opened
Used to be a great app but oc updates ruined it.. For what reason do you NEED to have permission to make and manage calls for this app to work?? I don't want to hear about the watch bc I don't use one and I don't want to hear about the better overall exp. Either bc it serves zero purpose to me for you to have all these permissions. Will find a different fitness app to use now thanks.
Extremely disappointed that SpO2 has been removed without warning and with it all of my trend history! Samsung stop making lame excuses that it can be measured along with the stress thingie. Lots of us genuinely relied on this as a separate item for our health needs. Wish I could give zero stars!!
"The heart, stress & oxygen readings are not accurate. Updated April 20, 2021 Why does Samsung Health need permission to manage and make phone calls. By denying this permission, the app will not work. Why do you want permission to monitor and make phone calls? If this is not against privacy, I don't know what is. Ridiculous! Uninstalling this useless app."
Using that app on an s9+ with a galaxy watch. As a former iphone/apple watch user; It definitely needs an update and could be so much more. It works for the most part but meh. Also why no period tracker.
"I've used this app for years, suddenly I'm unable to use it because it wants to access phone calls? I think this is a step too far! I don't see why this kind of app needs to have this permission at all! I think this is an invasion of privacy and completely unnecessary. Permenantly remove this requirement, or I'll permenantly remove this app! I find this such a shame, as it was such a good and reliable app until this issue."
"This app used to work great. Recently it stopped counting my steps and recording activity. Neither my gear or the phone. Yesterday it recorded 400 steps from a full active day. I've tried uninstalling, updating both the gear and my phone :/"
"Samsung Health is a sick puppy. Tracking of workouts between watch and phone is disfunctional. Finish exercise on phone, it continues on watch. Start exercise on watch, and after the set the watch never started. If you are a serious weight lifter or gym person look elsewhere. Very disappointing."
"I use this app to measure my steps and time on the treadmill. Unfortunately I can not trust its calorie count, though. It over counts them by at least twice the amount. That's based on several treadmills I have used. If this app says 500 calories, I know it is really less than 250 in reality."
I really love my samsung health since it works with my samsung fitness watch. I do have a major problem. I live a ketogenic lifestyle and there is no way to adjust the Macros. so it always says I'm not eating enough carbs but I can't! I'd change my rating to 5 stars if I could adjust my intake percentages!
Pretty good but the excersise input needs help. I do the same thing nearly every day but there is no way to copy from yesterday and the defaults do not learn. So I have to input manually and that is cumbersome.
Update is TRASH. Stuck on the 2 step verification. Makes the app unusable!!!! Edit: @samsung I'm not an idiot. I followed the prompts and it never let's me get past the 2nd step.. hence why I stated that the app is STUCK ON THE 2 STEP VERIFICATION. Makes this app worthless & I'll be uninstalling.
"Different voice coach options would be great for exercises. Such as picking drill instructor style to voice over progress, or other sound options. Great app."
"Good app, but many missing essentials. Auto-fill calorie disappeared with last update. Instead it could become more functional. No Skiing choice in workout on Gear watch app."
Was working well till 2 days before. Now it stopped counting my daily steps. Have to clear cache and force stop in the application manager to make it work again. And the next morning it stops working again and have to do the same to make it work again.
not enough editable features such a macronutrients. Not everyone has the same goals just based on weight and height. Needs to be more friendly towards specific goals and meal plans
"This app has been great. It has helped me lose 50 pounds. The tool that helped me lose weight was the weight management tab but after the recent update, the tab is no longer there. What happened to the weight management feature?"
"To get this app to actually sync with my gear S3 I have to uninstall and reinstall it daily. i contacted customer support and they just told me to do a bunch of basic things I already did, which I had stated. Honestly I can't wait to get Samsung out of my life."
"Just bought a sumsung S21 upgrade from S8 but can not update stress, heart rate like It did on the S8 mmmm May be me. Overall I have been using it for ages and it is the best app. Now my weekly activity does not display each week!! Still can not see stress heat beat like I use to bloody head shaker should of stayed with my S8 groan"
"Good app, great health tips, fun challenges. Only downside is sometimes the steps will count when I am riding the train (so not accurate when on a train). Other than that I really enjoy this app."
The update has rendered this app the step counter on my Samsung active watch completely useless my partner hasn't updated his and we walked same distance mine says 4465 my partners say over 10000 we have exactly same phones and exactly same watch. With regards to your reply cant pause and restart spent hours going throught everything on the app. Im uk based so that telephone number is useless. Im close to just packing it in i know full well I do more steps then the phone and watch are saying
Not able to link with google fit or other fitness smart watch apps. Not compatable with Google fit app
"Verbal cues telling distance at half mile is malfunctioning, for about last two weeks or more. It says 0 miles at 0.5 Today it said i had completed mile at about ¬æ. Please investigate and correct. Thank you"
Excellent app let down by step counter working intermittently on my A50. Have to clean the phone memory and clear the app cache every day. The monthly challenges are helpful and the background statistics from worldwide are interesting.
"I loved this app but I can no longer use the features after the update, cant do stress test or ur heart rate nothing works, I can't even put what I ate or drank, only keeps of with steps I've taken, which is nice but while dieting and walking to get in shape I really enjoyed all these features , why make the app if u delete all the good stuff in a update. Please bring back older version and I will give a5 star"
"The app was perfect until update. I've been using the app for years and years. After last weeks update, the app us destroyed. It's not working, not even is I want to add my information manually. It's very sad. I'm so disappointed."
Received your reply. followed instructions. app received same error. After last update app won't even open. says can't be used on a rooted phone. submitted info but have never heard back. really disappointed because I used it all the time!!
"this app worked fine prior to one of the most recent system updates, now it wont even open because it said my phone was rooted, which it absolutely has not been. I updated it and now it's saying someone made unauthorized changes to my phone. no, again Samsung. you're giving me too much credit in the 'risking to brick my phone' department"
"I cant even log in now since the upgrade. I have to use the two step login and when I receive the verification code via text and input into the app nothing happens, I am stuck on the login screen."
I loved this app before the last update: it gave your total miles walked for the week and now it only gives you your daily average miles walked per day. I'm more motivated when I can see the entire week's miles walked. I still use it everyday though.
"Works great with my phone.... My Samsung Galaxy Watch talks with my Samsung phone, but doesnt connect to my Samsung tablet. Strangly my tablet was purchased 6 months after my phone and the OS is up to date... It would be nice to have my watch connect directly rather than through the chain - watch to phone to tablet."
can't get s10 to restore downloaded data file from galaxy s5. help. it downliaded all my logs but won't display my data or my profile. I also cannot find a file with an extraction method. I walk at work. a lot. like 6 miles a day a lot. I like having my steps tracked.
"Why remove Weight Management app?? That literally was the best, most powerful, most useful, most valuable part of the app. 90% of people tracking calories and workouts are doing that for weight loss or muscle weight gain purposes."
"walked on the treadmill today, using the treadmill option on my samsung 4 watch, and found the distance recording to be wildly inaccurate. 20 min walking and only went half a kilometer, when normally I can get 2.5 k in about 35 minutes. also, would love a distance target for the treadmill workout instead of calories. I do distance challenges on the treadmill and my goal is a certain distance, not calories or time. lastly, I wish they would bring weight tracking back"
"Requires 2fa (your phone number) to work. If you don't mind linking all your personal health information to your phone number and identity, than no big deal, right? Let's use the idea of security to force you to give up your privacy. Pass. Uninstalling. Update after Samsung's response: ""...now requires two-step verification to beef up the security of the Samsung account..."" They didn't even read my review. My gripe is that they DO require 2fa, and I do NOT want to link my health data to a phone number. 2fa does not increase the security if it is the company itself you are trying to keep out of the rest of your life! The app will not work without a phone number, why should that be required? Why do corporations think we want them to know more about us? Downgraded 2 stars to 1 for not actually paying attention."
"This app was great until a few days ago. Something with the GPS is not working. Sometimes it works, and sometimes it doesn't. Tonight it said we road for 23 minutes, averaged 8 mph, and went .07 miles. Something is not right."
I wish the app had more workout options like a Hiit option or zumba that was better able to track the type of workouts I was doing instead of having g to use the other option which I don't think encompasses the workout properly.
"I am joining the ranks on this topic. Why in the world of digital information, Samsung Software Developers, did you decide on this faux pas? My family and others I speak with cannot fathom this. The canned answer given to the multitude of other reviews does not and will not suffice. I have numerous Samsung products, ranging from my watch to phones and tablets to laundry machines. These purchases have been made based on the quality of the products we have experienced and expect from the brand. I'm sorry that we will not click affirmative for what I hope ends up to be a repaired glitch in the software. I and the many don't ""buy"" the experience line and await resolution to whatever is happening in the corporate structure. Thank you."
If you want to track sleep data this isn't the app to use. You use to be able to edit your sleep data when it was incorrect such as the time when you actually went to bed or woke up.
with the update the oximeter is gone. i used it a lot since i have a problem with oxygen. now i have to read it with the stress test and it doesn't track the oxygen levels over time. very disappointed.
"Absolutely excellent. I've been using this app for about 4 years. There are a couple of things I not happy about, but it's the best app I know of when it comes to fitness. I wish you can select what shoes you are wearing so you can get a good idea on how many miles you've done on a pair of shoes"
"This app for me is the best thing that happened since sliced bread. It motivates me to walk long distances, run and do other workouts with people all over the world. I love Samsung Health and my Samsung phone any day ,time and anywhere. If you have a Samsung phone, kindly give it try if you are looking to change something about your health or keeping fit. This is the best place to be!"
Is it only me who's not able to get any verification code sent to my mobile number to set up 2 authentication verification ? It happened after I updated this app last year and up until now still cannot able to proceed back to my Samsung Health account page. What do I need to do? Please respond. Thank you
"It's good app monitor not only steps but calculate sleeping duration as well as weight, calories, and hydration calculations it makes oneself prepared to take challenges for physical fitness my family and I am using it past few years. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"This app cant tell steps from pedals. Cycled 30km w/phone in off body bag. 0steps. Great. Put phone in pocket pedaled my hinny off and recorded 6000 steps in cycle mode. Is this the best you can do Samsung? Can't always depend on auto pause/start to function properly such as with a walk/cycle routine. I can't figure out how Samsung Health can figure how many calories I burn while cycling. What gear am I in? What size rims? How much gear am I toting? What is the wind direction, etc. Up/downhill?"
"Its a nice app, has many features and is user friendly, But i seriously doubt the accuracy of the estimated calories burned for exercises. As an obvious error, if i have walked faster than 6km/h it greatly increases the estimated calories burned. like if i have walked 5kms in 51mins it would be like 400kcal but the same 5kms in 49mins would be like 700kcal How could this be right? I recommend you double check all your in-app calculators for calories burned by exercise. with that fixed 5üåü Thanks"
It's horrible! I used to be able to check my stress level and pulse ox. That's was the best feature..Especially with covid around. I liked that I could check it!
"Samsung lost their minds, they have been updating all their apps by breaking them, removing good features, or ruining quality of life functionality. This app is now trash, the photo app is also trash, instead of saving an edited copy it now overwrites your original photo. What a clown company, note 20 ultra will be my first and last samsung phone. Not to mention the ads in samsung pay. Clown company."
I'm changing my review from 5 stars.  Since I've started to use the app more I've become more aware of what's missing that would make it create.  It would be nice to be able to track my monthly periods on the app as well as keep track of my birth control.  I need the ability to add that information or import it from another app.
I love my Samsung health watch It is linked to my phone but when I add it on google play to my PC I cant seem to access my personal information. I need it on my computer to send information to my dietitian and I need it on my phone for the convenience off adding food where ever I am.I am 57 so a bit average on the technology front can someone help? The app is fantastic as it covers everything
More devices need to be added to the app. The list is ridiculously small compared to what is available. I have a contour blood glucose monitor that won't connect to the app.
"With the latest update it looks as if I'm being aske to let a health app access my phone calls, and I can't get past setting up 2FA without errors. Not sure what's going on or if they just think people are going to hand over their data? Anyone know how to get the app working without handing over my.phone calls?"
"I thought an update was to fix problems, not create them! This app doesn't work well on a Galaxy S21 Ultra. It still works great on the S8+. Isn't there a way to upgrade for newer phones?"
"It's super useful, it's been a fairly accurate stat keeper for the 30 pounds I've worked off in the past few months. It's also amazing for a competitive person like me."
Unable to retrieve my health data on my computer. I have sync'd my data from my phone for over a year and now not able to see anything nor find out where the data got sync'd to. Very upsetting.
Hit and miss. I run the same loop every morning. Sometimes the app will say 2 miles sometimes 2.25 or 2.5 or 1.8...very inconsistent especially on the average pace and distance.
"I'd like to see the health app able to be accessed in emergencies as the iOS Health App can; also, a more detailed health profile capability enabling the user to input and store info such as blood type, organ donor, and managed health issues. That would be a five star app!"
Its an absolutely outrageous needless invasion of privacy that Samsung REQUIRES Phone permission. ‚Äú ‚Ä¶ So that people who have this number in their contacts can find you‚Äù. Back the Watch5 goes. Self-inflicted EPIC FAIL. Haven‚Äôt you gotten the message? This is NOT cool. Don‚Äôt bother with the scripted response.
I think this app have to indicate that GPS off when phone is in medium power saving mode... Instead it's just starting tracking and showing no kms at the end... Samsung need to fix this bug.
"When adding nutritional info for custom meals, please rearrange each nutrient in the app so that it matches the order its displayed on the FDA label (atleast for the US market), this is would make entering the information much smoother. Also, switching units from mg for most nutrients to % for vitamins and iron causes me to regularly enter incorrect values. For consistency, can you please stick with actual measured quantities?"
It keeps crashing recently. Not sure what has changed recently but now it just freezes to a blank screen with nothing visible every other time I try to use it. Sad.
"Heart broken! I love Samsung Health! I have been recommending it as my go to fitness app! Most accurate steps, most accurate workouts! I stupidily updated my app, now unless I give it permission to make phone calls with my phone I can't use it. Heart broken at having to uninstall my favorite fitness app üò≠"
"This application stop syncing my steps, even deleted, reinstalled the app, and cleaned coach memory, no luck. My Samsung smart showing correct number but application is not showing anything, by the way Bluetooth is on."
Please don't delete bad reviews about you! Introspect! This app still miscounts my steps (counted once after I stepped like 3 times) and always mess with my speed and pauses my workout while I'm still walking (well I don't know about today because I'm not using the exercise feature anymore).
"I like the app. However, you've remove the trend option from everything. I've had Covid and use the SpO2 to monitor my recovery. My doctors; yes doctors, have asked me to track my SpO2 while I'm on oxygen and several times a day when I'm off oxygen. They are try to determine if I should be taken off supplemental oxygen that I've been on for months now. I can't tell them now cause I can't sort the status and trend over weeks or months. For my sake and others, please bring back that option."
If you enter a log there isn't a way to delete it if you put it for a wrong day. It recorded intercourse but mistakenly entered it on the wrong day now it wouldn't remove it when I try to enter that day and unselect that option it just stays there. But otherwise I great app.
It doesn't track my steps as accurately as it used to . Edit : I did try all you've told me . It only fixed the step counting for walking but when it comes to cycling it counts a 15km bike ride as 3000 steps at best . It's really frustrating. I don't know what to do .
I am unable to sign in to the App. Keep giving error mesaage.
Updated app and now I can get past the two step verification. It just repeats the same two screens. It's sad because it WAS a nice app to keep track of progress made.
"its good, it could be better. the one thing my mom and i use it for is checking our heart rate, i think if you added a graph after you check your heart rate would be good. you know how you have the trends if you click it you could pull up the graph of the beats them self."
App keeps crashing after the latest update with a pop-up saying app can't be opened on a rooted device even while the phone is not rooted and the problem is that it's keep opening even when I'm not doing anything please fix this ASAP.
"Absolutely love Samsung Health and all its ever evolving features. The seamless transition between different workouts, tracking tools and mindfulness is great user experience. Thank you Samsung"
"Why do I suddenly have to allow the app to sync with my contacts just to access the challenges?? I don't want to connect with anyone I know on Samsung Health. I don't want to sync my contacts, I just want to do the challenges on my own. This is not providing me with the ""optional user experience."" Please remove that requirement so I can go back to using the app."
"I am unable to setup the app on my samsung A70. After I install the app and open, it says the following error ""This service is temporarily unavailable. Try again later. (0x07#-16) "" I have a galaxy watch active 2 and I cannot get any of the info on my phone since the samsung health app doesn't work."
"Until yesterday after having to delete the cache because of a ""glitch"", I was able to add in exercise that I did while I did not have my phone with me...such as floor exercises..... now this morning, I suddenly cannot add it. This is annoying to me."
Had an issue when app was moved over to a new phone of a different brand. But fresh installs on the watch and phone and having updated to latest and okayed all the permissions and terms to share data fixed. Now working well.
"Why would you remove the most useful feature of the app?! The ease of use of the weight management feature made this app stand out above the rest! Even when myfitnespal stopped syncing my food, I entered it manually into SSH just to use this feature. Bring back weight management!"
"I have not used the app since I stopped work in October due to a physical disability. I am now more mobile and want to track my steps but it won't register at all now. Have reset it etc, but still no joy. Looks like I'll have to get the old pedometer out."
"On top of having to use a special app to carry over my Garmin data onto this app, it won't even allow to write the step count from the watch. Meaning that I have to run with the a damn fablet in my pocket which is the reason we get those watch in the first place."
Recently bought a Galaxy Watch 4 and connected it to this app but whenever the watch gets disconnected from the phone the data of the watch does not sync with the samsung health app(when connected again) and then to sync it again I have to restart phone and watch everytime.
Why can't I check my pulse anymore and ya know the blood oxygen and something else I can't think of right now Shame. I thought about buying a watch because I wanted to not because youre trying to force me too. This is pure balderdash. TBH I've been thinking to switch the phone manufacturer for a couple months now. I have been a Avid Samsung customer for years. An advocate for Samsung Note and Galaxy series for years even got a couple of iPhone users to switch. But yall upsetting me lately.
You can't use the ecg and other functions unless you have a samsung phone. That function is why I bought and will now return the watch that this app drives. Tried reaching out to support as asked below but they are closed even though their hours say they are open. So poor support too!
"I used to love using this app, but I've uninstalled it following the last update requiring phone permissions. This is taking it too far under the banner of providing a better user experience. Samsung don't bother replying with your robot scripted answer. WE DO NOT WANT TO GIVE YOU PHONE PERMISSION EVEN IF YOU DON'T INTEND TO USE IT TO MAKE CALLS, I WOULD PREFER TO NOT HAVE THE BENEFITS OF TOGETHER FEATURE AND KEEP MY PHONE PERMISSIONS FOR MYSELF ONLY."
"I like this app, i dont use it to its potential but i can keep track of things for my chronic health problems, the only thing i would like on it is a womens health section. I had to download a separate app to log my cycle but it would be good to keep it all in one app."
I have been using Samsung health app since I had the Galaxy S8. I was content with it until I purchased a Fitbit. Too bad it is not compatible with the Fitbit or strava app. I would like to view the dashboard on the laptop.
How do i uninstall an update. The new update does not let the user to set goal weight and track the calories needed to reach it. The old version was streets ahead. The new update ruins the experience.
"I loved this app. The amount of permissions it requires in this new update is unacceptable. edit after receiving Samsung answer: Your automated answer doesn't impress me in the slightest. Your new Together feature isn't working as it should if people are complaining. Reflect on what are you actually bringing to the customers and what are you demanding from them. it's clearly a negative return for the Customers. There's no point in answering with : ""Trust us, we won't harm you"" - it's ridiculous even."
"Very invasive privacy settings in the latest update. Why does a sleep app need to be able to make phone calls on my phone? Why does it need to know what websites I am visiting, who my contacts are or anything else I do on my phone? Rather than authorize them to do that I deleted the app which I have used for 2+ years."
"I always loved this app but since I bought a new Samsung S20 Galaxy Note Ultra, it doesn't work. It will count my steps but the heart rate function no longer works nor does the stress or oxygen level. There is no obvious way to measure either. Is there a replacement app for the new phone models?"
Please allow more apps to sync with samsung health
"Used to love this app and then they updated it. Now I can no longer view my sleep trends. Why change something that worked perfectly well before. Please don't ask me to call a number, I'm registering my complaint on here. I don't have time to make phone calls. Rrally unhappy with the new app and will look for an alternative"
It was best fitness app of them all few years ago and now it doesn't work properly and wants intrusive permission like call management without which it does not let you run the app. Highly disappointed.
"I have used this app for years and loved it, however the last update has made it unusable. Won't count steps or synch with my Gearfit anymore. I can't even uninstall it since I have a Samsung phone, so it is wasted space."
"This used to be such a great app, but with each update the so-called ""improvements"" only continue to make it worse. The latest update, besides losing functionality, also now requires you to link it to a Samsung account. Sorry - no! Too many privacy violations."
"Not sure what had happened to this app but it stopped on Sept 19,2019, and wouldn't start back up. I just had to uninstall it and and reload it again. Hopefully this won't happen again. I really like this app."
What happened to weight management. My wife and I purchased 2 new galaxy watch 3s and ditched our fitbits because this was better.. however one of the reasons we did was because the calories in vs out features which was on the fitbit app and was also here. So after the switch its is now gone. Please remedy.
thats really great and make me motivated to keep continue. it's not that much user friendly for adding your friends and it's bad only there are limit number of marks on the map when you are in challenge with your friends
"Used to be great, now doesn't track steps properly. I did a 10k run this morning, and according to Samsung Health, I'd done this in 1510 steps! I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling, but cant even reinstall the app as it gets stuck on 99%. Good job I have Map My Run!"
"Hi! I really like and use this app mostly for my sleep rec and steps. I used to sleep very well, but last days I started to wake up during the night which sepatares my sleep cycles. I used this app to see when exactly I fall asleep, but in this situation I can only see when my second sleep cycle begins. Is there anything I'm not doing the right way? Could you make some update on this? Would love if you answer!"
"The food section of the this app is horrible & hopeless. It can learn from the lose it app. If they don't improve they will lose their top notch status. No barcode and very unamerican. Basically the only flaw but a major one. Unit measures suck, too."
"App works well, pretty easy to navigate my only issues is this app does not monitor blood pressure and that is a big reason I bought the Samsung bracelet, I've had an $8 dollar bracelet from Wish that used an app called H Band and it was able to monitor blood pressure... Come on Samsung step it up release an update and add blood pressure monitoring not just recording."
üëçüëçüëç‚ù§ Updated review.... not sure what happened but not long after posting my review and getting feedback Samsung App started interacting with my other apps like virgin pulse. The interactive ability with other apps is what I value most.üëçüëçüëç I appreciate the response from the developer and the issue being fixed
"the app is fine for what i use it for, keeping track of my food, sleep and steps, but i do night work so very often im having two naps in the day and when it comes to scheduling when youre asleep, it would be nice if i could add multiple entries"
"Explain to me why any app needs access to make and manage my phone calls and see my contacts, not happening...I think the next smart watch will not be the Samsung watch due to this...and I may purchase an IPhone next. I don't require the together feature so unless I want to utilize that feature then there is no reason Samsung needs access and permissions to my contacts and phone actions...not going to happen here, the app is deleted and my next watch will be a Garmin, fitbit...my next phone...?"
"USELESS SHELL OF WHAT IT USED TO BE!Doesn't have any of the features you'd remember except for the meal tracking,they remove features constantly! Like the most used/useful ones like heart rate and and oxygen through your phone in some bid to force u to buy a fit bit or whatever? Not everyone uses thatüí©!plus community is utter trash and full of pervs and cheaters who get 25k steps in a few hrs etc! Find another app that is USEFUL and will have features u can actually still use! complete waste!"
"Unfortumately this app ruins the joy of having a Samsung Watch. I have a Samsung Galaxy Watch dreaming of having a good count and history of my steps. For now, due to this app the performance of my activity is worse than a chinese watch bought with 5 eur from Aliexpress. This app has 2 ways of extracting data: from mobile or from mobile and phone. My mobile registers 5000 steps that I did not do and adds them to activity. Put the option to register only the watchs steps and fix it please."
I just realized the app stopped recording everything on/around 30 July. My fault for not checking in. I'm connected .it's just not auto-updating. Just uninstalled/reinstalled and it updated some but not all. üòë
"Does this app no longer keep track of life long mileage? Tried looking for it with no luck! I've work in a hospital for 13 years and always enjoyed showing people the mileage I've accumulated. I'm currently working in patient transport and average 10 miles a day, it's fun to see how far I've walked for the life of having this app."
"Used to love this app until they took the continuous graph off the heart rate monitor. I have a mild heart condition and used this feature daily to monitor it, the current range bars do not give the same information. Why was this feature removed??"
"I use this app on my almost daily 4-8 mile hikes. Keeps up with calories burned and number of steps. Alerts me at each mile, gives my time for each mile and maps the trail I'm on. Easy to use, even for a 70 year old."
"After latest update SPO2 missing?!  Why ? This is one of most valuable things about that app... SPO2 is missing also  in ""Manage items"" so it is not possible to enable it. That happened after latest update to 6.5.0.039 , Galaxy s8+,  Android 9"
"Just updated my S7 Edge to the latest Android and now Samsung Health doesn't work properly. I look at my history and go back in time but it sticks and wont let me go back to today without going out of the App and back in. Also since I've used it, on the day it will say for example 2556 KCal used but looking in the history it says 34kCal. Why?"
I love the app it's a good way for me to keep track of everything one thing I would love if food tracker had the option where you could scan the barcode on your food that will make it easier to catalog what your intake
"Update to Previous Review: Dropped one star. The last update now limits the view of my Custom Meals to 8. I have probably 16 custom builds in my library. When I rebuild a meal and try to save it ""again"" it says already meal by that name and won't let me add it. Also, why did you add two additional clicks to posting any meal or snack?"
"I loved this app until the recent update then it wouldn't let me access it unless I allow the app to make phone calls, use my contacts and access all the files on my phone. Explain to me why you need access to this information to be able to measure my steps???? Do not recommend you try this app unless your happy for the app to make phone calls on your behalf."
"Sleep notifications have stopped working on my S7. The Option to manually record works, but even with sleep notifications toggled on and urgent importance selected (sound and pop screen), it doesn't work."
"I bought the Active 2 in the UK for the EKG/ECG, blood pressure monitor and the SP02 monitor but none of them appear to be included with the watch or in this app!!!! All I can see is the heart rate monitor and sleep monitor etc.....I might as well have bought a cheap Chinese 'smart watch'. *****Update***** I spoke with the help desk and they guided me to an update and additional app called health monitor. I can now get blood pressure and EKG, however no SP02......an improvement nonetheless."
Non functional. I need to accept an update to the privacy policy before regaining access. But it requires an update to settings without any guidance. Sketchy and wrong. Done.
"JUL 2022: My rating used to be a 5, then down to a 2, now it's at 1 star. Can't even measure my heartrate now. Waste of time. THERE'S NO POINT REPLYING TO POOR REVIEWS TO SAY ""PLEASE CONTACT US"" IF I'M JUST GOING TO SPEND 20 MINUTES ON HOLD THEN BE TOLD ""OUR APP DOESN'T DO THAT ANY MORE""! MAR 2021: I used to love this app, but they keep taking away the useful features. I'm looking for an alternative now. Disappointing."
"New update stopped my watch from syncing sleep with phone, which is 1 of my top 3 reasons for getting a smart watch. Everything else syncs fine but now watch says ""couldn't get sleep records from phone""."
"This UI needs to be more like the Fitbit app. I want to see weeks and months ""at a glance"" with little to no effort. Maybe daily stats with every metric on one screen? Pls make it easier to nav, thanksüòî"
"As of the end of april the connected services sync to Strava stopped working (tried disconnect / reconnect), along with the map / track on my recorded items now do not show up. l switched to a non-samsung phone but still love my S4 frontier watch. Is this expected behaviour?"
"Used app for blood oxygen and heart rate. I wasn't concerned with accuracy, just as a guide. Since the last update I just get a meaningless graph, no actual figures. How can a developer update an app, but decrease it's usefulness? I'm deleting app after leaving feedback."
I downloaded the App on Hauwei p20 mate and linked it with discovery so that I can accumulate points while gyming from home but I've realized that the App is not synced and it's not recording Data. I've trying to make it Synchronize but failed
"Latest update has made the app trash. I've notice there have been a few pointing this out, and based off the developer responses it isn't going to be fixed any time soon. Prior to update it was a 5 star app."
most of time it take inaccurate readings or takes forever to read. and yes my finger is in the right place! yes I'm sitting still. yes I'm in a quiet place. stress test keeps getting stuck at 95% and stressi ng me out. so this is actually bad for your health.
"The latest update no longer works . It fails to record cycling exercise, nor allow data entered by hand to be saved. In the past I have used this app to monitor over 19000km on my bike So I have had to install a separate cycling app."
"Everything about this app is amazing! The only reason I gave it 4/5 stars is because of the food input. If this app had the food barcode reader like My Fitness Pal, I wouldn't even need to have that app on my phone. PLEASE PLEASE work on this update it will make your app the only one I and many others would have to use."
After i updated the AiA Vitality app not able to sync. Do you really do a basic testing of all possible APIs and interfaces when you update? What' s the point of upgrade if you cant ensure a basic feature of syncing?
"The sleep app doesn't track my sleep time anymore, for 4 days now. Not sure what changed."
"I have found this app to be very beneficial and helpful for me to meet my goals. However, I have found this latest update to the privacy settings to be very frustrating to the point of uninstalling this app. I continue to accept the privacy settings but it continuously takes me to my settings where there is nothing available to accept privacy settings."
New to samsung health but like it so far. Not used food tracker / my fitness pal with it but I have started to use the water intake feature and it could be better. I have a bottle that's 650ml and I can't change the 'glass' size.
I have been using this app since the first lockdown and while it is good when it works. There has been many times where it doesn't work. I could walk 2 miles and the app will tell me I haven't moved a step... I don't know if this is a bug or something? But hope it can be solved. Sadly dissapointed because I genuinely like this app.
"Can't delete accidental workouts. Clunky interface in general. 3/31: now my sleep doesn't log automatically until it guesses what I slept, then I say yes, and it doesn't break down rem, awake, etc."
After signing in the app get stuck in the loading page forever. Is both even opening. Pixel 4 - Android 11 Update: thanks for reaching out. Unfortunately this hasn't worked. I won't be able to call to an American number as I am in UK. Thanks anyway for trying .
The app provides realtime data if configured properly. Earlier for tracking every steps i had to wear my fitness band or smartwatch but this phone almost does the same with 100% accuracy.
excellent app for what it is. stress tracker has options for moods but doesnt do anything with the choice. would be great to view data sorted by mood.
Why not move forward with the times and allow it to sync with other health apps without the need for a third party? Or even allow it to sync with games like pokemon go? Pretty disappointed so far. Change my mind.
"Wish they wouldn't ask for unnecessary permissions to use the app. I don't think you need camera, contacts, phone etc just to track steps. Please remove this and put as optional for only when requesting a function that needs these permissions."
"Fine for tracking steps, weight & food but could not track blood pressure, temp, menstruation etc."
"EDIT: (updating my review) Everyone that can't get the 2 step to work, uninstall and reinstall. It finally worked!! When I did this, I was able to enter code and do the two step verification. Now it is perfect!"
"After latest update the app keeps showing up in the notification bar saying that it is running in the background. This is very annoying, thinking of uninstalling it but it i need it for my galaxy watch"
I used to use this app every day and LOVED it. Even recommended it to my friends. It still counted my steps ect. every day. However I went to open the app today to reset how many steps I wanted to take a day and it just keeps loading and loading for over an hr it drained my battery. I uninstalled it and re downloaded it and it was fine until I went to add food to the app and now its loading and loading again....
"Active2 said it had ECG monitoring at launch as of right now, on a Pixel 3, it seems like we still will never get this feature even though it's been released on Galaxy phones. There's no simple way to view your health data online in an actual usable format to show your doctors, and no way to sync your data with Google Fit besides involving some shady third party app who then charges you. This is unacceptable. False advertising and pure greed by Samsung."
"I used to love this app, but now with my new phone none of the data is pulling in even though the watch and phone are paired. Very frustrating! I have a marathon coming up and can't trust this app."
This App was 5 stars up until they got rid of the weight management tool on the App. Now I dont know how many calories to burn to be under for the day. Please explain to me how people are to lose weight when we don't know if we are over or under calories for the day? Maybe we should start a petition to bring back the weight management tool on the App!! Please don't give me the same old we will pass this message along! Actually do something about it.
"Is very good apps to control what u eat, however need to fix when im driving show up im walking and need to add more food combinations like, coffee with 2%milk and brown sugar. But all is great. I recommend to all."
"I use this app off and on to track my eating and weight. I always use it for my steps. But today when I went to use it for my current diet plan, I realized I no longer can measure my pulse with my phone. I have to get one of the watches or fit bans that are compatible with the app. Which is unfortunate, since my phone is equipped with that feature already built in it.... I really don't feel like I should have to buy another product to get the full use of this app. üòï"
Whoever programmed this update must be a burger munching fat blob who's never done a step of exercise in their life! Why did you remove the monthly graphs? Why did you take all the features from the main screen? I'm moving to another app unless you roll back to the last version. Such a shame :-( :-(
"My mother and I have been on a trip together. I have been walking next to her for days, our phones are on our bodies in separate bags but in the same place on our body, even in the same bag. My app says I've taken about half the steps as she has. We cant figure out why.. it's strange. How do we know what one is accurate? There is a huge difference between 5 miles and 11 miles"
"Been using weight goal for a month or two now and it dissapeared today. Kept me on track for calorie in versus calorie burned. I can watch the three parts it combined, but it was helpful having it in one."
Samsung Health was great before Weight Loss Management was removed. No idea why they would make this decision. Are there plans to replace this feature do to customer disappointment? Currently looking for alternative applications that include this feature.
"This apps is good. Been using since 2016. But recently, the steps tracker seems to become insensitive. Will only start to count only when the apps is launched. This is quite irritating and disruptive. Please improve on this. Thanks!"
"The widget that counted daily steps has now turned the font to a ridiculously small size. On top of that, I can't even make the widget smaller to cover the small area actually showing this small font, so there is a massive blank area doing nothing."
Woeful. Either the watch doesn't work properly or the app's algorithms are garbage. Constantly gets sleep times and floors wrong. Still no blood pressure function. Give me an email address to contact please.
They have ads in this app! Hard to believe they have ads from everything from juice makers to underware in a core app of theirs. Just shows how bad a company Samsung rally is. Just stupid! They replied saying they have none but it's obvious at the top of the app's main page. They may be in the form of partner discounts but they're still ads!
"Why does the watch not count floors correctly unless you live in a mansion?? I've searched forums and many many ppl have this issue. How is it that a smaller company like fitbit can get it right,but Samsung can't? I thought I was upgrading from my fitbit...please fix this."
"This app is destroying the battery life of the Gear S3 - perhaps Samsung should pay more attention to their users - go take a look at the Samsung Reddit forum. Why would I call an American number to be told it's a fault with my watch? Samsung have messed up the Gear S3, until they sort out the battery issue, I would no recommend anyone to buy Samsung! They're robbing everyone off, not making any effort to sort the issue, and even less effort to address their users."
"Catastrophic app... used it for 3 years and suddenly they decided that they need to offer me more protection... 2 way verification for banking I can withstand, but for a selly app that counts my steps and measures pulse is a NO NO. Why can I decide if I need one. Who are you to say what I need. If you want I can even pay you samsung just STOP saying me what to do and worry about my protection. Now I can not use my pulse sensor on my phone... life is becoming more extreme."
Used to love this app was accurate in every way helped me lose 4st now put a bit of weight back on using it again... .. so many bugs does not count steps properly or workouts have tried uninstalling and reinstalling but still the same will not use again üòû
I can't get the thing to run for more than 5 mins. It freezes. Won't respond. I clear it out. Won't open. I have to uninstall it and reinstall just to get it to open. Amd 10 mins later it freezes.
Awful. Used to be good. After the last update the app will no longer sync with my galaxy4 watch. The app no longer tracks anything and is frozen most of the time.
Good app but when I checked the moonlight global challenge leaderboards to see where I placed amongst other users I was quite surprised to see Donald trump at the top and he'd already racked up a quarter of a million steps and we are only a few hours into the challenge! Surely he must have put his fitbit on a centipede or something. edit: worked out that he must walk two steps a second for 24 hours a day to achieve the amount of steps he has Lol
"I'm pretty sure that some people are misusing the app to get to number one on the leader board. There are some people who would have to have done almost 100km per day to get in the top ten, especially when they finish the challenge in the first few of days of the month."
I think they could add so not only like the S7 Edge can measure stress but every new phone that has a fingerprint sensor. Beacause I can't buy a samsung watch in my region and I need to know what my stress level is or what my blood pressure is.
"Was loving this app until it started resetting my steps at different times of the day, which has lead to me now losing my place in the top 3% in about 3 days I have gone way down to the top 47% which of course is very annoying as I use this app daily to keep track of my fitness and participate in the challenges. Is anyone able to tell me why this happening"
"App is very good. One suggestion to developers, please update the app to stop automatic deleting of downloaded programs. For the same program I have to download everyday. It is so irritating."
It is pretty basic and lack a lot of features and functionality as compared to Garmin Connect. The interface is also so mundane. It really has a lot of catching up to do.
"Deleted the app after the latest update was forcing me to create a Samsung account and share all my data with anyone they like. I've used this app for years happily on my phone, never had to sign into anything before. Why can't it just count my steps and measure my heart rate on my phone like it has for 4 years? Very unhappy."
I don't really use it and after the last update it runs all the time and is using an astonishing amount of battery. Last night it drained 20% of my Pixel 6 while I slept and the watch was powered down! I'm uninstalling it now.
The most recent update removed the ability to look at weight as a weekly or monthly view and now it's just saying without the about to compare. Steps and active minutes can both be viewed in a weekly but not weight.
The App was really great. Shame on you that you gutted the application and removed weight management. I completely regret now that I purchased a Samsung Phone and Galaxy watch. How tone-deaf can you possibly be. Enjoy alienating your customer base. And stop copy-pasting the same pre-formatted reply. It is patronising.
I really love the app and it's been perfect for me. It gave an option to update and after update it's not going past the login and agreeing to new privacy terms. Saying unknown error.
"It's great for tracking steps and workouts, along with food, caffeine, weight, and even heart rate and stress level if your device supports it. You can even do step challenges with friends!"
Samsung's health app has helped me lose weight and maintain a higher level of exercise this last year. The challenges are fun and the option to go head to head sparks a competitive nature.
"Up to a month ago I was able to track different workouts and exercises--running, weight lifting, aerobics. Now I can only track steps. There are no options to add exercises. Or manually add exercises. What happened to this app? Is terrible now."
"Was a happy user for years until an update demanded perms to make calls and locked me out of all functionality until granted => UNINSTALLED!!! EDIT in response to reply: Samsung asks us to trust that the perma the app demands will be used responsibly. With no mistakes Always and forever. These days that's a bridge too far. Instead be minimal with the perms requests, be explicit about the benefits of each (not just 'optimal experience '), and Let. Me. Choose."
Not a bad start. I'm using the L16 smartwatch which has Blood pressure Steps Sleep cycle Running/walking/swimming etc Blood oxygen ECG Heart rate And even calculates mental and physical stress as well as a fatigue index. I connect the watch to google fit via its own fit cloud app then to this via health sync. But this doesn't have blood oxygen or ECG. Not a bad start but don't stop now... Plenty to do..
"Forcing 2FA/MFA to stop exposure to Together service? I didn't opt in to that. Shouldn't we have a choice to opt out of inconvenient and unnecessary options or services we dont want? (2FA or ""together"" service). Someone going to steal our steps or ""health data""? Really??? I hope you are reading this Samsung. Please give ppl a choice instead of forcing unnecessary inconveniences and you can protect our data by anonymizing it. Or is this just another excuse to obtain phone permissions?"
"Getting better over time but, please, as with other Samsung apps, could we have an option to turn off the adverts on the top section? On the ¬£1000+ phone I'd expect not to see a single add from first party apps. Finally no adverts!"
The sleep tracking looks like different from other apps. I'm tested Garmin and Xiaomi together with Fit Band 2. Both Garmin and Xiaomi show i have longer deep sleep and less awake. However in Samsung Health is is total reverse between the deep sleep and awake. This is apps bug?
Fed up. Here it is apri 1st challenge just started and 3 members almost at 200000 sep. Samsung really needs to step up and deal with the cheating . Obviously you can see it happening before you. Come on samsung. This is frustrating for honest users
"Absolutely love this app and everything about. Helps me to keep all aspects of my health on record and On track. Helps me keep my workouts on hand, love the programs, products. This is one of the best apps I have."
"Permanent installation of junk apps can be removed by ""you"" the developer when reformatting the app by simply adding ""uninstall"" like most have when already installed from the manufacturer/company. Hell, I can't even remove the BS from my home screen, the icon app is grey and no ""trash can"" appears to remove the icon! üñïüñï"
"Overall I like the app. New update is requiring permission to access contacts and calls. The answer to that is NO. Now I can't use it, so I have uninstalled. Oh well back to paper it is..."
"Was a great app, but now forces me to allow it to manage my calls. There is no reason this app needs to manage my calls other then Samsung selling/using my information for things other than this app. Shady... Samsung updated the privacy policy and if you don't agree to let the app manage all your calls you can't use it. After declining permission twice to manage my phone calls it locked me out of the program. I will stop purchasing Samsung products if this invasion of privacy this continues."
"the app looks nice, keeps track of your exercise routine and show you progress in a good way, however the app has a big flaw as it calculates the distance i travel by car and consider as a running exercise"
Rooting Error...I loved the app but now I can not open it. I have not rooted my phone. Not sure why I can track my activity any longer. I do see on my pull down my step count but I cant use any other function. Annoying! I have used this app for a few years now.
Why did you removed the Oxygen Saturation Measurement (spO2) feature when my device holds the sensor? I can't expect this to happen to a flagship device. We pay more for these premium phones just for these kinds of added little things. Very Bad move Samsung! üëé Now tell me what should I do with that useless sensor.
"I just bought mi scale v2 and tried connecting it with the Samsung health app, but it is not detecting. please fix this issue otherwise remove mi scale from accessories list. I purchased it because it was shown under accessories list that is supported by samsung health app. but now its not working."
I love it and recommend it. But more synchronization is needed between the watch active 2 and my A70. For example some workouts are not there so when I choose them on the phone my watch shall start telling me my heartbeat and time ...
"Love this app and love the challenges! Edit: I do have 1 problem though....theres not enough activities for workout input. If I jump on a trampoline for 15 mins I can't put it in because there's no Trampoline workout...but there's ballroom dancing, ice dance ect...things youd think are alot less common."
"Loved this App, but dont like current version. Cannot now just count steps from my Gear S3. Only phone and watch. Useless, no longer accurate. I cannot find a ""More"" setting. There is a note saying steps from Gear S3 cannot be counted separately."
I don't see SpO2 option on my galaxy s8. Stress option is available though. Thank you Samsung dev for the quick response. As a developer I bel it eve that updates must be better than previous version and I consider the removing of features as a downgrade. Sorry Dev!
"The latest update is ridic. Since last 3 days, I have walked zero steps according to Samsung health... How am I to know for how much time I am active when it simply doesn't count the steps? If this continues for another day or two, I'm surely going to switch to some better app."
"can't sign in with my Samsung account. I've tried clearing cache and data, app won't sign in. I've even uninstalled and reinstalled, app STILL won't sign in. I've only been able to see the loading screen animation all night"
"Why does the app need permission to manage phone calls? The generic response from Samsung is that it improves the user experience, but there is no mention of how it improves the user experience. I will no longer use the watch until this invasive requirement is removed."
"Recent update trashed any syncing capabilities. Nothing is being tracked, deleted the app, reinstalled it no luck. Restore your last IOS before your last update and send it out. Now with today's update, the ecg doesn't work anymore"
Good app but there is no daily record of your progress because it resets at midnight. I should be able to see a daily record of each day. Limited rewards don't help either.
"The sleep timer is garbage, it doesn't allow changes making it actually useless. The calorie counter is a random number generator no remember or reason how it creates the number for a workout....................The posted fix did not fix the issue"
"With this app seems like everything ok, but is disappointing one thing when sending messages when this app thinks is ok, especially when i have a baby and he just fall asleep apps just giving notification and he's is a waking up. Here have to be time when this apps can send notification."
"I used to love this app. I could track my coffee intake, add workouts on it and now I can't do that anymore and I am very disappointed. I used to use it when hiking because I loved the traking it had on it, now I can't even do that. I would really love to see all that come back, then I would use this more often. but since all that has taken out I hardly use it at all. but I do like the menstrual part of it though."
"Samsung... Please do everyone a solid and stop using BMI for weight - it's hugely inaccurate since anyone with a decent amount of muscle on their frame is considered overweight coz your using BMI, which just isn't true and needs changing or removing entirely. BMI is widely known to be a garbage metric that no one takes seriously anymore & is not doing your app any favours by using it... 3 stars, app's good but 2 stars removed for using a shoddy metric to calculate whether someone is overweight."
"Decent health tracker, terrible sleep monitor. There is no ability to delete sleep moments or edit actual sleep time without deleting the whole thing. I can't tell you how many times it's saying I'm asleep when I'm actually sitting up at my desk. It throws everything off."
Great companion if you have Samsung. Pretty good if you don't. Does what tracking health stuff app do. It's the most comprehensive one I know that doesn't need particular products. The Sync with Google is just steps.
I have been using this app for around 3 months now and for the past few days the app has been crashing and was unable to open. In an attempt to fix the problem I lost all of my data from the past 3 months. which to be honest I am gutted about. So now I have to start all over again. is there anyway for me to get my data back or is it gone for good now ? apart from that the app has been really useful.
Really enjoy this app as it makes managing weight so much easier. The calorie counter helps you know what to eat to either lose or gain weight. The walking challenge is a good way to keep active.
the temprature and humidaty wedget is removed ? my old data from previous app can not be downloded from servers .and this UI is not user friendly to me why so many changes ? and also its not a issue its a feature removal and giving no alternative .
"GPS isn't the best. Steps dont track well indoors or when phone is held tightly. Doesnt show that many health features. No weekly total steps, no monthly total steps, year over year. Just daily steps and averages"
"Not user friendly at all. Can't look at your daily data unless you look at it the same day. Can't edit data, ex. Sleep record. You can only delete it."
"Does not allow any other watch to use this app, as in, google fit isnt allowed to share data with it from my TiWatch Pro. So my steps wont count towards the daily count, other than my phones wildy inaccurate pedometer... Wanted to use the fitness programs with some friends,.. way to spoilt it samsung."
This app was fine but as of the last update it's completely worthless. I can't open it on my phone (a pixel 5) and can't find an answer to the problem. This has been fixed and I can finally access my info. I appreciate the help of the app developers!
"Various food time viz chot, nun chai, krippe, katlam chochivor, Lavasa, are missing. picture of each food items is required as it takes a lot of time to select the food while scrolling. The ingredients of each food item if add will definitely make the app awesome."
"App used to be very helpful to me, but the latest update they got rid of weight trends and only showing individual days now, which makes it totally useless as you need to be able to view longer timeframes to keep track of your weight gain/loss"
"Used to be a good app. Now it wants access to everything on my phone. This is unnecessary given what the app does. Very disappointing. In response to Samsungs generic response : since the permissions are not needed for the app to function properly, why ask for permission to begin with?"
"I just want to say THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU!!!!! I have loved your app for many years. You made some changes on the last update where you did not give us macros totals. I made a review about that saying how disappointed I was since I use this app to track my macros. Today, I noticed that you added macros to the totals again!!!!!!"
this Apps is really help me to motivate me to walk everyday. even though still need minor improvement particularly in statistical data. and the history of previous global challenge should be accessed any time.
"Latest update, Version 6.17.0.019 now requires access to my contacts in order for it to work, so I've quit using it. I don't use it for challenging people or whatever so It doesn't need access to my contacts. I'm tired of apps that try to justify access so they can get our private info."
"Really good aside from calorie tracking and mileage tracker, though I don't have a smart watch as well which may allow this app to perform at a higher level than it currently does."
Generally been OK but now for past week it states as updating and no data available. I've reset phone and done all the usual things but still no change. Please sort it out as clearly a glitch with the app.
Since my last review of this app about weekly and monthly trends being missing i got a reply from Samsung telling me to call a US number to discuss my issue! Otherwise to email them but the address was a noreply address! Please reinstate weekly and monthly trend statistics or tell me how to find them. The overview of the latest updates says that they can be found in exercise history but they are not there
"DONT USE. After creating and CLEARLY winning challenge that all participants agreed i won, samsung gave the win to someone randomly. So they cheated me out of points i physically worked real hard to earn. And they put a loss in my column with no points awarded. They are LIARS, THIEVES AND CHEATERS. DONT USE. No Samsung u cheated. I clearly won the challenge, all participants agree but I gave the win to someone who was 4 days behind me."
I truly love this app. I track my numbers everyday. I have heart failure. Using this give peace of mind as I do my daily activities and help me communicate with my doctors.. But sadly I am forced to look for another app because it doesn't offer ECG anymore. The reason I purchased my galaxy 3 and my galaxy note 10 plus was to track my health. Really feeling some kind of way üòå
"Frankly the HR monitor is rubbish. Occasionally nothing registers at all - the line jumps up and down and the pulse line ""waves"" appear clear and even, but the app simply refuses to register a number."
This used to be my go to app to track steps and calories burnt etc until they removed core features leaving a shell of what it was. It's great having a $300 watch that no longer does the basics. Be better Samsung
App is so great and helpful to maintain a track calories intake and burned.. But only one thing is not there in updated version is weight management column Please try to fix it as it is very helpful to know over or under calories
This app was working fine until a few days ago. All of a sudden i wake up in the morning and it has already a few thousand steps registered. I Uninstalled and reinstalled tonite. We will see how it works tomorrow morning.
"Not a fat chance in hell I'll be allowing this app to MANAGE my phone calls! Like what!? Time for a new app, just in time for me to switch to my iPhone and buy an apple watch instead. Ps; there's no need to access my phone calls for ""implementing app features and providing an optimal experience,"" what do my personal/business phone calls have to do with it? It would violate HIPAA for me to grant access to my phone calls and that would land me in PRISON."
"I enjoy this apps. However, my main issue is those who cheat on the global steps. Taking away from those who are legitimately making efforts on steps. I hope you all come up with some strategy and also make new designed maps for each month."
5 min of wasted time trying to setup. First the app asks permission to manage calls... Okay after proceeding forces to setup MFA. To get phone number?? Fine... But won't allow to enter the code received in my Google voice number. The app expecting to read all messages to verify? Wow this is next level in setup process. Uninstalled and spend another 5 min writing this review!!
Unable to sign in recently on my one plus 7t. No option to skip sign in. I'm trying to sign in since last few days and it just shows me loading screen. What's up with this app? Tried all methods didn't work any.
Inability to accurately edit workout. Exercise bike and biking function does not feature the manual distance & calories entry for calculation into workout. The app also does not pull the data from the Noom app.
"Pretty good overall. If you expect it to pick up on your runs without you tracking it manually, it will be way off. Other than that, good."
"Use for daily step count, sleep patterns, workouts (back in the gym days) and recently challenges... trying to integrate with my digital scale from Renpho.... would be nice to integrate bmi, fat%, etc... love the hourly nudges to get up when I've been sedentary on zoom calls!"
"I seriously don't understand what everyone is complaining about it's litterly just a slightly different look. No functions are missing and it really isn't that drastic. If you're reading the reviews I'll be honest these people are just going over board for a slight change in design. It works just the same, you don't have to figure out how much calories you ate and how much you have left, the walking just has a different look. The functions are the same just a small design change. Calm down."
"I don't recommend getting a Samsung Smart Watch. If you want to pay ‚Ç¨300 to be told a small scratch on the screen (of an item that you wear on your wrist, it's inevitable) will void your FREE manufacturing warranty of a charging problem, then go ahead! Pay ‚Ç¨150 to have a manufacturing problem fixed that should be free of charge."
updated review 7:08am: I unstalled the app and reinstalled and now the app is working but my data is gone. I had to start all over again. I updated this app yesterday and now it won't open. what happen? I love this app. please fix. Is anyone else having the same problem?
"This app has many great features. Expessualy when you have the galaxy watch. Some people may find this wierd but my favorite part is that it records my snoring. Just found out I actually do snore. If you have a galaxy watch, I highly recommend using this app."
You'd think the software would know I'm not sleeping while posting on the phone that tracks my movements.
"I have factory reset my phone, been on phone with Samsung support for hours, had Best Buy Geek squad spend hours trying to resolve. Now what?"
"For this app to be really useful, it needs to be able to incorporate data automatically from other fitness apps such as Strava, ride with GPS etc. As it stands it's merely ok."
The new version has eliminated the option to enter several Snacks info. It was so useful to compare during the day. Please include that option.
"I'm very disappointed. Before the recent update, I loved this app so much as i could see the ""weight control"" setting like i could see when to eat and how much I have over eat. But now the weight control setting is gone!"
As soon as I had an update and it said it needed to have permission to make phone calls I uninstalled it. There is no reason for this app to demand phone access to be used GOODBYE no 2nd chances. FYI I am an ISO 27001 consultant and auditor and an expert in IT Service Management. There is no reason the app needs phone permissions not acceptable.
App was working fine until I tried to access the feature that keeps track of water intake. Now all I get is as error # and the message to contact customer service. PLEASE FIX THIS!
"They should add an option for pregnant women. I love how it keeps track of your steps, stress, & calorie intake along with other nutritional information. I know my stress level is always high from not being properly read due to my pregnancy."
"This morning I climbed 10 flights before I even got out of bed - I know, you're impressed. Other days, I literally walk up 4 or 5 floors and my watch thinks it was 2. And I can't access this app on my phone. All in all, a winning health system."
"This app really keeps you motivated and it makes it easy for you to connect your accessories such as a watch or fitbit. Believe it or not they work with other apps to help you reach your goal... like if you havent started, what are you waiting for??"
Crashes a lot. Very unreliable. You will just find yourself surprised and annoyed on how it did not manage to track your daily step counts at the end of the day.
"Does not track my sleep properly, had to purchase an app to do it and now the Samsung Health App is not syncing with my watch. Everytime I go into Samsung Health adn click sleep, it says the app isnt responding and closed! You would expect better from Samsung!"
"With the recent update, why have you taken away a feature for weight management? And your response is we will let our app developers know. If it was already developed you didn't need to ""amend"" it, the developers had done their job and you go and take it away. I am really struggling to understand how you found this to be a good idea. I know lets annoy everyone and take a useful feature away so we have something to do again, eg: field complaints."
"The calorie count on my Galaxy active 2 watch sucks I've noticed I was barely burning any calories during the day. Maybe like 20 calories if I didn't do any ""workouts"" also ran some tests on my own. They have an exercise called other workout and I tried that on while sleeping to see if it would actually track calories . . . . I burnt over ""1200 calories"" while sleeping. This is proof that they don't actually have a method to track calories, it's all pre-programmed doesn't actually track you."
"The app was working PERFECTLY why did you have to ruin it ? I don't get this new update 1st it didn't wanna work then i had to uninstall it and reinstall it again only to ask me for permission to access to my contacts then when i actually agreed it said ""an unknown error has occurred (0√ó0B) what does that even mean ?????? It was a great app made my fitness life easier now it doesn't even work. FIX IT"
"After the latest update, I am unable to open the app at all. Every time I try to open it It shows some message as 'An Unknown Error has occured. (0√ó2A#0)'. I tried reinstalling several times but its not working."
Updating my to review to new update. I used to use this app everyday for my workouts. Due to contacts permissions on my new phone. It gives an error message keeps crashing without permissions. I will download another app.
The app just keeps on loading for hours after I enter my credentials. Tried clearing cache and also did a restart but of no use. Please help to get it sorted. I tried to call on below given number but to no avail. I am situated in India. Can you provide a number from India.
"Ads from Samsung in an app from Samsung. This app nearly encapsulates my Samsung experience to date. Edit: thanks for the canned reply. Can I get an EKG reading from my gw3 on my Pixel phone yet? No. That's why I switched to Fitbit. Also, The have no in app ads."
Without the weight management function it has become a lot less useful. Now need to use other apps instead of an integrated platform. Shame I have invested so much in Samsung product to now have it wasted by reduced functionality.
"God I hate this app ! It keeps track of all the garbage I eat and gets me back in line, it tells me to get off my butt and get moving. It's the coach that never leaves. I also bought a Samsung smartwatch, I hate that thing too. Keep up the good work. I've lost 10 lbs in a month."
"Pedometer that can't be used without allowing it to make to manage phone calls after the update. Never needed any additional features before, and surely won't be needing it now."
"Love this app, however I cannot get the exercise and steps to sync into MyFitnessPal app. Very frustrating. But when I manually enter my execuse into MyFignessPal it syncs into Samsung Health so I have double fitness and steps."
Disappointed no stress and SpO2 measurement. Anyway to have it back? Thanks The irony is that because the app was updated and the blood oxygen measurement was removed. It is good for caregivers to use that on the spot for the elderly as the measurements are fairly accurate and reliable.
"used to be good, but you can use it even limited without extensive permissions for Samsung Account. More exactly, you can't use the application anymore if you don't have an enforced 2FA on phone number with Samsung account. So you have to deal with application permissions and with Samsung account permissions. On top Samsung support no matter what you ask, only give a standard answer about how to activate 2FA for Samsung Account. I spent 1 month with them for nothing. now I can't use the app."
"It is ok, but better use dedicated apps to all the functions it offers. When you have it installed on several devices, when carried with you while walking, it will duplicate the number of steps."
Please add a spot where I can track my period!!!! Also it would be helpful if there was an option to track sickness if someone gets sick a lot or mental illness like anxiety levels!I would give this app 5 stars if I could track my period!
"App was perfect before the recent update. After recent update we can't see heart beat data when I ""Start Workout"" on phone and wearing Galaxy watch and is connected to phone and functional. Which we used to see before recent update. Can you please fix this?"
"Love the app. Use it daily. Tracking meals for my nutritionist. Wish you would add ability to further expand the nutritional info details to see all foods that input into each category. I like how it is, just add one more level so if i click protein, i can see all the sources instead of just 3."
So a Samsung watch was just purchased for me and I was so excited to use it..I was wearing a Fitbit Versa which I really liked and loved the female health tracker.. since I finally have this watch I'm like ok I'll go ahead and settle in with Samsung health (I've had several galaxy phones but never really got into using Samsung health) I'm so disappointed that this app does not have a female health tracker after all these years. ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
"it's not syncing with my gear fit. it shows my activity time, but zero steps. also not showing nutritional levels when entering food. this has all been since the last update."
"The fitness tracker has stopped working! I've now uninstalled it since for me the most important feature no longer works. 18/03/20 - weird, Step counter started working again. I didn't do anything to restart?"
"Used to love this app but now that it's removed connectivity for anything but Samsung fitness bands its totally useless. After using for many years, I am leaving. I'm sure I'm not the only user who refuses to be bullied into buying one of their products to monitor steps when I have always transferred Fitbit steps snd just got a new Fitbit 6 months ago. Shame."
"I have relied on this app for years. Since my phone updated last week, my Samsung Health app no longer works. It is stuck on 392 steps with circling dots. Really, really not impressed with your update Samsung!"
Works 96 percent of the time. Except I have had to uninstall and reinstall it in order for the steps to be counted in the monthly challenge. Very annoying
I really like the app.. I just wish there would be more training regimens. I'm rating 5 stars because I use all the time and I do a weekly 10 mile run along with my other workouts. I would just like to see more training from the app. other than that its great
"I know I'm alone on this, but the app requires you to use a sim card before continuing setup and I don't exactly have one just yet. If you guys could make having a sim card optional, that would be greatly appreciated!"
I've been experiencing glitches in the app since a week. One glitch is that the audio guide isn't working. Another glitch is that the estimated total time isn't correct and the difference in the estimate and actual time taken for the activity is around 45 minutes minimum.
The update has made the app unusable on my Galaxy S8. Had to uninstall and reinstall. After hitting the agree button the status wheel just spins..... Going to try another app and if it works I will be removing this from the device.
"Great app, but the downfall is that I can't use Garmin devices (which I spent a lot on) which would make everything simpler. Developers: work on this and you'll get all kinds of great recommendations from me, and I'm sure others."
"Latest update makes the app useless. The running tracking has not worked for my last 2 runs. And auto ""workout"" detection is completely erroneous. Terrible."
App is good but the problem is if I'm traveling by car then it still counts my steps I don't know if it's my galaxy watch or my phone but even when I'm traveling by car or bike it counts steps. And this can really mess up your entire Samsung health app As the data won't be useful. Please fix it.
"So sad about the recent update...lost more than 5 years of calorie personalized data and workout tracking. No fitness app needs access to my phone calls, contacts, photos, etc. Absolutely ridiculous!!!"
"Actually amazing at tracking your health. So many foods to log, and if it isn't there the uou can add it manually. Ability to track my exercise calories burnt, and my calorie goals. Recommending this to everyone. Would be better if you could share or track proverbs with friends"
This also has a banner ad that I cannot disable when I load into the app. I dont care if its hidden when you scroll down. I turned off the marketing options and its still there. I said no. This sleazy business practices is detestable elsewhere but is particularly gross in a healthcare service. Are you selling my biometric data to advertisers? I cant trust you. Samsung I read your reply and called your hotline as per your reply. Fix this.
"Like many others, the removal of the heart rate and oxygen monitors has made this app practically useless to me. Adding these functions back to the phone is essential for me to start using this app again on my S10."
"It's great but weoose steps. It wld be great if we cld have an option to define challenges with a custom message like, taking a break at the moment or not taking challenges due to work schedule etc."
cycle tracker isnt working
"Takes multiple attempts to log in, and doesn't sync data over multiple devices either takes away a lot of the usefulness of having an app to keep everything in one place."
"Stopped providing sleep information, although my watch recorded my sleep. No graphs or amount of time spent in sleep cycles. Very disappointed. Cleared the cache and it still is not working"
"Loved this app but somewhere on one of the updates I lost the stress test feature. Wife still has it but I can't figure out how to get it back. I loved the O2 sensor on it, was very helpful. Doctor told my dad if he had used that feature they would have caught his blood clots sooner."
Sorry for changing my review from 5 star to 1 star. I loved this app because of weight management feature that helped me lose weight as well but now the developers have removed that feature. Big thumbs down to all developers. Hope you amend it. Else you'll lose a loyal Samsung health fan and member and maybe more members in times to come. Please restore this feature else I'll be forced to use another app that helps me in monitoring my calories burnt
"After years of using your app, you've finally want to far by requiring my contacts/phone permissions. What could you possibly need that for?! Not functionality. Nooo. Your gonna have to steal it just like everybody else. This also helps my desicion making when thinking about a new phone. I've read your replys to the comments regarding this. Makes no sense! Cya samsung..."
"A few additions I would like to suggest; - Having my resting heart rate for the day instead of the average - in the heart rate and sleep tracker, being able to touch certain points on the chart and see the time it occurred - A chart (pie?) that consists of each exercise category I've tracked to see how my activities have broken down during the month - The ability to move 2 items on a line of the dashboard that then turn in to a square instead of a rectangle; i.e water and coffee on the same line - Manual add water in ml; my water bottle is 828ml which does not evenly devide by the 250ml cups - Ability to add more than 3 photos to activities and add them in multiples instead of one at a time - A continuous heart rate chart on the front page of the heart rate item"
Another samsung hiccup.. Why can't you make simple apps? The new update forces me to setup 2 step verification . But i dont want to setup! The sms never arrives even on full network so till then i can't sync my watch and see my activity. Great! Pathetic seriously.
"I use to love this app. It helped me greatly with my excersise. But Samsung had to go & add permissions to be able to use it. I don't want to give my contacts info to you & you DON'T need to manage my calls. You're invading my privacy here. Love it, but no more."
This was a great app until last week with the new update we lost the calorie counter. That was the best part it kept me in line. I would work out more to keep my count at a good level.
The app is not tracking my steps despite updating it
"Used to use this app every day. Today Samsung updated its privacy policy and now I have to allow them access to literally my entire phone and all data, functions, etc. They seem to be very out of touch with where consumer sentiment lays these days. Hence, I have stopped using this app."
"Requires unnneccary access in order to work. Required access to my contacts and I could see their step count which I do not need. Today, app requires access to make and receive calls in order to work. Will be selling my watch for fit bit. GaRBAGE! There are no reasons for this app to demand so much private information If Samsung ever gets a data breach, I will be the first at the class action suit. Please govern yourself accordingly."
"Weight Management Widget Gone?! I don't understand why on earth Samsung would get rid of this widget. It was the most viewed data in the app for me. Despite the fact that I still like and wear the Gear watches, I don't find much value in using this app anymore."
"You should include negative impact things as part of your health as well. For example: smoking, alcohol consumed, video gaming time, ext. We all do something that isn't good for us, I think you should include some of those things as a way to monitor our selves. Just a thought."
"Used to love using it for tracking period but the new update deleting all my data, steps, heart rate data, and period its annoying as hell as someone who has a irregular heart rate i try to keep a watchful eye on it with my families history of heart attacks but now nothing works and all datas lost gotta find a better app"
No Google Fit sync? It's just bloat until you make it play nicely. I'll continue to use ad-ridden 3rd party heart rate monitor apps that DO sync with Google Fit. We are on Android (and bought your hardware) because of Google.
It was perfect and recorded everything until yesterday night when stopped recording anything and it still wouldn't until I deleted and redownlouded it 2 times and now the data it collected before is on the wrong day. Edit: it's frozen again
"I like this app, but the most recent update is really disappointing. The continuous heart rate display was removed and replaced with bars that show hourly highs and lows. I really dislike it. Is there a way I can go back to the old version?"
## EDIT I understand that you use them to implement app features but you still need to explain why you need them. ## It's not a big issue but it would be better to explain why you need the permissions you ask. Why do you need the SMS for example? Can't you ask for the permission only when required? A more serious problem is that the app shows sticky notifications that I can't swipe out.
Awful marketing messages and restricted access to the ECG function. Samsung placed a revolving set of 5 marketing messages at the top on the screen that cannot be removed. This is after you turn off marketing notices in the preferences. Seems a crass and classless marketing approach. Further I have a Watch 3 and I can not use the ECG measurement feature since this is restricted to use with Samsung phones. This restriction was not stated when I purchased the phone.
Just had an update on my phone and can't get the oxygen level anymore. Works differently on my S21+ than on the S10+. It was easier to use on the S10+. You need to improve the app.
"I'm having trouble syncing my hband 2.0 to this app, hband 2.0. watch is sync with Google. And also my OKOK scale of Bluetooth scales. Please email me advising Other than this it's looks great."
"I would really like it more if I could track the calories that I burn everyday. You can check sleep tracking for as long as you want but can't for calories burner. For example, If i want to check calories burnt last week I can't. Would be helpful if this feature is added"
"Can't open on Galaxy S8. Says my phone is rooted. But its not. Update - it was an android update that caused the issue, Samsung released new update, problem has been resolved. App works great."
"Dear Samsung Development Team, I shouldn't need to clear my cache to make it work. I shouldn't be caught in an endless loop trying to agree to a privacy notice and then trying to fumble through settings that once changed continue to not allow you to accept the privacy notice. I shouldn't need to uninstall and reinstall an app to make it work. I shouldn't need two-step verification on my Samsung account to use this app. Do I really need to call Samsung support to make this app work?"
It's a great app and it helps me track my activity well. I used to have it on my Samsung Galaxy A5 and the step counter was accurate. But now I just got a Samsung galaxy A20 and my steps are incredibly inaccurate. And shows much less than what I'm actually doing. Can anyone help me with this?????
"Asking for too many permissions. To answer the reply, I don't see how having access to phone, contacts and more will enhance the experience. I've had this app for a few years without these permissions and I have yet to see a problem. So what exactly does it enhance?"
Unable to open. User name issue and can't reach customer care...
"I've used this app off and on for years, I truly appreciate it however they removed the HR/BP/Oxygen features and that's what I really used and liked the most. Also now the step counts seems to be off. Beem walking with a couple of friends for a few weeks now and their steps counts are way off from mine which was much lower than theirs. Updated: while I appreciate your response regarding the steps. You totally disregarded my comments related to the features I mentioned being removed."
"slow, lacking functions, unnesesary large space for advertisement... ... and not working. >Reply: I consider Samsung ""promo"" banners in current form as an advertisement. And it is really annoying to read ""buy the latest watch to measure EKG"" when you have one generation older model which has been promissed to have EKG some time before but still nothing."
"Worked well for years, but changed phones and Samsung health is recording less than half the number of steps that the old one did when used at the same time 12/2/2021 It appears that the Pause Mode seems to keep going on and on and does not count Steps"
"This app is absolutely useless. When I installed on my huawei phone, it wants me to sign into my Samsung account before I can use it. Every time I try to log in it just keeps scrolling and won't log into my account. So can't use my Samsung fit 2 band on this phone. Waste of time."
"integrates well with my fitness pal. tracks food, water, caffeine and has a weight management section. relatively intuitive design and I have not had an issue with this app yet."
"In the food section of the app, Samsung Health changes your personal foods percent daily value amounts to unit of measures on the vitamin intake screen. For example, if I create a food containing 100% DV of Vitamin C, it displays it as consuming 100mg of Vitamin C instead of 90mg. This may result in unkowingly consuming too much of something, leading to negative health effects. The app also fails to record the number of stairs climbed."
Unable to start the app It is stuck at the login page where i agree to the privacy policy. I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app but it doesn't start at all The number you provided is not valid. Do you think it's a joke to give wrong number
I was so excited to use this app until recently. When i dont have it open or using another app a box pops up saying its not responding. It even closes out what ever app i have open. I have updated this app i have even uninstalled and reinstalled it & still it continues. At this point I am annoyed and will be uninstalling it for good.
"Good program. Very consistent with lots of options. I do find the GPS records an actual mile as 1.1 miles. Other than that, it's been great."
"I feel like SHealth was much better when it was really a health app. I liked that I could telehealth a doc, track my glucose, set goals, and actually use the app to be in better health. Now its little more than a calorie and step counter."
"The voice guide after last update is behaving insane. The robot sound actually irritates during my rides. Developers need to fix this asap. Otherwise, for ease of use, a great app"
"Loved the old app for tracking trends in weight, BP, pulse but not now. I also dislike that Samsung is demanding to store the data. Unless this is changed, I'll be searching for another tracker and/or app."
"The interface is great, but the pulse is always lower than reality and it doesn't track my runs very well (on S7). Makes me trust the data less."
"I have used SHealth for years. The latest update has removed major tools that I use every day: 1) The ave HR is not displayed & individual categories (e.g., resting, after exercise) are displayed togehter w/ no way to see each indiv. category. I use the HR tool to track my real-time HR to hit my cardio goals. I have to export my data to an excel sheet then calculate the ave myself AFTER my workout. 2) Macros no longer displayed in grams, only kCal. Snacks are one category, bad for diabetics."
Please share! I've been on the phone with Samsung 2 and a half hours. My S3 Gear Frontier was sent in last week for repair. I went to bed and put it on charge. When I got up it was no longer working. I got a answer back by email from Samsung repair saying it had got moisture inside so my warranty was void. They sent me a bill for 339.91 to repair my watch. The representative told me that moisture could get in through the backside of the watch at the spot that monitor your heart rate that it
"The latest upgrade downgraded my experience, I can only log 4 meals instead of 6. I see I am not the only here who has been driven mad by this ""upgrade"". Please don't tell me to use my airtime to call a number my service provider doesn't recognise, the number simply doesn't dial! So very very irritated!"
This helps me to see that I barely get deep sleep. I'm stuck in between light sleep and awake. This information shows my Sleep doctor if I need to change the way I sleep. This is very detailed and a huge help. Thanks.
"update problem solved thank you!! this is my go to app. 4.25.2019 is anyone else experiencing problem with app? When I try to open it, it shows a message for your safety we are unable to open app. I use this app daily help!!! How do I fix it ?"
"Keeps opening every 5 seconds and saying it can't open on a rooted phone. Well, my phone isn't rooted. If I could give less than 1 star now, I would since this unable to open screen pops up literally every 5 seconds. This only started after the new update this morning."
"*upped rating, recent update its performing better now* I have used this app for 2 years, the last couple of updates, navigation through the app is incredibly slow. 4-5 second delays between touching something and it reacting."
I'm using galaxy fit and the app to track my work out and nutrition. I'm giving 2 stars bc 1.does not record actual duration of work out.2. Food variety that I can track is too limited compare to other app that I've used before. 3. Break down of consumed food calculation is different.ex) nutrition bar indicated that I consumed 26g of protein but break down indicated that I consumed only 16g. 4. The app is not user friendly over all. I really like how it's tracking my sleeping pattern though...
I really liked this app until their recent update tried to force me to allow phone permissions to even open the app. This is really an overreaching incursion into my privacy and I'm unsure of how having access to my phone and contacts allows samsung to more accurately track my daily step count? I immediately deleted the app and I will think long and hard about purchasing another Samsung product.
"Thru the updates it has become less useful to me. This last update made tracking weight pointless. It's only a line graph, it doesn't compare weights at all. What would contacting them do?"
Really loved this app and used it every day. Until they removed one of the main features The weight management part. i am so annoyed that this has been removed. And after loads of bad feedback they have received from the community.we get the same answer but no update of it returning.
was FANTASTIC..until they removed the alarm/vibrate function..telling you when a reading was finished... without that..i have almost zero use for the app...turning phone over to SEE IF READING is finished..makes it start again....what a STUPID decision to remove that..
Can't Live Without It! I've recorded and tracked my activity and food; used the Weight Management section to lose 9kg so far and there is a great choice of free activities available at different skill levels. I'm always recommending Samsung Health!
"I can't connect to strava. It used to sync, but now it doesn't for no reason. Secondly, I can't connect my MI smart composition scale. Samsung contact us does not help."
"I have been using Samsung health app as a tracker to sync with Singtel apps to record the steps. Suddenly, this apps could not locate Singtel apps to give permission to sync the tracker. Please advise. Thanks"
Unable to set up. Keeps prompting for 2 factor verification but if you use the computer to set up a password it won't acknowledge that it's been set up and if you go through the app it won't let you select the button to set up the password
"My app isn't counting my steps right anymore. I've been walking the same as I always do and it says I've only walked a mile when I've had to of walked over 5. My steps aren't paused, I've tried walking differently, and carrying my phone differently but it's still not counting my steps like it used too."
"Used to be better, when I press on ""History, I used to get an image of the rout I walked beside all other information. Now all I get is a graph showing my speed and my heart rate, no image."
Keeps updating and I lose all my tracked info. Ridiculous. Can't keep up with anything this way. All progress never recorded. Even when connected with the gear s3 watch.
"Use to love this app. What ever you do, DON'T UPDATE. I updated and now it can't find me and all my info is gone. Created a new account and it still continues to not work properly. Why do you need access to my photos. No thanks. Installed, looking for something else. I loved it before the update."
"Very clunky, I got stuck in some circle trying to set up dual verification. After trying to set it up five times in a row and going in a circle I uninstalled the app totally worthless."
"I enjoyed this app until I got a new fitness tracker, can't upload any of my data with it. But my Samsung watch had to be charged way too frequently, so now I'm stuck. Hate that I can't sync my fitness info"
"Today I returned to using Samsung Health with my new Active Watch, I was shocked to still not see a bar code reader in the food part of the app. Sadly the app lets the watch down more so in such a time where people have such busy lifes. Old Review Below I use my Gear phone and watch every day, however it would be good to see some form of a disability section, im under my target but this is due to having spinal problems and arthritis in hips and arm."
"Completly useless to me now i can'nt measure my stress and heartbeat and now even the step counter does'nt work properly. Thanks Samsung for ruining a perfectly good app. Bravo! üëèüëèüëèüëèüëè Update: You can jog on if you think i'm calling an international number coz you keep screwing the app up by removing usefull features that NO ONE asked you to remove! Been supporting samung since the Galaxy S2, now on Galaxy S20. Will No Longer support you now as you don't value your customers!!!"
"Used to be the app for tracking my runs, I have suddenly gained 3-5 mins on every run! What would be 1k marker has now turned to many different places and so unaccurate. Gutting as I used to like this app"
I really enjoy using this app because it connects with Discovery so I can get my vitality points. But this morning I woke up and all my data for the past two months is gone‚òπÔ∏è I don't understand how this happened..
"I installed on lg g4 and it justs has the circle in the loginpage after logging in. I was planning on buying samsung galaxy smartwatch and that was the reason i downloaded. If you dont support my phone, then what makes you think that it is ok to waste my time waiting for the circle to finally end????? Disgraceful corporate torture. And why cant i change my country since i relocated in the recent 10 years..... .. .... Edit to response: i live in uk. why do i have to make an international call???"
"Great app. Would be even better if it could calculate kilojoules rather than calories. Shift work sleep rotations. Or could edit automatically entered data I.e edit calculated sleep times, exercise etc..."
"Still the same, after deleting the cache it still doesn't count the steps properly. It just ignores more than HALF of my steps. I have an s8 with gear sport..before in together..i used to be on top 2% now i cant even get past top 5% or 7%.."
My Galaxy Active is showing too much calories burnt. Like 2000 at 8am already. I realize it's not the app problem (or is it?) but the issue makes the whole health tracking and monitoring experience worthless.
"My experience with Samsung health on my earlier Samsung Galaxy mobile was good but on my new one plus 6 T it's worst than ever , everytime when i start walking it's doesn't track on it's own , i have to start app which was not the case with my earlier samsung mobile that means it doesn't work properly with other Brand's mobile. That's why 3 stars."
Good app....would be a 5 star review If there was a barcode scanner on the food tracker. I like to track ingredients that I use and it would make it a lot easier to track if I could scan the food with my phone.
Worked until this morning then suddenly wants additional permissions like contacts. Not happening. User optimal experience is not an answer. You have no right to force access to contacts or phone. Fix it or I'll be living to an iPhone and watch.
"I can't even use the app anymore. The 2 step verification won't even proceed. It says bad gateway or just spins forever and freezes. It was the only fitness app I used, and now it's just garbage."
"It's a gr8 app n all, I recommend you should download it. But Samsung can make some changes like- 1. The change of themes and colors. 2. Things like heart points like Google fit has so that it's more challenging."
I use to love this app for the pulse oxidation. I have asthma this app would help me keep track of the oxygen levels. I showed it to my asthma doctors they were impressed now the oxidation app is no long on the list so I disabled the app very disappointed. I have been a Samsung customer over fifteen years my whole family why was there not an alert sent to the customers. Unsatisfied customer
"You say to contact you via the app via >Settings>contact You obviously don't know your own product, on my Samsung 10 which the app updated this morning there IS NO SETTINGS TAB, AND NO AREA THAT ALLOWS CONTACT WITH YOU. You have messed with this once great app, which is one of the reasons I stayed with Android, phone is due for renewal and Apple is looking to be a better proposition. Been a Samsung customer for 18 years, updated every 2 years. The app is hard to use now"
"This app helps me motivate myself to do daily exercise. Although I would do it anyway, it helps me by measuring what I am doing. As someone who tries to do too many things, using a categorized tool focuses me on the moment. I like it."
Ok but 2 many ads. Would be nice to have it sync with Google fit. The gear app is terrible with caps and very touchy. Was considering buying another watch but I'll wait several years before I do.
"I loved the older app. I did an update this morning, and the update seems to be missing the healthy pace steps that was embedded in the overall steps. This has been my primary step tracker, and is my favorite app. How do I go back to the old app without losing my history?"
"Pretty great, but the stress breathing function shows no results after completion. That was one of the new features I'd hope would work with my s10+ and galaxy watch 2 active."
"I was nearing the end of a challenge with a friend that I thought would be close and it deducted 15,000 steps from my side in the last minutes. I lost!! Step counter could use some work. I may uninstall the app."
"1. It is possible to get free XP by creating 20 public invitation challanges, inviting nobody, and letting them expire whilst keeping the invitation XP. 2. Now that challanges have a specified start date they regularly auto-cancel if not accepted before the start date. This is tedious. 3. Both can be solved by removing the auto-cancel feature and just pushing dates back by one day if the challange isn't accepted in time. Unused public challanges would then also be limited to 20"
"Update: I set up Samsung pay on my phone and I had to do 2FA on there. That magically fixed the health app. Glad it's working now. App asks for 2FA setup. It never goes through even after I enter the code I received. I even went on my computer to setup 2FA in my Samsung account, which should have translated to this app as I was using the same Samsung account. No luck. Now I cannot get my daily steps and other day from my active 2 onto my phone."
A great app and very useful. But irritating when suddenly thousands of your steps not recorded!! Incomplete data makes it diffcult to monitor your activity.
"Was great for a pre-installed health app, but just updated and lost too many features. Where is the ""healthy pace"" section? I walk around a lot so I don't pay attention to total daily steps and really liked the automatic tracking of my ""walking with a purpose"" steps."
"I like the challenges and the information it shows, such as how active you are compared to other users, activity and heart rate, although it would be better if the heart rate was shown how this varied and affected sleep. Great app though!"
"Terrible app. The upgrade doesn't include anything that I had access to before. Heart rate, oxygen level, etc. Not buying the watch. If I could give zero stars I would."
I started using the app in oct 2019 and its crashed 2 times already the step count wont increase... I waited for 3 days each time for it to revive and then reinstalled it... why does this happen...also after raising the issue no one comes back... not very motivating üòî
"Sp02 function is gone after last update and only available in stress tracker. Not everyone wants to wait for a ""stress tracker"" measurement. Luckily I had the apk for the previous version and will hold off on updating."
"Privacy issues. I used this app all the time until recently when it asked for access to my contacts. Why would they need this? I fail to see how having access to my contacts would improve the apps efficiency. So no way, not using it anymore"
"Very good for steps and cardio, also excellent that it has Spotify on the watch. Horrible for strength training. I'm not checking my watch in-between each set, that's dumb."
"Great App that got crippled after last update. The Weight Management function was phenomenal, removing that feature renders the app useless to me and many others. Please consider readding the functionality with another update."
"I really like most trackers on here, they're easy to navigate and understand, but the step counter doesn't work at all. For example, today I walked 8,967 steps (I have another step counter) and on Samsung health it says I walked 81. Please fix this so that I don't need 2 different apps"
Horrible experience with running coach. Can't customize any exercises or paces even though it has the option to. That part of the program never saves the exercise
Yeah. It was hard to find the comments section for this app for some reason? I'm just trying to use this app like everyone else. And you guessed it. In the loop trying to verify my password to my fancy two step verification. Just fix it please. I been so happy with this app before. I haven't been able to use it for about a month now
"I don't want to get a Samsung account just to read and use my health data on my phone. Need an account for backing up data, fine, but make backup optional. Requiring a Samsung account and my IMEI is just blatant personal data mining."
The app after years of use suddenly demands permission to make and receive calls at look at my internet usage. This is supposed to be a health app. Avoid it if you like your privacy. Not s good sign from samsung and why i will be looking at other brands in the future. I used to trust samsung but not anymore.
"What happened to stress manager. On note 10, seems like it's nowhere to be found plus heart rate and o2 are supposed to be combined inside so without starts making the app a bit worthless :( edit: again stress is not showing as available at all in health now"
"The new update made everything worse. The functionality changed, don't like the graphics. Its not as user friendly as the previous. Change it back."
It would be good to change the target monthly steps and look back on achievements over the year more readily. Such as a daily average for the year.
"Used to be able to sync from watch only but this option has now been removed, why?? Would have given 5 otherwise. Looked in settings and no reference as to selecting Galaxy sport watch as default tracker."
"When I purchased my $1000 + samsung phone I paid for the stock software, why on earth are there ads in the app? This is disgraceful, I never signed up to having Terry White's Eating Disorder Bars shoved in my face every time I opened the app. If these ads are not removed I'll be swapping my galaxy watch and phone for the Apple Variety. You can't have no ads for like what 4 years then just smash them in there"
BROKEN APP... Community features like message notifications quit working a couple months ago and the developers have not fixed the issue. Lost a lot of exercise friends... the app has been a negative in my life since..
Oh my god!!! Where the hell did the most important feature go? üò±I can no longer see my remaining calories nor see how much I need to workout on the day. WHY WOULD THE APP DELETE THAT? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüò°ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èI have stopped using the app since the feature disappeared and have put on weight üò°ü§¨how long does it take to bring back the feature you removed?
The app has very poor step recording which needs to be fixed immediately. I tend to walk roughly 5 miles to and from work and yet it barely records the proper number of steps for something like that.
"Just bought a Samsung 20 5g and an active 2 LTE watch. As an upgrade from my s8. After spending $2000 on 2 new Samsung products today I can't even activate the weight management part of the Samsung health app. I layed out all this cash to help myself lose 50kg,and you've removed the best function of the health app! Bloody disgraceful! Wouldn't mind being the loose change that rattles round in your pockets."
"Really disappointed, app now won't open without permission to contacts just brought a watch and scales that link with it, I won't give the permission didn't need it before and app worked fine, why now? Will uninstall app, find another to use, see I'm not the only person unhappy with this change."
"Decent app for health and exercise, my only gripe is the food tracker. My Fitness Pal has a better way of tracking macros and an easier way to find specific foods, I just refuse to pay for that app."
"My steps history was not recovered after intentionally resetting my S9+ due to Pie update. Lost a lot of tracking data. I am very disapointed. Please, increase your recovey scenarios (if any) when performing regression testing."
"Overall good but no way to change to UK settings? I like this app but my girlfriend had hers preinstalled on her S10 and it has all UK brands for food. However I have it for my pixel and it is all American brands I have never heard of which makes it a lot harder to log acurattely, and I can't see anyway to change this...."
"I just downloaded the app and it just keeps loading and loading... it can't start, it can't skip. downloaded previous version, downloaded from playstore, downloaded from galaxy store still the same problem... please fix"
"You removed measuring SpO2. Very useful feature even though it may be not very accurate, but very consistent. The last version which supported this feature was 6.4.0.047 or so."
"These missing stars are pissing me off. I accepted the Igloo Challenge when it opened end of Dec. I check my progress regularly. I verify steps needed a day or two before, and make sure I hit the count BEFORE midnight. I still don't get the stars. I checked yesterday evening and needed 400 steps. When I went to bed, I had 101,206 steps according to the app. 151 of those were after midnight, meaning I was 1,000+ steps more than needed for the damned star... no star was given. SAMSUNG FAIL."
"With the updates, the Oxygen saturation measurement has been removed as a single option and merged with the stress measurement, BRING BACK SpO2 separate reading! It's a great app, but with these updates, I rather revert to the stock app and uninstall the updates."
"Your app was so much before. Since you updated this oxygen program it's awful. Doesn't give you an average, doesn't give you time oxy is taken and there are no numbers on the graph. So it's anyone's guess as to what their graphs reads."
"Very Useful app for fitness as it gives many features of daily workout tracking. With help of this app, I improve my health and manage weight. I recommend this app to those who want to lose or maintain weight and live healthy life."
Very sad ... During this pandemic I was often monitor my blood oxygen saturation with this app. This two step verification ruined everything. The developers could opt it only for people who want that hifi security. I really don't want two step verification.
This app helped me lose 50+ lbs. Loved the calorie deficit meter. Now it's gone. Some people are motivated by visual cues such as that meter. Bring it back!
"They just keep adding in more ads and recommendations to the app, instead of fixing things like the delay with syncing to galaxy wearables or adding features like syncing to other fitness trackers."
I like how this app connect to other fitness apps and take your steps into account with the auto function when you go for a run or take a hike. Also the auto function for cycling is good. Would like to see an seprate activity for a full weight training session. This app works well with the samsung gear fit 2 pro and samsung androids. If samsung could design a heart rate braclets accurate enough for weight training it would be cool thoughüí™
"02 oxygen tracker is gone. how do I get back my oxygen data for my doctor's appointment? no warning all my daily oxygen records are gone. the new app is terrible. cannot count on saved data to be there, Samsung just removed it all. Do not trust Samsung apps. Kim K thank you for your unsatisfactory reply reply. i reinstalled older version. customer satisfaction is obviously not your goal. your new set up with stress etc. is not what I want. version .47 is what i want."
"Does not sync with my galaxy fit accurately my band says 16,348 steps samsung health reading 12,000 steps while one hour before it read 15,998 steps. Where did the steps go?? Aggravating since this is used with my Virgin pulse thru work for wellbeing. It stopped syncing at 4pm. Thinking about switching to fitbit"
I have used it for about 2 years and recently have uninstalled it countless time that for no reason every 3 minutes it would randomly crash and some how end up lagging my own to the point if my phone was switched off it wouldn't even let me in to my phone
Lifesaver. My last resort to lose weight. I have tried everything. I also love the nutritional information that helps me to monitor what I need to eat or avoid for good health.
"I am so annoyed. After installing the new update, I can't log in anymore. Seriously I've tried everything, unintalling, clearing cache and clearing data, switching the phone on and off.This is so frustrating üò§"
Wow! So many negative reviews for the very latest update 2 stage authentication & permissions fiasco. Samsung writes the guide on how to take down & ruin a brilliant Health App (and its their own App!) Good job I turned off auto-updates to save what remained after Samsungs March update screw-up. (Downloaded a separate free Weight tracking App which by the way is excellent.)
"Even after the Galaxy Watch update and this update, the treadmill app still doesn't work. I spent almost an hour chatting with a rep a few weeks ago. My Galaxy Watch 2 worked amazing for runs on the treadmill up until about last fall when they changed something in the software. I bought a Galaxy Active 4 thinking it would help. I think I will just go back to FitBit, since you can adjust your stride length. Samsung Health works well for outdoor runs with GPS but treadmill app a total joke."
It's a good app and I wish I could use it properly but it doesnt connect to my watch. Be great if it connect to all kinds of watches as I dont want to waste money buying a new samsung watch when I have one that works fine I just use a different app
"I have used this app for over 5 years and now it wants access to my phone call data???? Even if it stays within the app which I doubt, I think we are due more detailed explanation of why this kind of access is specifically required now. Lame, I will not use until they update to remove this permission I have been waiting for an excuse to stop using this app and use a pro excercise app anyways, goodbye Samsung bloatware."
"This is a good app and does what it needs to do; however, I feel uncomfortable having to change my permissions so it has access to my phone calls and camera. Without those permissions the app wouldn't work."
"There are discrepancies when syncing workouts to Strava. There are forums all over the internet about this. When is Samsung going to fix this issue as it means all Samsung watch owners can't post to other platforms accurately. You're causing a siloed ecosystem so next hardware watch purchase will be a Garmin or a Suntoo. No integrations with Strava (that are accurate), Training Peaks etc etc. Can't even buy your next gen watch cos the problem is at server / API Level."
"It was a 5 start app until Samsung changed the app. I loved it when you could check oxygen levels, stress levels, heart rate and so much more. Now I don't even use it. It's useless in my opinion"
"Absolutely don't know what I would do without this app!! Tracks my sleep, my steps, my exercise routine and yoga. And I can input my food, I can take my heart rate and stress level i know I'm forgetting things. It's so amazing! I wish I could give it 10 stars"
Have all permissions turned on and still won't let me pass the agreement screen. Developer replied stating permissions need to be on. But they are all on and have been the whole time. Still will not let me use the app.
App has deleted the option to show steps count only via watch which is very awkward. Now my mobile shows steps by both Phone+Watch. Hence they overlap the steps. Needs to see only watch steps both in Cell Phone & Watch Face. please help.
"Following reinstalling all seems to be ok. Update: stopped working again. I do not wish to spend money phoning a US number from the UK, can you provide UK support as the app is all but useless on Android 10. And now Android 12 same issues."
"The app is great except for the challenges for walking each month, the top people in this challenge are all obviously cheating, and it is a bit disheartening to see nothing done about it."
"With the latest update I can't access the app without allowing it to manage phone calls, and I can't access any challenge without giving access to my contacts. The only reason I keep using the app is the fact that I own a Samsung smart watch which I now officially regret."
App is great tool for tracking... you need to add TEMPERATURE! With Covid-19 in our lives we need to manual track our body temperature. If it could be done by touching sensor that would be fantastic!
"this update sucks! they updated the privacy policy and unless I agree to let Samsung health ""make and manage phone calls"", I can't use the app. you don't need to have access to that, this is a health app, I don't use this app to communicate with people."
"I am unable to sign in or sign up. The furthest i can get is to do the i have read and understand the terms and conditions check boxes. It then thinks for hours and tells me there is not a strong enough connection, despite my unlimited Wi-Fi. Can anyone help?"
It's forcing me to access my contact and phone call details.. why? Also it's forcing me to do 2 factor authentication and if i deny it's giving me error
"Forces us to activate 2fa and give permission to our contacts ,with out which it won't work. Absolutely pathetic."
Doesn't show sleep cycle. I tried reinstall the application but not resolved this issue.
The Heart Beat monitor does not have a button to start recording my heartbeat. I have a S22 ultra.
"I love Samsung Health! It helps me count my steps at work with my phone in my pocket or with my Samsung watch. i never realized how many steps I take or took every day. This app also helps blood pressure, heart rate, weight, and more. it helps me pay attention to things I never have before."
I was using this app on my previous Samsung models. I tried on my a12 model it is not working what could be the problem kindly help I need the app
Not sure why but it no longer shows stages of sleep. Please fix this!
After cell fone software update its not working properly. Its stops automatically
Love the app but it would be so much better where you rename or create your own workouts
Add the ability to manually edit workouts logged in from a watch!!! I keep forgetting to stop the workout and end up having to delete the workout instead of just editing it in app to be shorter! The reply to my review is silly - why would I call support out of country about a feature we have been begging for for years ?
I can't understand why we need to install 3 different apps just for using smartwatch to it's full potential
"works with my watch fine, used to have connection issues but keep updating to fix the bugs"
"I upgraded my phone and now it no longer has the STRESS Measure, blood-oxygen level Measure, Heart rate measure... Why were these features discontinued?"
I have a gear fit2 pro and this app will not work with my watch anymore. Please fix
Bug on either the watch or phone app prevents average pace from being calculated.
Would love this app to work on my Galaxy Tab so I have the larger screen to view workouts on.
why do you allow cheats every single day on your app? the top 20 to 30 would be physically impossible to gain that amount of steps EVERY SINGLE DAY. my only competition is me but is beyond ridiculous how these people get up to 200.000 steps a day every single day. unless all they do is literally walk 24/7 and 30 days a month. why are you allowing this to happen?
"Sometimes not working, background has to work, show the map also."
"As you promised, after latest update Sleep Recording definitely improved. Thank you."
App looks cool and works well but the method to enter foods need a lot of work
"In auth window lies about supported browsers - won't work in firefox, trivks you to install their spyware browser."
I used to be able to use my phone to do pulse and oxygen levels and now this doesn't seem to be available any more
"Far too basic. I wish LG was still dropping phones, health app was way better."
Step counting stops for no apparent reason. Needs phone to be restarted.
"2FA is ridiculous, even more so than the idea that someone would want to look me up through the app using my phone number."
I can't open the app after the last update with 2 steps notification....
Doesn't work without a permission to manage phone calls.
What happened to the ecg on the app? One of the main reasons I got the watch was so I could monitor and record my heart for the doctor...and its frigging GONE!!! WHY!?!?
"Works great. Please change the icon, I only see a duck."
"Bug - Updated ""targets"" are not reflected in the Daily Activity view."
22/01/2022 - This even counts when I'm traveling by bus... so unreliable... 02/12/2022 - Still the same...
"Since a week or something, walking burns about twice as many calories according to the app."
"Was happy with this app. However, now I cannot even use because I had to update. Now it wants permission to all sorts of things on my phone. I accepted and then it would not install. Very disappointing. Keep saying accept permission in settings."
Body composition portlet is not getting updated with latest measurements.
"It's giving error,I don't know why but it's not working.it says can't set up app."
Can we have more blood glucose monitor support? I've gone from using a TEE2+ which auto recorded my results in Samsung Health to now using a Contour Next One Meter which doesn't work now
"Good, not great... Needs barcode scanning for calorie counting"
"Food database feels like advertising for food. Also, carbs recommended daily intake is 55%? that's ridiculously UNhealthy!"
"Since the update, phone and watch are double counting steps.."
"Works amazing and is really fun, but I'm fairly sure the leaderboard gets messed up by people who have step machines attached to a phone. Cuz the step counts on day 1 are nearly impossible from normal walking."
It requires that you give it access to your contacts. Not optional.
It was great but after updating the app i can't verify and code isn't sent.
The best app in store perfectly - running time & distance show sleeping countly & walking step count very heart beat thanks for Samsung health team app
"Sometimes it miss the stepcount,beside this it is good app for health management."
"It does not have blood pressure monitoring app, the main reason for which I bought the Samsung Galaxy watch 5."
After my watch updated recently the ECG recorder causes my watch to lock itself everytime after the recording is completed.
Can you please fix the error. The app refuses to open. Error 0x2C#-1#
My mobile app which is up to date but it is not updating my steps but my watch is working fine samsung note 20 5g
Recently I found that time is not properly calculated..Instead 40 min the app shown as 17min..Disappointed :(
Used to be good but rubbish now! Won't let me add my partner who uses the app on his iPhone absolutely bull! Gues have to find another app. Get it together samsung!
Heart rate from my fit watch doesn't sync with cycling anymore. How to fix
Very good but would be so much better with barcode scanner for foods
"Good app, but I'd like to be able to sync my steps to Google's Health Connect. I see currently I am able to sync various data types, but not steps. Are there any plans to implement this?"
App is totally confused about date after clock change from summer time.
The latest update is not auto detecting the work out.
"Your app doesn't let me use it just because I don't have a Sim card which doesn't make any sense üò°, Please fix it üôè."
"The app is keep stoping... I use Samsung A51, after last update, the app is keep stoping... What should i do?"
Syncing wiith Strava is not stable. Download with GPX has been removed. Bad UX
It will go days without tracking my steps and then all of a sudden it will decide it wants to start again. After following their instructions it still fails to record steps. This app is terrible.
It doesn't support any other watches except Samsung. I use an android phone because it doesn't have restrictions such as the iPhone has. So this app is useless because of this. Have to use Google fit. Update: you're offering me to make an international phone call? For what?
Good app would be better if there was a widget for daily activity and not just steps
Keeps telling me my session has expired. Very annoying.
"Use this every day, but have to have a nutrition app to look up foods to record"
Weekly summary won't update. Mine is still on 10/16-10/22 as of 11/7.
"What the hell is wrong with Samsung? Their health app is no longer compatible with Note 20 Ultra. I mean the sensors for heart rate and stress measurement. Lame. However, I will not buy a samsung watch, and my next phone will not be samsung, for sure."
"Unable to open app, trying since last 15 days. Very poor"
The apps for checking BP and stress won't update to current date and when I try to use Bixby I get a message that says app has stopped running but it doesn't reconnect. I am able to use samsung health to full advantage .
Samsung has the crappiest apps! This is exactly why Apple is winning! I have to switch over to Apple!!!
"Can't use it without handing over your phone number, which Samsung will use to publish your information"
"At first I thought this was an actual ""phone health""app,after the first time it showed me my daily progress report,I was in love and super impressed with the ease and accuracy and actual information. I very nearly forget it's even running until my daily report pops up. So. Love. It."
After transfering to new phone the stress recorder doesn't work.
Has been working well but stopped at 1 November 2022 and will not record any new weight
My app keeps telling me cant connect get a good network yet am in a 10mbps wifi network.
Now today my 3 workoare just repeatedly adding to my calories burned like 3 to 10 times. As quias I delete they co e back double or triple . Says I burned 19 thousand plus today so far.
It would be better if they would reminder to drink water instead of daily consumption.
"A better widget would be cool, the actual one is ugly and so boring ..."
Recent upgrade asking for access to calls is ridiculous... I'm out and will be selling my galaxy watch. I'll get a fit bit. Or maybe Huawei as my wife has one and it's superb for the price .... as I can't respond to your response. I understand your reason. But this wasn't needed previously. I guess like many who are now giving low reviews or not even reviewing I'll not give such permissions regardless. I'll just stop using and move. My watch will be on ebay next week. User feedback??!!
Bundle app unable to add xiaomi mi body measurement scale after trying several throughout the month
I don't understand why to use pulse oximeter it needs to access my contacts and my photos
Since this last update all of my steps history is gone. I need this back for my tracking!
I have a pixel 7 pro and I can't connect it with my galaxy watch 5 pro. How do I fix it.
"Earlier we could calculate stress level and blood oxygen level , not it is stopped"
Still having to reconnect Strava all the time. Irritating!
Terrible. Will not open. Constant problems.
I use and like the app but wont let me share stats with another app or my smart watch and their tallys differ
"Syncing with other apps is either impossible or annoying. Which is a problem because many health insurance give money for syncing your steps but samsung health syncs with nothing useful, it makes you regret buying samsung devices :("
Used to work... Now sleep times off by 6 hours and twice texted for help with zero response
New update removed Caffeine intake. Also edit sleep wake up time not working.
Samsung health app is very excellent it motivated me to do health actvities but now facing problem on using android 12. Please let me know how to fix bug
Its not a bank or something why do you have to make registering process so difficult?! 2FA and back up codes what is that? Why would this app need that? I had an account before and I was not able to login in to it anymore since ive changed my phone number and dont have access to the old one. Make it simple. Again Its not a bank account.
"I haven't even signed in and already can give 1 star. To sign in, I need to use samsung browser, really?"
A well designed app that is easy to use and gives me information that I find valuable. The monthly challenges would be better if they block/prevent cheating.
After phone updated the app keeps crashing!!!!
App.not working now. Initially for 20 days app working fine.
"I can track my water, food and so much,I can even track my 3 mile walk, Monday- Friday. I love it."
Stopped sleep tracking after yesterdays update. Please fix asap!
generally ok but now way to use phone for heart rate monitoring.
Sharing feature won't allow you to upload your own photos from gallery
Not sure how to change the background when sharing my workout. I get an icon of a woman with a backpack.
Works but launches my browser and the app automatically every 12am. Why?
"No longer allows me to enter my weight. Was a good app, but is now broken"
Good enough in general. Great if you also have a smartwatch :)
I get well above my goal of steps everyday. When I get week review it says 'You reached you goal one day this week!!!! I'm sick of it. It use to work very well. But this has been going on for many months now. I email them and they never get back with me!!!
Isn't working correctly.. its syncing but still showing different information in the app vs my galaxy watch 4. Sync time updates but not information. Also not syncing my workouts. Tried everything I could find online to no avail.
"Can be made better 1. The app should have feature to show the total number of steps/calories burnt/activity time taken till date 2. In the ""together feature"" the activity compares with friends is only for 7 days, it should show for either weeks or months, as the user wishes The developer should take more cues from apps like strava and pacer (both available on play store)"
"Absolute brilliant step counter and trace and tracking information, proof of your journey plus calories information. Keeps you up to date in health and leisure fitness ability. Just perfect."
I enjoy tracking my steps. I did have a problem with Samsung health app. It was uninstalled and re installed on my previous phone twice. Now that I have another new phone it seems to be working much better.
Thank you for making the app less usable. I bought Watch 4 and upgraded to new app. Somehow it's tracking stress level but not heart rate anymore. One can only call for support instead of leaving a message and getting a reply. This is BAD. I wish there's a 0 star option.
"I would like to share my route but it shows milestones only without a map. Why would I share just a ""line with milestones""? I want to share/show where I was running/biking/... If anyone knows how to enable a map, please help - if not possible to show the map, add it to the app."
"It was working well; however, it did not work after the last update; it requests to sign in, but it does not sign in; even creating new account did not work. I have uninstalled it, and trying to reinstall it and see."
"It tracks my walking and food, stress. I really like it. Update - wish you didnt get rid of the O2 stat level that you can do separately. That is important, so I took a star away."
"What was once a fantastic app, it's now a huge privacy violator asking to manage my phone calls. There's absolutely no reason any company should have access to that. It's a shame because the app is so good. Ill go back to using Excel documents and managing it that way."
"Don't get this app if you don't want people to be able to find your account by your phone number. Couldn't find an opt out option so asked them directly how to opt out and they said they need the phone number for 2FA and didn't address how to opt out of people looking you up by phone number, so I guess you can't. Edit: Your response confirms the phone number is used for people to find you, like the app says it does (settings >phone number) and that it's not possible to opt out. That's unsafe."
"No matter how much I try, the calories burnt shows the exact same count every time for 30 mins. Even is I do a heavyweight workout or a light workout, the count for 30 mins is same. This is very frustrating for such an expensive watch. Please give a solution for this."
"Following recent update a Notification was downloaded to the ""For You"" folder in the pulldown menu. Attempts to open the folder causes the app the crash. Restarting the app does not fix the problem."
"Amazing! I Just Love This App! I Have Been Using This For Less Than A Month And It Has Not Only Made Me Realize My Fitness But Also Improve It To A Great Extent! I currently use this along with YAZIO to track nutrition. If Samsung Health had better nutritional tracking, I would definitely use this standalone. One More Thing Is The Design Of The Heart Rate Trends. If This Showed The Heart Rate Throughout The Day In ECG-Like Design, then it would be great. But Still Hats-Off To The Developers."
"I have been monitoring my diabetes through this app, and it is quite easy to use. It would be great if I could add the meals(What I ate throughout the day) so that I have it all in one place, rather than writing it elsewhere."
Health Monitor? What's up with the Samsung Health Monitor app in Ireland? It's not available? Big disappointment. The Samsung Health app is OK. I'd honestly optimise the UI in order to show more info where needed. EDIT 07/09/2021: I contacted support. There's no solution as of yet.
"Great app but has such potential to take things to the next level. Blood glucose monitoring and thyroid monitoring would be an amazing addition via a smart watch, we just need the tech."
Good so far but could be better. Would love to be able to have a favorites list for work outs or even a build your own circuit feature. Join with social media to have more friends in challenges.
No web interface. Workout history is hard to use. Graphs and charts are not comfortable for viewing. Lack of non samsung smartwatches support. Only can see history of 30 days. Disappointing...
Love the app but can u update the food intake part. where we could scan the bar codes of items to add. It would be so much easier and not as time consuming.
"I like this app. Perfect companion for my Watch Active 2. However, I wish it would give total steps for the entire week instead of just average steps taken. It used to do that in previous versions. Don't understand why that was removed"
like many others i loved this app until this new update. cannot access the app without allowing samsung to access and manage phone calls... are you serious?? what possible reason could a step counting app have to make phone calls? i truly don't understand why apps these days just randomly decide to implement features that users hate for no apparent reason. i should have a choice in not giving access to my calls. please fix this.
"Couldn't log in!!! Far to much pissing about for a FITNESS APP keeps telling me to use another device, wrong phone no, do this do that, blah blah blah!!! Complete waste of my time!!! It's a fitness app FFSüò° I have am account but can't get in!!!! Absolutely pointless!!!!"
"got rid of the weight management way to difficult to understand and was giving me 2 different calorie amounts should just be able to have a calculator with bmr and tdee figures,then set your own calorie bar ,makes life easier instead of numbers all over the place in this app."
"This app is great and easy to use. The only thing that could make it 5 stars (for me) is to have a food scanner to make log in of meals easier. But overall, a great, multi-functional health app"
"The first time I used this app, it told me I slept consistently for 7.5 hours instead of showing me a sleep pattern. I woke up at 2am to let the dog out, but it did not show that. Not an accurate app. Not sure if I'm using the right for my S2 gear"
This app is AMAZING. and friends can challenge u for example a step challenge for who gets the goal steps first! The food is easy and the workouts are AMAZING. I CANNOT IMAGINE HOW UNHEALTHY I WOULD BE WITHOUT IT!!!
Update doesnt allow seperate recording and saving of says. It is now under stress but doesnt save oxygen sats so you can't keep a track now. Not very helpful if you have health worries and wanted to keep a record.
used to like this app till latest updates... why an app needs to have any permissions to my phone is beyond a breach of privacy /trust. I have also read the feedback on this from the app and your assurances absolutely DON'T cut it! I have uninstalled this app and will never reinstall it until that level of permission is removed. If I could give 0 stars I would.
"Hi the app need few updates like cycling challenge, share entire cycling report instead of a chart. For the base map Google maps are preferred instead of a photo.. Little workaround is definitely needed"
"Hi, i just changed device, installed all needed apps and plugins to pair it up with my gear fit 2pro, but Samsung health just won't start. After email and password i accept permissions and it starts never ending loading screen..."
The app was good before update. It used to work with my gear frontier s3 on any device. Now it does not work at all. I cannot get it to work. Stuck at welcome screen. No way to get my gear s3 to work anymore. Samsumg 'bots' humans or not.. Pls. do not suggest to call customer care number in US. I do not wish to spend even a single penny more on your product or services...as i have bought so many products (expensive ones also) since galaxy s1 but never quite got value for money beyond first few month unlike apple or google or amazon products...if you are really serious about improving customer satisafaction invest more time in testing and research before launch...
Love the app but since its been moved to my new phone I can't pull down on ybe notification bar and have it always there. I have checked the settings and my phone settings so I dont know why this is happening. Would give 5 stars when this is fixed.
"Challenges are HORRIBLE. Not intuitive in where to push buttons, not able to find friends easily. Gives you good stats but not what those stats actually mean."
"Very good for everything health-related. I would improve the trainings, which I really like. It could be good to have a better training program browsing/filtering."
"It's constantly shutting my apps down, saying that Samsung Health is not responding. It's making my phone super slow. But i believe I need this app to run some of my programs. I don't thing they will work without it. ."
"Not good, will not work on phones purchased from Thailand ie note 20"
"I just updated the app and it keeps trying to open, even without selecting the app, and gives me an error message. I uninstalled and then installed again and keeps happening."
"UPDATED - with a recent update, the issue has been resolved and the app is syncing perfectly with Samsung Health. I am looking forward to trying it out with a Galaxy Watch 4."
"Awesome motivator. I am 75 and normally 1, 2 or 3% of all users and finished in top 11% of last challenge. Sort of feel the themes of the challenges are a little childish."
I have been using this app for years and it was great. But since last update of Android it suddenly stopped working. Please fix the issue. I am sad I cannot track these months data....
"It's a good app in general, but since November 2019 the Samsung monthly challenge results are not updating. For instance it's now mid January 2020 and I'm still waiting for the December 2019 results! This is why I knocked one star off this review."
Will not install on my Pixel 5 after repeated attempts and formats to install the app. Not happy at all when I have gone and purchased a brand new watch and I can use one of the key features that I brought it for. Have tried to contact the support centre a number of times but they are unavailable
"Has worked well up until now, about 8 months in. It has suddenly decided to not full record all of my steps, these were recorded on my Samsung watch but have not been backed up to the app."
"Ive been using this app for years and worked fine until this morning. I went on my normal walk about 3000 steps and it only recorded about 100. I tried restarting my phone, uninstalling and reinstalling the app, cleared cache and still wont work."
"The one thing which I positively loved in this app is the SpO2 sensor. It is the one reason why I have stuck to Samsung phones. That feature has for some reason been progressively degraded. Now for the past 15 days, the app crashes when I try to measure SpO2 which is hidden inside stress measurement. This is FRUSTRATING."
"This used to be a really great app. The new update has ruined it for me. No longer does it say what my average heart rate is per hour, their min and max heart rates per hour don't show correctly on the graph. It now looks clunky and is not user friendly. Plus have been waiting years for the ECG to become available here in HK. It's why I bought the watch, I should've just got an Apple watch as they have had ECG here for ages. Why mess around with something that was working pretty well? It's obvious from the reviews so many people are frustrated and it's not just the heart rate part of the app that has changed drastically."
"The sleep recording is totally inaccurate. Does not record deep sleep, very frustrating as I thought I was upgrading from a Fitbit but unless this gets sorted I'll have to return my galaxy watch."
"Removing good features! Why would Samsung think that a health app shouldn't track caffeine? As important as tracking the amount, the app should also track when! Your latest update sucks! It is also my understanding they are removing weight management features. Do any of the developers understand we want less apps to use to track our stuff not more?"
This app worked fine the first month of my new S10 Plus. It stopped working for two weeks and is now working again after uninstalling and reinstalling it and Google Maps. We will see how long it continues to work.
Now requires phone permission!! There is absolutely no good reason to make this a required permission. Extremely intrusive and irresponsible design. Uninstalling. They replied with nonsense about app features. Reality is they made an intrusive permission mandatory for an optional feature. Rubbish.
"Good but the ranking in global challenge sucks . As soon a challenge starts, someone completes in a dat, which is highly impossible. This makes us to lose interest in participating the challenge."
"I used to find the app very good but it's getting worse. The last couple of weeks in the summary it's been whining because I didn't do 9000 steps a day, even though on the daily it says my target is 6000, which is what I want. Previously it worked fine. Annoying."
"If you join the global health challenge you will never be in the top 100 unless you run a 10k everyday or walk continuously for 8 hours. It would be helpful if samsung could make groups that were in the same fitness ranges instead of comparing some one like me who walks about 10000 steps a day to some who 'walks' over 200000 steps a day. This is an app that you will use to start you smart watch, maybe use for 5 months then never open again."
"This is an excellent App and is used daily and comprehensively. However, I would like to be able to open the graphs and other comparative details on my laptop in order to work with it more clearly in a larger format. Is there any possibility of this compatibility in the pipeline?"
"Hi, I have the Gear3, and unable to purchase any of the newer Samsung watches. I see there's an ecg option available, not able to download. Also on the Samsung Health app it no longer shows the route option, has this been discontinued or disabled. I love my watch but would like to keep upto date with any updates."
"Used this with the samsung watch 3. The latest update FORCES you to create and use a samsung account. I dont want my data all over samsung or use an account. Uninstalling and selling the watch3. This is absolutely ridiculous! 0/5 for forcing this on users. The response is no help. I know it requires an account now, that's my problem. Telling me to call with help making account is tone deaf and ridiculous."
the latest updated for this app is trash. it is not sync my walking step properly and it is even low sensitivity. walking all day long and it is only records as 700 steps? please fix your app ASAP otherwise i have to change to another.
"great app. very motivating. started doing daily walks and you can map your walk. tracking your speed, time and distance. I like to try to better my time and distance daily. highly recommend using this app."
"The best app of flagship Phones has become just modern day joke. By Systematic pulling of all features, you have made all sensors of S series and Note Series useless. I had been fan since S2 and N1 days and now on N9 N10 and S8+ this app is not worthwhile even to be on phones. Can't measure anything. I really dislike Samsung Strategy to ruin such a great app and even my S Gear , not sure what to do next ? Maybe not to choose Samsung products at all for avoiding such issues. You lost me.üòë"
Absolutely Love this Application. The instant connection with device's to see and change in real time is the best. No areas for improvement but do keep building!
Inaccurate step counts! Count algorithm has some serious flaw. It counts any sort of movement as a Step and the counter keeps ticking even when the phone is inside the pocket while driving!
"In all fairness I actually love this app, however recently I've noticed its stealing my stars off me in the walking challenges. Not sure what its upto but if you go on it before you reach the target it takes it off you and if your a couple of hundreds steps over it, they take your stars away. Get this sorted and I'll raise my rating."
"I used this app for more than a year to mesure my sleeping, steps, workout.... You now ask for my contacts, making calls... Plus the 2 step verification mandatory to open the app..... What's wrong with you? Why are you breaking an app that was working PERFECTLY? P.S.: Thanks for your quick answer but asking me to call you regarding my concerns is useless since I mentioned what are the issues with your app. Also note that many peoples are complaining about the same issues."
